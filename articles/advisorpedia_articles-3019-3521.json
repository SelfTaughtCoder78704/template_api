    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve met both over my long career as an executive, a consultant, and a board member. Strategists and Strategic Planners may read the same periodicals and have similar destinations in mind, but there is a difference between the two. Strategic Planners, at the outset, are disadvantaged by the definition of their role. They are staffers, not line managers. Strategic Planning positions exist inside companies, and in external consulting businesses. Consultants earn a living by the clock. The ramification of this incentive is easy to deduce. They spend weeks, sometimes months assessing, discussing, assembling teams, leading SWOT analyses, and on, and on, and on. Internal Strategic Planning managers do the same thing . . . in some cases, less. Less? Yep, they bring in consultants to do their job.</p><p> Rather than break new ground, the finished plan is usually a convoluted extension of the current strategy. Crown Corporations and government agencies are the worst offenders. British Columbia Lottery Corporation, ICBC, and BC Hydro&rsquo;s most recent strategic plans all exceed 30 pages. Take a peak; their well-crafted documents are posted as &ldquo;Service Plans&rdquo; on-line, and they differ little from prior versions. Strategic Planners are the architects of these documents. They are not brilliant strategists; they are brilliant bureaucrats. </p><p> An organization&rsquo;s best strategists are in the C-Suite, and the CEO is usually the catalyst. C-Suite strategists can draft an effective Strategic Plan within a day because they have an intimate knowledge of the business and are constantly thinking strategically. The best ones bring clarity and purpose to a document that can be written on just one piece of paper.</p><p> Here are the key differences between the species:</p><li> <strong>  Strategists are obsessed with bolstering their company&rsquo;s competitive advantage. </strong> Strategic Planners are obsessed with preparing a document.</li><li> <strong>  Strategists trash complexity so that plans are clear and transparent. </strong> Strategic Planners build plans to pre-defined formats. In the case of BC Crown Agencies, the government format demands verbosity.</li><li> <strong>  Strategists motivate employees to invest time and energy in the stated strategic direction. </strong> Strategic Planners collaborate with management to uncover strategic direction.</li><li> <strong>  Strategists take an enterprise to the next level. </strong> Strategic Planners never transform an enterprise. <br/>  </li><p> In the final analysis, companies with a C-Suite that drives strategy are action-oriented, less bureaucratic, and better-performing. I&rsquo;ll leave you with one question. Why don&rsquo;t giant innovators like Apple, Google or Facebook have Strategic Planning Departments?</p>",

We&rsquo;ve got to talk about this stuff otherwise nothing would ever get done.</p><p> But, if I was to be a fly on the wall in most organisations, conversations about working relationships and how they are fairing, would be far more scarce.

What have been the wins? What have we learned as a result? Have there been moments or situations when we really worked well together? What was present or at play for this to happen? How can we shine a light on this and create opportunities for us to replicate this? <br/>  </li><p> A bit like a marriage, if we only focus our attention on task-focussed communication, then sooner or later the cracks will start to show. As uncomfortable as it may be, I urge you to include some of these &ldquo;how are we going?&rdquo; questions into your conversational vocabulary with your direct reports.</p><p> Do it and tell me what happens as a result.</p>",

But the problem with many of these comparisons is that they lump people together, regardless of how much they earn.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.finrafoundation.org/web/groups/foundation/@foundation/documents/foundation/snapshot-of-investor-households-in-america.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new study  </a> </u>  by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation looks at one type of account &ndash; taxable investment accounts &ndash; and controls for income as well as two other characteristics that influence wealth: education and age. The study, using data from a 2012 survey of more than 25,000 U.S. households, found that when everything else is equal, black American households were still 7 percentage points less likely to have taxable investment accounts than white households; and Hispanic households were 4 percentage points less likely to have such taxable accounts than white households.</p><p> FINRA also identifies other characteristics typical of the one-third of households with a taxable account.</p><p> Those with incomes over $50,000 were much more likely to have them &ndash; by 22 percentage points &ndash; than households with lower incomes. Other contributors include a college degree, greater financial literacy, and a higher tolerance for risk. Couples were also more likely to have a taxable investment account but households with dependents less so.</p><p> FINRA added, &ldquo;Households that own taxable investment accounts are more affluent and financially knowledgeable than households with only retirement accounts, which are in turn more affluent and financially knowledgeable than households without investment accounts.&rdquo;</p><p> Note: 33 percent of U.S. households have taxable investment accounts; 29 percent have only tax-favored retirement accounts; and 38 percent have neither.</p>",

    "title": "How to Teach Your Kids About Money",
    "link": "how-to-teach-your-kids-about-money",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Teaching your kids about personal finance can seem daunting, but children can understand the concepts of working for money, saving, and buying necessities from a young age. In fact, teaching your children about money as they grow up is a good way to put them on solid financial footing.</p><p> Whether your child is 7 or 17, it&rsquo;s never too early &mdash; or too late &mdash; to provide financial education and lessons. Use these five ideas to help teach your kids what they need to know about money.</p><h3> Start Early</h3><p> <br/> The earlier you start incorporating money lessons into everyday conversation with your kids, the better. Many children who don&rsquo;t get to have conversations with trusted adults understand money in an abstract way. If finance isn&rsquo;t a topic up for discussion and all kids see is cash coming out of the ATM machine, they&rsquo;re not going to understand that you worked hard to earn that money.</p><p> Talk to your children about where your money comes from and how people work for money. It&rsquo;s not given, and money itself comes at a cost &mdash; you exchange your time and effort to earn it.</p><p> The sooner you start explaining that money doesn&rsquo;t come from trees, the sooner children will start to respect money and treat it as something to be conserved rather than squandered.</p><h3> Get Kids Involved in Household Budgeting</h3><p> <br/> One of the easiest ways to have your children understand finances is  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-budget-and-manage-your-finances-on-a-variable-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   involving them in the household budget  </a> </u> . This means involving your child when you plan your grocery list, go shopping for necessities and big ticket items, or discuss family vacations.</p><p> This step is crucial because it shows a whole host of connections, like the relationships between buying what you need versus what you want and  <u>  how decision-making works in your family </u> . It introduces children to the concept that money is not infinite, and families have to set priorities when deciding how to spend their money.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to provide all the details, all the time. But allow kids a stake in the game: involve them in the decision-making process about where to go on your next vacation and how the cost of transportation, accommodations, and other necessities may impact the discretionary money you can spend on the trip.</p><h3> Use Technology</h3><p> <br/> For children today, technology is a huge part of their lives and shapes how they understand money. Money may not necessarily be represented by tangible paper bills and coins for your kids, but rather debit and credit cards. If you use digital tools to help you manage money, introduce your kids to the same thing.</p><p> Apps such as Kids Money will teach children to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/7-money-moves-financially-savvy-couples/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   save for large purchases  </a> </u>  by entering how much they need for the item, how much money the child brings in (allowance, gift money, etc.), and how long it will take to save that amount. This is a great way to help children understand  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-invest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   long-term savings plans  </a> </u> . It can also help introduce the concept of delayed gratification.</p><p> P2K Money is another free app you can download that introduces concepts like budgeting, savings, and having a &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; to track  <u>  savings goals </u> . P2K is a much simpler app, which makes it easier for younger children to understand.</p><h3> Encourage Entrepreneurship</h3><p> <br/> If your kids are constantly asking for more money or want an &ldquo;advance&rdquo; on their allowance, it&rsquo;s time to introduce them to side jobs. Tell your kids that working extra will allow them to make more money on their own terms so they can buy what they value.</p><p> Depending on the age of your children, direct them to things they can actually do. If you have a younger child, maybe they can help a neighbor pull weeds or do additional chores around the house.</p><p> A middle school or high school aged child can babysit or walk dogs for extra cash. Teenagers have even more flexibility, including the ability to  <u>  start their own business </u>  (based on their talents and interests) or picking up a part-time job in the summer.</p><p> While not every child will be interested in this step, it&rsquo;s a good way to show your children that they can change their financial situation by working harder or  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/human-capital-investing-in-your-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   developing their talents and skills  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Help Them Understand Credit</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Teenagers and credit cards&rdquo; can sound like the opening line to a horror movie for parents, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. Even if you&rsquo;re only getting started teaching your teen about money now, it&rsquo;s still possible to teach them how to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/what-millennials-need-to-know-about-their-credit-score/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   use a credit card responsibly  </a> </u> .</p><p> This step requires a little more discussion with your older kids, as you&rsquo;ll want to go over interest rates, credit scores, and not living beyond their means. One of the best ways to help your teenager understand credit is to give them a secured or prepaid credit card to use.</p><p> Continue teaching budgeting skills, but allow your teenager to potentially make and learn from their mistakes. Teaching your child about credit before they go off to college will provide them with the an informed and practical knowledge they&rsquo;ll need as young adults managing finances on their own.</p><p> When teaching your kids about money, it is crucial to let them direct the conversation. Pay attention to questions your child asks about money, the household budget,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-invest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   or investing  </a> </u> . Keeping the conversation open and honest means that if your kids have more questions, they&rsquo;ll understand they can come to you for information.</p><p> Raising financially-literate children doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult if you follow a logical progression that allows your kids to gradually build their understanding. By starting early with the basics, you&rsquo;re building a financial platform for your kids to build on to their teenage years and beyond.</p>",

    "title": "9 Tips for the First 6-Months of Your New Career",
    "link": "9-tips-for-the-first-6-months-of-your-new-career",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Marianna | <u>  NewCareer101 </u></p><p> The first 6 months of your new career are crucial. This is the time when you learn your new role, get to know the culture of your office, and start earning the respect of your managers. Make sure you stay on top of your game even when you start to feel comfortable at the new job. Below are 9 tips not to forget for your first 6 months.</p><p> <strong>  1. Don&rsquo;t be Late </strong> <br/> Although you should never be late for your job, absolutely make sure not to be late when you are still a new employee. You want to make sure to set a good impression and avoid making your boss wonder where you are in the morning. This is a new commute so leaving your house ten or fifteen minutes earlier than usual will be a good idea. If you forgot to get gas the night before or if there is an accident on the freeway, it will give you time to still make it to the new job on time.</p><p> <strong>  2. Dress Professionally </strong> <br/> The longer you are at your new job, the more comfortable you will become, especially as you experience the culture of your office and as you get to know your coworkers. If you see other coworkers dressing more casual, you may want to as well. However, before doing so, use your boss as an example. If your boss wears a suit every day, think twice before coming to work in jeans. Use your boss as an example as to what you should wear. If management tends to dress up, make sure you are doing the same. The management team will notice that you maintain professionalism even after your interview. <br/> <br/> Are other employees leave right at 5:00pm? Instead of taking off for the day, why not put in an extra 10 min?</p><p> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t be the First Person to go Home </strong> <br/> Trust me, people will notice if you are the first one out the door at the end of the day. Staying for a few extra minutes will give you the opportunity to plan for the next day, follow up on e-mails or return phone calls. Working those extra minutes demonstrates that you are hardworking and dedicated to your new job.</p><p> <strong>  4. Ask Questions </strong> <br/> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions. If you really don&rsquo;t know the answer, it&rsquo;s better to ask and learn. You&rsquo;re a new employee, so there are many aspects of the job that you are not expected to know. This is your chance to ask questions and really master your role. Remember, you will become an expert in your role if you ask and learn now compared to 6 months down the road. <br/> <br/> Booking a trip to Thailand? You might want to wait until you have put in a few months at the new job first.</p><p> <strong>  5. Postpone Your Vacation </strong> <br/> Many companies advise not to take vacation time within the first 6 months of your new job. This is the time when you are learning your new role, understanding the culture of the company and establishing yourself as a dedicated employee. If your annual trip to Florida lands within the first few months of your new job, you may want to think about postponing your trip. If you do have a vacation planned that you can&rsquo;t reschedule, let the hiring manager know during the interview process and, if you already won them over, there is a good chance they will approve your time off. Overall, best practice is to make sure you build the reputation that you are a dedicated employee before you plan your next vacation.</p><p> <strong>  6. Avoid Gossip </strong> <br/> In every career there will be employees who gossip. Avoid gossip at all costs. If people see you participating, they will keep coming back to you with the newest news going around the office. Even if you are not the one spreading rumors, most likely your co-workers and managers may start to see that you are a part of it. This could ultimately result in a poor reputation or even hinder chances for career advancement.</p><p> <strong>  7. Put in the Extra Mile </strong> <br/> You are in a new career, so it is important to put in the extra mile. If you are in a sales role, start to read sales books. If you are in an IT role, learn more about IT lingo. Go the extra mile outside of work to really learn more about your job, company, and industry. If you do this, you will start to stand out, because you will become an expert in your field much faster compared to other new employees. The more you know, the faster your learning curve will be! <br/> <br/> Make sure to take detailed notes within your first few weeks.</p><p> <strong>  8. Take Notes </strong> <br/> The first few months are dedicated to learning your new role. You will be learning new software, your day-to-day functions, and much more. During this time, your mind will reach capacity on how much you can retain. Make sure to take detailed notes as a resource for you once you are on your own. It will also show you are listening and dedicated to learning your new role.</p><p> <strong>  9. Stay Off Your Phone </strong> <br/> Employees across all industries are constantly on their phones throughout the day. Many people are texting, checking Facebook, or posting pictures on Instagram while they are working. At some companies, this may be a part of the culture. However, within the first 30 days of your new career, you will be overwhelmed by new hire orientation, learning a new system, and just trying to retain the information you are taught each day. Besides the fact that your phone may be distracting, it also will be noticed by other colleagues and managers. You want to create a reputation of being hard working, detail-oriented, and driven. Staying off your phone while at work will help you build just that!</p>",

    "content": "In the digital era, you might be forgiven for thinking that face-to-face event marketing is destined to go the way of the dodo. But it seems that the B2B industry still thrives on human interaction, and face-to-face events are still one of the best ways to generate leads.<p> The key to seeing success from your event marketing efforts is to combine them with an integrated digital marketing strategy. Helpfully, an article over on Business2Community recently offered some great tips - most of which equally apply whether you&rsquo;re running the event itself or you're an exhibitor or sponsor.</p><h3> 1. Pre-event engagement</h3><p> <br/> Harness your existing online activity to engage prospects before the event takes place. Integrate the event into your email marketing, using campaigns that will get people excited. You should also blog about it well ahead of time on your website to raise awareness and hopefully get it up those Google search pages; just remember to keep the tone light-hearted and engaging - for example, you could give top-tips for attending the event, or background profiles on keynote speakers.</p><p> A great example of something fun, yet incredibly useful, comes from VM World, an event I&rsquo;m currently involved with: their  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.vmworld.com/en/europe/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   'Convince Your Manager&rsquo;  </a> </u>  template helps potential delegates make the ROI case to their boss that booking them on a flight to sunny Barcelona is a no-brainer!</p><h3> 2. During the event</h3><p> <br/> Social media provides a great platform for you to shout about your event while it's taking place, while also engaging people who were unable to attend. You'll need to combine as many channels as possible for full effectiveness - ideally including Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. Perhaps it's time to give Periscope a whirl to see if that attracts the right type of audience, while positioning you and your brand at the vanguard of video streaming.</p><p> In fact video in general is a great way to boost engagement levels and give people who aren't there the most powerful taste of what they're missing. These should be bite-sized snippets of video, including interviews with staff, quick Q&amp;As with delegates or even just a glimpse of the venue to what people&rsquo;s appetite for next year&rsquo;s event.</p><h3> 3. Post-event engagement</h3><p> <br/> The content you collect at the event is still just as valuable once it's all over. Use it to publish key insights from the event and position yourself as experts in your field, and to remind people to make sure they attend next time! Try to streamline your findings so that videos become compilations, and statistics become easily digestible infographics.</p><p> In summary, far from killing off event marketing, digital technologies need to be leveraged to improve event performance and maximise your ROI.</p>",

    "title": "6 Keys to Engaging Your Remote Workforce",
    "link": "6-keys-to-engaging-your-remote-workforce",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In my last role in Corporate America I had 14 people working for me, but only two of them were actually physically co-located with me in the office in San Francisco. On my team I had people in eight different cities covering three different time zones.  <strong>  It wasn&rsquo;t practical or cost effective to have frequent in-person off-sites </strong> , although I did try to do that at least once every eighteen months.</p><p> I get asked the following question probably more than any other one when I speak to audiences,  <strong>  &ldquo;How do I engage my remote employees and make them more a part of the team?&rdquo; </strong>  To answer that, it is first important to understand that even your employees co-located in the same facility, can feel remote. How many times has someone that worked for you (or maybe even yourself) relied on emails, texts or in-house instant messaging systems to tell you something, rather than get up and talk face-to-face?  <strong>  Remote doesn&rsquo;t have to be defined by miles or hours. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Here are some tips to keep everyone on your team engaged  </strong> and I&rsquo;m going to warn in advance that I&rsquo;m going &lsquo;old school&rsquo;.</p><p> 1. <strong>  Think of each of your employees as remote workers, regardless of location </strong>  so that you are starting out on an even playing field. That means that one group is not more important than others, a common complaint that many remote workers feel when there is a group of people co-located with the boss.</p><p> 2.   <strong>  The concept of &lsquo;one-on-one&rsquo; weekly meetings is not only not dead it is imperative that with a remote workforce this happens.  </strong> You must make the time for a personal interaction with everyone on your team. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you aren&rsquo;t talking more if needed, but rather its about making a statement that this time between you and your employee is sacred and reinforces how important they are to the organization. Even if it&rsquo;s just 30 minutes, it&rsquo;s time well spent.</p><p> 3. <strong>  You must have a scheduled all team staff meeting at least once a month that doesn&rsquo;t get cancelled. </strong>  As important as a manager&rsquo;s one-on-one conversation is with each person on the team, there is such power in the collective group.</p><p> 4. <strong>  With all the tools available today for video conferencing, use this whenever possible so that people can virtually &lsquo;see&rsquo; each other. </strong>  Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not always feasible when you have people in so many locations including those working from home offices but perhaps make it a rule that at least once a quarter people need to go to sites that have the technology so that connections can be strengthened.</p><p> 5. <strong>  When you have staff calls, make sure to start off by connecting first with each person </strong>  on the phone by going around the horn and asking a question that relates individually to them, be it about a work project they are involved in or asking how their child&rsquo;s birthday party was that weekend. That small act will get them engaged in the conversation from the get go rather than lose them while you have a dialogue with the people sitting physically around your conference table.</p><p> 6. <strong>  Always follow the golden rules of being transparent, sharing information and giving context by explaining the why behind the what of decisions you&rsquo;ve made. </strong></p><p> Because I&rsquo;m feeling generous today, here is one bonus tip that I&rsquo;m going to share:</p><p> 7. <strong>  Make your celebrations virtual by including everyone. </strong>  One of my rituals during the end of year holiday season is to have each person on the team be assigned one of their colleagues to buy a gift for and put a price limit on the gift to ensure everyone can comfortably participate, I usually did $25. It&rsquo;s amazing how creative you can get with so little money. The rules were that the wrapped gift had to be at their office three days before the group call and it couldn&rsquo;t be opened beforehand. We then all dialed in and virtually went around and had people open the gift. Many took pictures and emailed it to the group.</p><p> There are so many share apps out there in tech land that can help you connect as a team. Explore ways to keep everyone plugged in to what&rsquo;s going on and allow them to have input in to the conversation. While what I&rsquo;m suggesting may seem overwhelming in terms of time to a manager, it is well worth it in the long run.  <strong>  Having engaged employees who are aligned with where you are going, and are able to have a voice in the business will mean more productivity, less turnover and more commitment to the team in the long run. </strong></p>",

While I don&rsquo;t believe you should equate your self-worth with your net worth, I do believe that developing a healthy relationship with money is an important ingredient in your overall happiness.</p><p> Here are four strategies you can use to embark on your own happiness project, so that you can be truly happy, healthy, and wealthy.</p><li> <strong>  Celebrate the experience. </strong>  According to Dan Gilbert, Harvard University psychology professor and author of &ldquo;Stumbling on Happiness,&rdquo; the key to being happy is to spend your money on experiences rather than on accumulating material objects. Memories of people, places, and activities don&rsquo;t lose their luster the way stuff does. Prioritize relationships over possessions and status. Spending time with close friends or family, even when the activity you&rsquo;re sharing is not exciting, makes people happy because it fosters a sense of togetherness and connection. For example, as I have mentioned in previous columns, it&rsquo;s not easy raising financially savvy kids in consumer culture where delayed gratification seems like an outmoded concept. When my kids came home with good report cards, instead of buying them toys or gifts, we went to a water park or concert, or shared some other activity together.</li><li> <strong>  Spend on others. </strong>  Experiments by Harvard University researchers showed that spending money on others (&ldquo;prosocial&rdquo; spending) improves emotional and physical health. Contrary to expectations&mdash;and despite people&rsquo;s inclination to want to indulge themselves&mdash;one of the best ways to derive the greatest personal benefit from a $20 windfall is to spend it prosocially. A concrete example of how my family integrates prosocial spending into our activities and budget is by preparing school supplies for children in transitional housing, and by purchasing gloves, mittens, and scarves for winter coat drives. Giving generously to charities, friends, and coworkers may well be a fundamental part of human nature, as well as a productive means of improving our overall health and the lives of others.</li><li> <strong>  Enjoy mini-splurges. </strong>  Most of us have already discovered for ourselves that an extravagant purchase does not result in long-term happiness. Still, we often focus mistakenly on earning money and spending money&mdash;while overlooking using money to create and provide value. When we focus on money solely as a medium of exchange, we reflexively seek ways to have more money so that we can do more or buy more things. Most of the things we buy have only short-term value to us, and some have no value at all. Money is for spending after all. I explain to my clients that I want to make sure that they invest for their retirement so that they can continue to enjoy their splurges in the future as well. Treating yourself to inexpensive indulgences is a more prudent&mdash;and effective&mdash;way to achieve sustainable happiness.</li><li> <strong>  Buy what you value. </strong>  Just as I teach my kids not to succumb to peer pressure, I know it can be hard to say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; My mantra is a Will Rogers aphorism: &ldquo;Too many people spend money they haven&rsquo;t earned, to buy things they don&rsquo;t want, to impress people that they don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Learning to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; can be empowering. It becomes much easier to resist temptation if you can identify and clarify what you value. Discovering what you value is a worthwhile investment of your time. Spending time reflecting on your financial life goals can help lead you in the right direction on your own happiness project. <br/>  </li><h3> Don&rsquo;t Ignore the Ancient Wisdom About Happiness</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes the advice we need to be happier was first given centuries ago. For example, most of us would benefit by taking to heart the wisdom of Seneca, a Roman philosopher, statesman, and dramatist:</p><p> &ldquo;True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.&rdquo;</p>",

    "link": "create-change-5-basic-journey-mapping-principles",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  There are five basic principles that journey maps must adhere to. What are they? </strong> <br/> <br/> Once upon a time (and still today), journey maps were created on butcher paper with post-it notes. I&rsquo;ve used this approach to create journey maps in the past, and while it's a valid and viable methodology, it makes it difficult to share the maps, to administer updates, and to transfer knowledge. It&rsquo;s also time-consuming and fosters that one-and-done attitude that becomes the death knell of journey mapping. <br/> <br/> Then we started using tools like Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio, which prove to be expensive, and the output is static and two-dimensional. Plus, these tools are also time consuming; you end up spending hours drawing &ndash; time that could or should be spent on strategy and execution. <br/> <br/> Mapping tools had to evolve. Why? Because nothing was being done with the maps. People failed to see the value in this very important exercise. We are asked often, &ldquo;So what? I mapped. What do I do with it now?&rdquo; Maps are supposed to be that catalyst for change both throughout the organization and for the customer experience; without adhering to some basic principles of mapping, maps become useless. (Side note: Touchpoint Dashboard was purpose built to help with those principles and to ensure maps are that catalyst for change.) <br/> <br/> What are those basic principles of mapping? Other than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/08/the-most-important-rule-of-journey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the obvious, which I've written about recently  </a> </u> , five important principles to adhere to include: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Maps must be collaborative/collaborated. </strong> <br/> To break down those organizational silos and to get buy-in across the organization for the change that must happen, cross-functional collaboration is necessary. This collaboration is a great reminder to the various key stakeholders that the customer experience isn't one dimensional, i.e., just because the customer calls support doesn't mean support is the only department involved in that interaction. This collaboration also facilitates the assignment of owners to the steps in the journey so that we know who to call on when something is broken. And finally, customer collaboration is key; customers must validate the maps you&rsquo;ve created. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Maps bring the journey to life. </strong> <br/> Maps help bring the customer experience to life. To amplify this, you'll want to add visuals &ndash; images, audio, or video &ndash; of what the customer is doing, thinking, or feeling. And bring customer feedback and data into the touchpoints. Attach any artifacts to the map or to a touchpoint to add greater understanding about the customer journey. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Maps should allow you to analyze and prioritize touchpoints and improvement opportunities. </strong> <br/> Map your customers journey using a tool that's data driven. The more data you bring into the map, into a touchpoint, the better your ability to analyze the journey and to prioritize improvement opportunities. And the better your ability to drive change. When you can analyze your touchpoints, it&rsquo;s more likely that the map will not just sit on the shelf or just hang on the wall and fail to be the catalyst it&rsquo;s supposed to be. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Maps must be shared. </strong> <br/> Once a map is created, it can't just sit on the desk of the person who created it. It must be shared throughout the organization in order to tell the customer&rsquo;s story, to get buy-in for the experience and its improvements, and to educate employees about the customer&rsquo;s journey. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Maps should be updated. </strong> <br/> As improvements are made to the experience and as the experience evolves, you need to be able to update your maps in order to reflect the latest current state. From there, you'll iterate, continue design efforts, and cycle back through these five principles. Continuously. <br/> <br/> When you adhere to these basic principles of mapping, you can be certain that your maps become the catalyst for change that they were meant to be! <br/> <br/> Every contact we have with a customer influences whether or not they&rsquo;ll come back. We have to be great every time or we&rsquo;ll lose them. -Kevin Stirtz <br/> <br/>  </p>",

A better way may be to have a pocketful of SRSV statements that you can draw upon to engage just the person you&rsquo;re talking with.

    "content": "<p> Controlling unwanted thoughts is not the problem. Believing, trusting, or taking direction from them is.  How often have you heard people say, &ldquo;Control your thoughts, control your life?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;You are what you think about.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;What you think about is what you will attract.&rdquo; What these statements don&rsquo;t take into account is the fact that our brain generates all sorts of thoughts, many of which come without notice, and some are good and some are not very good; in fact some, are downright hurtful and self-destructive. You don&rsquo;t want to have the latter, you don&rsquo;t ask for them, and nor do I. But they come on unpredictably. But are they so unpredictable.</p><p> Those of you who have been following my writings or read my book Brain Drain know about what I call the automatic brain (AB for short). Our AB has one function&mdash;to protect us from danger, threat, or vulnerability. When it detects such, it releases an electrochemical response that we know as the fight or flight response. But this reaction is not simply you getting scared. This AB reaction leads us into behaviors and emotions that sometimes show up as fear, anger, rage, or even sadness, depression and withdraw.</p><p> However, what most people don&rsquo;t realize, and what set me on this quest to begin with, is that this brain also creates thoughts so that we fight and flee danger. Thoughts can be the most troubling and interfering element on any road to growth or success. And this should tell you something as it did, and still does, tell me. What it tells me is that nothing comes out of the blue&mdash;not negative behaviors/emotions or thoughts. If this premise is correct that means that negative thoughts arise from our AB trying to protect us from something. The actual thoughts, in my opinion, are less important than what is going on when the negative thoughts arise. For instance, if you get a thought while driving that you are going to lose control, suddenly, swerve and hit the concrete barrier or person on the side of the road, your AB is simply trying to shake you into focus to protect you from the &ldquo;danger&rdquo; of driving.  Or if you are hiking and cannot bring yourself to the edge of the overlook because of thoughts that you are going to lose control and fling yourself off, that&rsquo;s your AB.</p><p> But what about the negative thoughts that pop into your head when things are going well, or you are succeeding and moving ahead. These come on because your AB detects some danger, threat, or vulnerability from your success.</p><p> <strong>  These seven steps can help you gain more control. </strong></p><li> Do not believe everything you think.</li><li> Understand that unwanted thoughts always arise in order to protect you.</li><li> Try to identify the circumstance that caused the thought.</li><li> Realize that the circumstance is unlikely dangerous at all.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t fight the thoughts. It is more normal to get negative thoughts than not.</li><li> Recite in your mind, &ldquo;There is no danger, there is not threat, I am safe,&rdquo; whenever getting the thoughts.</li><li> If you get a negative thought that is particularly hurtful, finish it off. For instance, if you get a thought that says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a loser.&rdquo; Finish it by saying in your mind, &ldquo;Yes, I am a loser. I am a loser if a play a game I know nothing about. But since my life is not a game and I play by my own rules I am a winner.&rdquo;</li>",

During social media&rsquo;s original unveil, investment advisers were hesitant to incorporate these new innovations into their daily business practices given the lack of clear regulatory guidance.

Marketing, in general, is evolving. RIA firms want to not only reach prospects and clients, but to engage with them in an interactive and personable manner.</li><li> <strong>  Social media is cost efficient:  </strong> As it stands today, there is no cost to create a social media profile and post messages publicly. However, there is an investment in time and firms need to remember to budget for proper social media archiving as posts on social media need to be treated just like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-advertising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   any other form of advertising  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Social media is an efficient way to learn: </strong> Social media shouldn't just be viewed as a tool to reach clients and prospects, but also a highly efficient way to stay informed on the latest industry trends and relevant news. Such trends and news can lead to new ideas for content to create and share with relevant prospects. It's also very easy to start following other  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-firms-that-adopted-technology-grew-aum-faster-in-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   successful RIA firms  </a> </u>  utilizing social media from across the country to gain great insights and tips <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Social Media: Potential Mistakes  </strong></p><p> When not monitored or executed in a thoughtful manner, a firm&rsquo;s social media efforts can quickly turn sour and lead to regulatory issues. Falling out of compliance will not only put a firm at risk, but can discredit the firm's public reputation. A few tips to keep in mind include:</p><li> <strong>  Establish a social media policy: </strong> Be sure to establish clear ground rules and properly educate the firm's entire staff on the proper and improper uses of social media. The policy should also make it clear which platforms are allowed for professional use and which are not.</li><li> <strong>  Archive all posts: </strong>  While reviewing all social media posts just like any other form of investment adviser advertising is a good starting point, it's also required that all posts be properly archived and available for review during a regulatory audit.</li><li> <strong>  Never mislead or embellish: </strong>  Use caution and be sure what the social media posting is saying is 100% accurate and factual.  <br/>  </li><p> From a more practical business standpoint, we often recommend that RIA firms do not attempt to establish a presence on every social media platform. Instead, firms should focus on perhaps two platforms that are most relevant to their types of clients. It's important to remember that each social media platform serves its own unique purpose and may also appeal to different types of audiences. Furthermore, simply creating a social media account and beginning to post is unlikely to yield immediate or even long term success. Social media needs to be part of a firm's broader marketing strategy and serves as a channel to distribute the firm's content.</p><p> Social media can be a very valuable tool for RIA firms to engage with both clients and prospects.

    "content": "<h3> Organizational change can cause a lot of anxiety for companies.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s no surprise, since only 25% of change initiatives succeed in the long term, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.towerswatson.com/en/Press/2013/08/Only-One-Quarter-of-Employers-Are-Sustaining-Gains-From-Change-Management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Towers Watson survey  </a> </u> . And since they range from mergers to reorganizations to business pivots, these are high-stakes moves.</p><p> Take Twitter for example. They spent months with an interim CEO who finally stepped into official position on Monday, then the next day they  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/13/unpacking-the-twitter-layoffs-its-all-about-whos-calling-the-shots/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   announce that they're laying off 366 people  </a> </u> . So why is this worrying news? Organizational change is difficult. When done in a brash or undeliberate manner, you're simply setting yourself up for failure. Let's take a look at the do's and don'ts of change management.</p><h3> Organizational Change Case Studies</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Atlassian </strong></p><p> First up is  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Atlassian  </a> </u> &rsquo;s performance management overhaul. In 2011, the company decided the traditional ratings-based biannual performance review system wasn&rsquo;t achieving the intended results. Because reviews were infrequent, employees dreaded them. In addition, since numeric ratings of performance determined a worker&rsquo;s bonus, undue attention was heaped on whether someone was a &ldquo;four&rdquo; or &ldquo;five&rdquo; &mdash; a relatively arbitrary difference.</p><p> To address the issue, Atlassian  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.managementexchange.com/story/atlassians-big-experiment-performance-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trashed its existing review process  </a> </u>  in favor of a more continuous and less numeric model. Instead of a biannual formal review, managers and employees now discuss performance once a month, during an already-scheduled one-on-one.</p><p> <strong>  2. Pearson </strong></p><p> Publishing giant  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pearson.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pearson  </a> </u>  took on a much bigger change project at the end of 2012, when John Fallon took the CEO reins from longtime leader Marjorie Scardino. Rather than getting a feel for the way the company operated during his first few months on the job, Fallon announced an entirely new game plan &mdash; termed the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/11/25/brace-yourself-pearson-has-a-new-global-education-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Global Education Strategy&rdquo;  </a> </u>  &mdash; from the jump. Furthermore, he implemented a massive reorg that grouped the workforce into six discrete business units. <br/>  </p><h3> How These Companies Pulled It Off</h3><p> <br/> So how did each of these companies lead organizational change initiatives? There were some similarities in their approaches:</p><p> <strong>  1. Both companies went big </strong></p><p> Atlassian didn&rsquo;t just change one aspect of the performance management &mdash; it changed the entire process. Pearson didn&rsquo;t just add an addendum to its strategy &mdash; it shifted the company&rsquo;s focus entirely and reorganized to support the new plan.</p><p> <strong>  2. Each initiative was launched in a top-down manner </strong></p><p> At Pearson,  <u>  Fallon took to the company intranet </u>  to blog about changes and explain what to expect. At Atlassian, HR invested in training to teach managers how to coach employees effectively.</p><p> <strong>  3. They leveraged technology </strong></p><p> Both companies leaned on technology to achieve their ends &mdash; the intranet at Pearson, and a new performance management system at Atlassian.</p><p> However, there were also two key differences:</p><p> 1. Atlassian&rsquo;s change management initiative was spurred from an internal observation (reviews are not effective), while Pearson&rsquo;s materialized from an external force (new CEO and changing industry).</p><p> 2. Pearson seemingly issued more internal marketing among its employees than Atlassian.</p><p> Transparency and communication are best practices for all kinds of change management initiatives. Employees will come around to the change more quickly if they feel consulted and informed. <br/>  </p><h3> Change Management Examples to Avoid</h3><p> <br/> The one upside to public failures of change initiatives is that the rest of us can learn from their mistakes. Here are three recent examples from the retail space:</p><p> <strong>  1. Walmart </strong></p><p> Nearly a decade ago, the &ldquo;Everyday Low Prices&rdquo; seller of food, home goods, electronics, music, clothing, and just about anything else you can think of looked to expand its market. They brought in higher-priced, upscale items like trendy fashion in order to attract new customers.</p><p> But the move never really took hold. Higher-end consumers were decidedly underwhelmed, and lower-end consumers started looking elsewhere for bargains. Walmart  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/wal-mart-finds-fewer-sales-going-upscale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   got a new advertising agency  </a> </u>  and forged on, but it was not to be. In 2012, they announced  <u>  plans to refocus efforts on low prices </u> .</p><p> (Recently, however, now that its traditional superstores are losing traffic,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-looks-to-grow-by-embracing-smaller-stores-1404787817\" target=\"_blank\">   Walmart has begun experimenting with upscale goods in smaller stores  </a> </u> . Will this strategy work better the second time around? We&rsquo;ll see.)</p><p> <strong>  2. JCPenney </strong></p><p> Sometimes, no matter how good or sensible an idea, consumers aren&rsquo;t having it.</p><p> The year was 2012, and rather than offer sales and coupons, JCPenney had a better idea: &ldquo;month-long values&rdquo; that would do away with the hype and drama of specials and so-called &ldquo;reductions.&rdquo; Instead, consumers could rest assured they were always getting the best price, period.</p><p> Unfortunately, customers hated the idea and criticized JCP&rsquo;s implementation. The company suffered a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/Analyst_JCPenney_rebranding_worse_than_we_thought_11943.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   20% drop in profits in the first quarter of 2012  </a> </u> , along with strong negative consumer feedback. JCP&rsquo;s then-president, Michael Francis, announced his resignation soon thereafter.</p><p> Unfortunately for JCP, consumers want sales, and they want coupons even more. There's something about getting a deal, even a fake one, that feels good.</p><p> <strong>  3. Borders </strong></p><p> The giant brick-and-mortar store used to be the mainstay of the book market. But with the rise of online sales, physical stores suffered, and by 2011,  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/18/borders-may-be-dead-but-e-reader-kobo-is-still-alive-and-kicking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Borders announced  </a> </u>  that it was closing its 399 stores and laying off 11,000 workers. Borders&rsquo; main competitor, Barnes &amp; Noble, was having a tough time as well, but B&amp;N had one thing Borders didn&rsquo;t: an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/nook/379003208\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   e-reader  </a> </u>  already entrenched in the market. Borders&rsquo; e-reader was simply too little, too late to make a difference.</p><p> When changes are too incompatible with the existing brand &mdash; or when they just come too late &mdash; the odds are stacked against them.</p><h3> Deciding Whether to Let People Go</h3><p> <br/> Before making cuts the first step of your change plan, it&rsquo;s important to stop and examine if they&rsquo;ll make the company or its change initiative more efficient.</p><p> Take a look at  <u>  Virginia Mason Medical Center </u> . Their approach to restructuring was surprising. When Dr. Gary Kaplan became CEO in 2002, he was faced with a tangle of problems that included million-dollar losses and fading staff morale. And when he tackled those problems, he also instituted a no-layoff policy.</p><p> 78% of Virginia Mason&rsquo;s costs are labor, so leaving that intact meant serious work was needed everywhere else. Part of Kaplan&rsquo;s motivation was to get buy-in from the staff. They might not be committed to making the solutions work if, he said, &ldquo;they might improve themselves right out of a job.&rdquo;</p><p> Inspired by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.toyota-global.com/company/vision_philosophy/toyota_production_system/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Toyota Production System  </a> </u> , Kaplan and his team created what eventually became the Virginia Mason Production System (VMPS). Focused on cutting waste and improving process, this philosophy still guides the hospital today.</p><p> The VMPS worked. Over two years, Virginia Mason saw savings between $12 and 15 million. Productivity increased, and staff whose positions became redundant (remember, they couldn&rsquo;t be fired) were redeployed within the hospital.</p><p> <a href=\"http://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/downsizing-isnt-what-its-cracked-up-to-be/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Research provides conflicting answers on whether cuts work  </u>  . </a>  It also risks employee morale, sacrifices institutional memory, and in some cases doesn&rsquo;t reduce costs. A 2009 study indicates that the gains might not outweigh the losses:</p><li> Productivity improved in only 21% of cases </li><li> 40% of employees lost motivation after layoffs </li><li> 41% of employees lost respect for their employer </li><h3> Reasons for Organizational Change</h3><p> <br/> Here are a few examples of obstacles you can turn into opportunities:</p><p> <strong>  1. Company performance </strong></p><p> Are your organization&rsquo;s goals or productivity quotas not being met? Take charge to close these gaps. Maybe reorganizing teams and reallocating personnel can win more efficiency. You can take a look at the distribution of budget and resources to make sure everyone has the tools they need. You might also work with individual employees during performance evaluations to align each person&rsquo;s goals with the big-picture vision.</p><p> <strong>  2. New technology </strong></p><p> Has your organization kept up with the innovations in your industry? Or what about social media? From attracting job candidates on Facebook to engaging with customers on Twitter, the rules of recruiting and marketing have been rewritten. Make sure you stay relevant, whether that means training your employees, hiring new personnel to bring in expertise, or restructuring some of your existing processes.</p><p> <strong>  3. High turnover </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re not keeping as many employees for as long as you&rsquo;d expect, reach out and find out why. Exit interviews are vital, but don&rsquo;t wait until someone quits to react. Reach out to see if the members of your company are happy &mdash; and if not, why not. Do managers need additional training? Is the company culture in need of an overhaul? Engagement surveys let your employees tell you how your organization is doing now, before they decide to leave.</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t always possible to predict when organizational change needs to happen, but you can keep an eye out for the signs that the time of need is approaching. Being proactive gives you more time to prepare for success.</p><h3> The Importance of Culture</h3><p> <br/> A report by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what-we-think/reports-white-papers/article-display/cultures-role-organizational-change\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Strategy&amp;  </a> </u>  points to some of the reasons why this is true. Take a look at some of the top reasons employees say that they resist change:</p><li> 44% don&rsquo;t understand the change they&rsquo;re being asked to make</li><li> Over one-third say they don&rsquo;t agree with it <br/>  </li><p> If the members of a company don&rsquo;t understand or agree with a change, that means there&rsquo;s a deep disconnect between that change and the culture. It could be that the change goes against the established values, or maybe the overarching vision just hasn&rsquo;t been communicated clearly.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t get misled by early success. For the change to actually last, employees need to stay committed even when it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;done&rdquo; and no longer a top priority. On the other hand, values are permanent.  <a href=\"http://jab.sagepub.com/content/38/4/436.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   If the change doesn&rsquo;t mesh with them, the change won&rsquo;t stick around  </u>  . </a>  You can push and pull with temporary pressure or rewards, but that progress has to be reinforced by the culture to truly become a part of your organization.</p><h3> Leading Organizational Change</h3><p> <br/> Use leadership to help your employees navigate major changes. A leader who lives a company&rsquo;s values and truly embraces its culture can demonstrate how the new direction is in line with the organization&rsquo;s identity. And having a manager who acts as a role model is tied to success: according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://eaglehillconsulting.com/opinions/across-generations-change-change-people-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Eagle Hill Consulting  </a> </u> , employees who were happier after change had one 94% of the time.</p><p> Employees are in desperate need of leaders who will see them through change initiatives. Look at what else Eagle Hill&rsquo;s survey found:</p><li> 82% of executives said they were committed to change &mdash; but only 66% of employees agreed that was true</li><li> 63% of executives said change was communicated well by the company ... but 65% of employees felt differently</li><li> There is a massive misalignment between those at the top and those left to institute the change at lower levels</li><h3> Tips and Tricks for Success</h3><p> <br/> Intimidated? You don&rsquo;t have to be. Here are 10 quick and easy tips to effectively lay a foundation for successful change:</p><p> <strong>  1. Clearly state your vision for the future </strong></p><p> Teams are more likely to embrace change when they are aware of what is happening and when. Don&rsquo;t create a culture of secrecy. Instead, be transparent and frequently communicate your vision so everyone is on the same page.</p><p> <strong>  2. Set short-term goals </strong></p><p> It is much easier to focus on goals and tasks that can be achieved in the immediate future than the end result that&rsquo;s years away. Introduce change in bite-size chunks that are achievable and manageable.</p><p> <strong>  3. Start at the top </strong></p><p> Employees will look to the CEO and C-level for support and direction. Ensure leadership buy-in and make sure they are a unified front.</p><p> <strong>  4. Ask employees what they think </strong></p><p> Make time to talk to the people on the ground to understand how they feel. You need to hear their needs, concerns, and fears to successfully implement something new. </p><p> <strong>  5. Stay on top of resistance </strong></p><p> Doing things differently will make some employees uncomfortable. Be aware of anyone who has a sudden negative attitude, and address any unhappiness or issues the moment they arise.</p><p> <strong>  6. Create new communication channels </strong></p><p> Your team will be hungry for information and updates, so beef up your steam of communication. Maintain visibility, be more accessible for impromptu conversations, and keep your employees regularly updated.</p><p> <strong>  7. Become an early adopter </strong></p><p> When you walk the walk, your employees will be more inspired to follow you. You will be seen as a role model adapting to this change rather than someone telling everyone else what to do.</p><p> <strong>  8. Keep a positive attitude </strong></p><p> Change can be stressful and confusing, but you can keep the corporate climate positive by remaining upbeat and enthusiastic.</p><p> <strong>  9. Give frequent feedback </strong></p><p> Personal, immediate feedback can be very motivating as employees&rsquo; jobs and culture change. Build their confidence and shape expectations by providing real-time feedback.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  How would you like to pay? </strong> <br/> Product development in today&rsquo;s reality looks beyond function and towards imagination. How do we create a new kind of digital teller that has access to vast and unlimited financial expertise, available anytime and for every customer? How do we provide increasingly effortless access to private information while ensuring near-absolute security? How do we make banking feel human while integrating advanced automation? These are the questions that the market leaders must answer with inventive and effective experiences.</p><p> The future we were promised is here &mdash; and it&rsquo;s better than flying cars. Thinking machines are driving an entirely new kind of economy, combined with machine vision, the future is poised to drive an entirely new kind of car. We learned from agro-tech how to take inventory-tracking capabilities from cattle-management and logistics into sophisticated wearables that have given innovators the ability to connect more deeply and intimately than ever before. The convergence of rapidly emerging technology is shaping a needs-driven reality where people and machines interface through natural conversations and connectivity make anywhere, anytime table-stakes.</p><p> <strong>  Keep the change </strong> <br/> There is an entirely new benchmark for transactional simplicity and customer service. The Credit Card is an incredibly simple piece of reliable technology that has a nearly perfect track record. Incremental innovation has ensured a highly secure and dynamic payment system, but disruptors are changing the pace of change. American Express innovated the brand and material experience, introducing high-quality materials and colors that make the token more attractive, leveraging the power of their brand to stand apart from competitors. The race to digital payments will be won and lost in terms of transactional simplicity. Banks must focus on digital products with the ease and reliability of the credit card, ignoring that will lead to trendy solutions that don&rsquo;t address the core of the customer perspective.</p><p> <strong>  Investing in the future </strong> <br/> The winners of the next generation will create experience-products that attract Millennials and Digital Natives through pure-digital, sophisticated mobile touch points while focusing on simplification. Venmo, Square and Bitcoin aren&rsquo;t winning on parlor tricks and interfaces &mdash; they are leveraging massively powerful platforms and democratizing the concept of currency. Your customer of the future is never going to set foot into your bank, they won&rsquo;t understand the concept of a check and the idea of speaking with a representative, interacting with a teller will be as foreign as a telephone booth.</p><p> Financial Services has led the charge in experiential technology for the past 20 years and understands the costly application of technology without purpose. To demonstrate what this means in terms of customer experience we&rsquo;ve been playing around with the idea of &ldquo;the curve of terrible experience.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s our own playful take on the digital industry&rsquo;s past, present, and future:</p> <img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5QN6oOtrPelFqm_t20rOEw.png\"/>The Curve Of Terrible Experience<p> <br/> <strong>  What&rsquo;s next? </strong> <br/> Clearly, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of industry growth in technology and maturity over the last 15 years &mdash; growth that drove new ways to engage with digital content but had no real consideration for the user. But everything changed with the rise of experiential design and experience design practices; suddenly, customer experience became top of mind for decision makers.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s what it takes to get there: </strong></p><li> It&rsquo;s not about what you can invent, it&rsquo;s about what you can work with. Practical Innovation examines resources and technology to build upon your existing capabilities mitigating the risk of product development.</li><li> Integrate into platforms like Amazon&rsquo;s Echo and make checking my balance as easy as &ldquo;Alexa, what&rsquo;s my balance? Transfer $3000 from account 8091 to 6854 please.</li><li> Build product development teams that leverage creative technology and design firms to quickly prototype and test potential products while mitigating risk</li><li> Create digital tools that show, not tell and help people make decisions not ask more questions. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  AI is a tangible customer engagement tool </strong></p><li> Leverage emerging platforms like IBM&rsquo;s Bluemix to create cognitive applications that provide insight, not just access</li><li> Integrate intelligence to augment customer support and create a new kind of digital banking expert</li><li> Help customers make better decisions and mitigate complexity for every decision</li><li> Make every interaction feel surprisingly human while acting efficiently digital. <br/>  </li><p> As we use imaginative ways to continually improve the customer experience, we need to consider these points.</p><p> <strong>  Make the intangible tangible. </strong> Successful digital experiences are authentic. As the real and digital world begin to look more and more alike, consumers will cling to consistency and authenticity in branding. The further a brand extends on either side of the boundary, the stronger it is. That means we need an authentic style, tone, voice, and experience &mdash; regardless of when, where, and how consumers interact with our brands.</p><p> <strong>  Tap into the technology toolbox. </strong> Connect physical interactions to digital profiles to better understand customers. Using sensors, beacons, analytics, and locations, we can gain an important understanding of the hyper-local context of each transaction and create valuable context. Taking advantage of customer information in ways that simplify any experience and bring value to every interaction. ATMs that wish customers happy birthday are parlor tricks and not worth the money and time invested. Think about how else that same data point, plus rewards, plus needs could result in a transaction that&rsquo;s authentic to the brand and valuable for the customer. Similarly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming the sentinel, preventing brands from co-opting customers into data-entry workers. Every time a customer navigates the complexities of a system, works to find an account summary, or authorizes a transfer &mdash; they become an unpaid worker. This is a reality being realized by consumers worldwide, and it is affecting brand sentiment. AI is becoming a natural language interface that translates needs, wants and desires into complex commands that machines can understand and humans need not be bothered with.</p><p> For example, Amazon&rsquo;s Echo instantly becomes an integrated part of people&rsquo;s lives. A cloud-based AI driven by artificial intelligence and natural language, Alexa personifies the Amazon brand and is surprisingly human. Financial services should be asking the same question &mdash; &ldquo;how do we leverage the practicality of AI and invisible interfaces to enhance how humans experience our products and services?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Embrace the new normal. </strong> We don&rsquo;t need to open our computer, type an address, search for a product, and suffer through a lengthy checkout process. We just say, &ldquo;Alexa, buy some apples.&rdquo; When we go to the supermarket, we don&rsquo;t fill out forms or use interfaces to find apples, so why should we do that in a digital marketplace? Shifting into this posture isn&rsquo;t a choice; it&rsquo;s a necessity. At its core, Alexa simplifies the experience of shopping down to simple voice commands. The opportunity is even greater for Financial Services as there&rsquo;s no clear winner in the simplification category. Redesigned interfaces and streamlined logins are table stakes. Redefining how transactions occur and feel is the opportunity.</p><p> <strong>  Bring technology to the table as designers, not engineers. </strong> By empowering technology to contribute to the solution we can explore aspects of security, navigating personal information and take advantage of the ideas that are generated from close contact to the systems that drive the machine. Bridging the space between business strategy, technology, and creative gives your firm the same posture and tools that today&rsquo;s startups use to move fast and iterate quickly.</p><p> <strong>  Be imaginative. </strong> Anyone who tells me the digital age takes away from creativity and imagination clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand the empowering nature of technology. New interfaces allow us to personify the consumer experience in increasingly customized ways &mdash; we need to use our imagination to capitalize on this.</p><p> Three years ago, we started a company to change the way surfboards are designed and built. Surfboards, after all, are like suits &mdash; they must be tailored to our bodies. We had to create a connection across the digital and physical boundaries, and we did it with a combination of personal profile data, sensor-based telematics, and a digital customer experience that focused on the emotional qualities of a surf lifestyle. The key to success was simplifying a confusing market with too many product choices with too few discernable differences. Our platform takes what it knows about the environment and your expertise and helps you choose products that will bring you more joy.</p><p> Financial products are complex, abstract and confusing &mdash; helping customers understand the effect of their decisions is critical. Acorns approached financial services in the same way we approached surfboard design. They created a highly gestural mobile investing app that shows you what you need, not expects you to uncover what might be right for you. In essence they mitigate anxiety of the unknown and remove risk from the process. That&rsquo;s a big difference in how you approach product selection. Acorns created a rich visual environment that encourages the user to slide and play until they achieve the desired outcome. It tackles complex financial products in a way that connects cause and effect. It doesn&rsquo;t educate by telling, it demonstrates long-term impact and encourages exploration. Essentially it answers the question everyone is asking: &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t have a bias, it instantly earns trust and it is a consistently branded experience. Hold experiences like Echo and Acorns to your current state to experience the same measure that your customers use.</p><p> <strong>  Lose the Big Brother mentality. </strong> Predictive experiences are powerful mechanisms for creating surprising moments that leave real impressions. Yet there&rsquo;s still a lingering sense that predictive experiences somehow invade individual privacy and diminish the customer experience. That&rsquo;s not true. Privacy is a balance and when there&rsquo;s a benefit of sharing information, people are happy to do so. Our world is moving toward intelligent experiences that will make interfaces invisible and interactions as simple as saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;buy.&rdquo;</p><p> As digital and physical worlds meld together, we must create customer interactions that encourage communication across boundaries. The more invisible the experience becomes, the more disbelief is suspended. It&rsquo;s not about marketing, descriptions, or details &mdash; it&rsquo;s about absolute immersion. It&rsquo;s what technology is enabling, and it&rsquo;s what customers demand.</p><p> <strong>  Experiment: </strong> Nothing replaces experimentation. It&rsquo;s the loudly beating heart of possibility and it&rsquo;s the greatest motivator you can give your teams. Explore technology, explore experiential and explore new channels. Talk directly to your audience through Periscope, open up your monthly meetings to your customers, blend office space into the retail banking space and have officers working in the middle of it all. Why should operations be out of view? Unless you&rsquo;re Disney, the magic isn&rsquo;t what drives them through the door. Take risks that are measurable, reasonable and worthwhile.</p><p> The future of financial services is simple, intelligent and invisible. Combining new and existing technology like Artificial Intelligence, sensors and mobile provides banks with the ability to create new convenience-based revenue opportunities that enhance the Innovation Quotient of the product and keep customers engaged. Technology is becoming friendlier and invites leaders from across the organization to collaborate, extending beyond the office of the CTO &mdash; which benefits the brand and the product offering. The key questions continue to be driven by customer needs:</p><li> How do we design predictive data-driven products based on data, not reactive tactics?</li><li> How do we communicate the value, not describe the benefits of our products?</li><li> How do we create a collaborative design driven democracy within our firm around design thinking and innovation practices? <br/>  </li><p> Leadership must be aligned on the answers to these questions and drive the practices and product innovation required to keep banks competitive and offerings relevant. Design firms, creative technologists and in-house talent can guide and nurture these activities, enhancing the value of the firm and everything it produces. The rise of rapid prototyping tools and the maturation of digital product development give organizations the ability to develop experience products that define state of the art, ensuring a competitive position in an ever-advancing field.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I can&rsquo;t find it online but I was just in a session at <u>  BAI RD2015 </u>  where the BAI research guys put up some slides on access preferences.  They called these &ldquo;channel preferences&rdquo;, as do most, but I cannot use the word channel without physically retching.  It&rsquo;s a great way to bring on bulimia but, apart from that, I&rsquo;d rather use the word access.</p><p> So the figures showed the preferences today and in three years (2018).  Today, the #1 choice is online (as in laptop/desktop).  Then it&rsquo;s branch, ATM, mobile (and tablet), drive through and, finally, talking to a human on the phone.  By 2018, the picture changes to #1 still being online (really?), and then mobile (yay!), branch (still?), ATM (you still need cash dontcha?), drive through and call centre.</p><p> There was then some discussion about old folks versus young folks, and so this slide was thrown up (sorry, did someone say  channel  again?):</p><br /><p> This is showing that millennials are all mobile-centric whilst non-millennials (old farts?) are more online and branch focused.  Maybe, but I feel we need to think of this differently.  The truth be told we have digital people, digital-analogue people and analogue people.</p><p> These three are not defined by age, ethnicity, religion or sexual preference but more by wealth, education, outlook and needs.  We need a new demographic for the psychographic age.</p><p> For example, I connect with a lot of people who are very comfortable with digital and being mobile first, including some over the age of 60.  My mother is far more comfortable emailing and facebook commentating as a relationship than calling me on the phone, and she&rsquo;s slightly older than the normal digital demographic as am I.</p><p> However, I would say that I&rsquo;m a digital person &ndash; I&rsquo;m immersed in this world &ndash; whilst she is a digital-analogue person, as she loves being online but not mobile online.  Meanwhile, there are a range of people who don&rsquo;t want to do anything with money on the internet as they don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s secure, and these are analogue people.  Analogue people love branches where they can chat with Mary the Teller who they&rsquo;ve known since their first account opening.</p><p> Fairy snuff.</p><p> But let&rsquo;s extrapolate this out a bit more.  Who is the analogue person?  Yes, they probably are older or, if younger, they are likely to be less educated, less wealthy and less invested online.  The digital-analogues like the fact that they can go into the branch to smell the money, even though the money is no longer there.  The digitals just don&rsquo;t care, and would rather do everything through an app or, even better, a tap on their wearable.  These latter two categories are likely to be more educated, wealthy and invested online.</p><p> The problem with this is that the analogue world is therefore left serving the less profitable whilst the digital world serves the mass affluent.  What does that mean over time?  The analogues get charged for using analogue services.  Oh dear.  These are the people who can&rsquo;t afford those services, so eventually the most likely scenario is that they get shunted off to the Post Office to get served, as the Post Office is happy to process their analogue transactions for $1 a time.</p><p> Now that may sound like a sad world, but another thing will probably happen as a result.  As the underserved analogue people realise they&rsquo;re being screwed for using analogue services, they&rsquo;ll switch.  But what they switch to is the question.  After all, if mobile wallets can enable 1 in 4 people in Africa to exchange value in real-time, won&rsquo;t it do the same for analogue Europeans and Americans?  Just a thought &hellip;</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you run anything from a two-person team to a large organization, \"doing more with less\" isn't just an annoying clich&eacute;; it's reality. Until AI's and robots are running the world, we humans are called upon to be ever more scalable, which boils down to three related themes:</p><p> 1) Increasing your workload capacity without giving up more of your life </p><p> 2) Enhancing your time management (e.g., meetings, emails, work time, think time)</p><p> 3) Improving the quality of your output, product, service, and/or outcomes</p><p> These scalability improvements often need to happen during tough times. Almost everyone faces challenges with recruiting, administration, expense and revenue pressures, etc. Yet these are often the times enhancing scalability can make the difference between surviving and thriving. </p><h3> Here's What Works</h3><p> <br/> If you're anything like my coaching clients, you're wondering, \"Okay, so now what?\" Here are three levers that I've repeatedly found help people upgrade their scalability. </p><p> 1.  Recruit/retain high capability/capacity/potential people, eliminate hurdles in their way, and let them run</p><p> Select and retain people who care a lot about what they do, the quality with which they do it, their ability to work without heavy supervision, and good attitudes about helping each other.  Have the courage to look at your people through this lens, and, after giving reasonable support and opportunities, eliminate those who fall short without undue delay.</p><p> Once you have the right person, let them run&mdash;give them responsibility and authority.  Look at what you&rsquo;re holding on to doing yourself and/or micromanaging  what they&rsquo;re doing, and offload offload offload to them.  Create good ways for them to keep you updated on the important things and implement/enhance your standards about when you need to be involved versus informed.</p><p> Ask and listen to your key people regularly regarding: 1) their workload in relation to their capacity, 2) their ability to prioritize quality over quantity, 3) their willingness/capacity to help out their colleagues, and 4) what hurdles you can remove that are getting in their way.  Failure to do this is a failure of leadership; so if it&rsquo;s been a while, you may want to try it with a few of your people and see what you learn.</p><p> 2.  Discern when a great idea is distraction rather than a great addition, without missing the next big thing</p><p> It&rsquo;s way easier to come up with great ideas than to discern whether or not it&rsquo;s worthwhile to do them. Many of my clients are faced every week with a truckload of shiny new ones that sound like, &ldquo;We should be doing that,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t we doing that?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if we could&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;We need to take a look at that,&rdquo; and &ldquo;They&rsquo;re doing that, so shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p> Great people want to do it all and are inclined to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; too often. Yet there&rsquo;s already a vision and roadmap ongoing, thank you very much.  Yessing too much creates churn, confusion, role/responsibility fuzziness and an inability to deliver on priorities.  After all, if you take on everything you&rsquo;ll get nothing done and distract everyone.  Take on nothing and you miss the next big thing, or at least risk getting out of date with what clients, customers, or constituents need or want.</p><p> I recommend my clients consider three standards when the next idea or fire drill shows up:</p><li> Discovery without derailment: Can this idea be evaluated for return on investment or expectations without derailing the current path?</li><li> Steadfastness of vision and roadmap: If your vision and roadmap are solid, is there a compelling reason to add this to it?</li><li> Openness to changing the game: Regardless of the above, is this idea likely in a relevant timeframe to change the game, and therefore do we need to change our vision and roadmap? <br/>  </li><p> If the result of those standards is not to pursue an idea, no matter how compelling, it&rsquo;s necessary to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in ways the right people can absorb, which, ironically, is usually &ldquo;Yes, and&hellip;&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what we would have to stop doing or cut back on if we did it.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s often easier than &ldquo;No&rdquo; to something that seems or sounds fabulous.</p><p> 3.  Own your calendar and time, rather than be owned by them</p><p> I ask my clients to, 1) add modest blocks of sacred (i.e., non-changeable) time to their calendar daily or several times a week to think and reflect, 2) define when, outside of work, they will do work, and stick with it, 3) identify a handful of priorities each week, and stick with them, and 4) stop letting things get added to their calendar without passing a few tests:</p><li> Will your participation in this add value to your current highest priorities, those of a colleague, and/or those of the organization overall?</li><li> Is it something that can be done virtually rather than take up a chunk of time?</li><li> Will it speed up, slow down, or have a neutral impact to the current vision and/or roadmap?</li>",

This article is not about low-cost beta ETF roboadvisors (<u> <a href=\"http://www.betterment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Betterment </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.wealthfront.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Wealthfront </a></u>), or private-label RIA robos (<u> <a href=\"http://www.vanare.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Vanare | NestEgg </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.trizic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Trizic </a></u>). It is not about data aggregation companies (<u> <a href=\"http://byallaccounts.morningstar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ByAllAccounts </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.yodlee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yodlee </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.quovo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quovo </a></u>), beautiful client portals (<u> <a href=\"http://www.wealthaccess.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Wealth Access </a></u>) or web-based financial planning (<u> <a href=\"http://www.advizr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Advizr </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.wealthminder.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Wealthminder </a></u>). No.<p> We won&rsquo;t talk about those things because they already happened. The industry has already changed, and trillions of next-gen assets are on the move. If you&rsquo;re an RIA and looking to solve this, give me a shout on  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LexSokolin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u> .</p><p> So now, let&rsquo;s talk about the future.</p><h3> 1. Blockchain and Open-Source Data</h3><p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bitcoin  </u> </a>  is famous for its volatility as a currency. What is not as well advertised is its unique technological infrastructure. Bitcoin and other digital currencies use a system called the  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blockchain  </u>    </a> comprised of a public ledger of all transactions, shared between every participant in the system.</p><p> This infrastructure can be used for  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Alternative_chain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   much more  </a> </u>  than digital cash &mdash; it can drive trusted and secure authentication, contracting, financial data, and private transactions. Most importantly, it can provide accuracy and verification of sensitive data without a need for a centralized financial institution or government.</p>Think of thousands of robots wearing green eye shades, all checking each other&rsquo;s accounting. Individually the robots (or their owners) are not very trustworthy, but collectively, coordinated by mathematics, they produce results of high reliability and security. (Quote from &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-computing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Dawn of Trustworthy Computing </a></u>&rdquo;,<u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo\" target=\"_blank\">  Nick Szabo </a></u>)<p> The Blockchain will remove the need for a &ldquo;stamp of approval&rdquo; from large financial institutions, while allowing clients to trust and store their data securely in the cloud.</p><h3> 2. Wearable Computing</h3><p> In the 1970s, governments and large corporations were the only ones to afford computers, housing enormous mainframes in their offices. By the 1990s, thanks to Apple and Microsoft, every household had a personal computer. Today, every individual owns multiple large and small computing devices, from their home and work desktops, to tablets and phones.</p><p> Just around the corner is the ubiquitous integration of smart computing into every day items. This trend, called wearable computing, has already been implemented for  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\" target=\"_blank\">   glasses  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/gallery/the-complete-guide-to-wearable-jewelry/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   jewelry  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/watch/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   watches  </a> </u> . The devices are revolutionary in both their collection and communication of data. Bio-signs, like heart rate, can be measured and stored. Embedded video cameras can record every moment of life, and save them to a private, secure database. GPS can map out every step of our daily work and leisure.</p><p> Our senses will be augmented to be far more lasting and persistent than ever before. The data generated by all these devices can be shared at will, and used by financial institutions to create a holistic picture of clients that will be truly unprecedented.</p><p> Authentication will also be easier than ever before. As implemented by  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple Pay  </a> </u> , a tap of the thumb to a small computing device is faster and more secure than any paper signature process the advisory industry has in place today.</p><h3> 3. Image Recognition</h3><p> Not only can technology collect what we experience, but it can now learn and describe what we see. Just recently,  <u>  <a href=\"https://photos.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Photos  </a> </u>  launched with unlimited photo storage. By uploading your library to the service, the user (1) makes it accessible across all devices with an installed app, and (2) allows image recognition software to comb through and categorize all the images.</p><p> The results are uncanny.</p><p> The software reads faces of people in the photos, and can identify and tag them across ages. From adolescence to retirement, the machine knows who you are. It can also find and understand objects and environments, presenting neatly every sunset ever photographed.</p><p> Here is the implication for financial services: every individual that allows algorithms to categorize their images will, as a byproduct, create a full graph of expressed preferences that are true and accurate in a way that no risk questionnaire can hope to capture.</p><p> An advisor can learn if their client is a cat- or dog-person, whether they like to travel or build up their home, how many children they have and  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/04/30/microsoft-photo-age-detection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what age they are  </a> </u> . Software can impute risk tolerance and capacity for risk taking. It can prompt the opening of a 529 Plan after noticing a photograph of a newborn baby. And the technology works already. The next step is to combine this type of data with a privacy and security layer (e.g., Blockchain) that protects information, and generates value for both client and advisor when shared.</p><h3> 4. Semantic Analysis of Social Media</h3><p> In addition to the preference graph generated through images, we already have the ability to create personality profiles based on a social media presence. One example is  <u>  Five Labs </u> , which uses  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   semantic analysis  </u>    </a> and  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\" target=\"_blank\">   natural language processing  </a> </u>  to understand what people mean when they says things to each other on the internet.</p><p> Another provider of this analysis is IBM Watson, a supercomputer with deep <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  machine learning </a>  capabilities. Watson unearths an even deeper behavioral profile, called  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/personality-insights/?mhq=personality%20insights&amp;mhsrc=ibmsearch_a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Personality Insights  </u>  , </a>  priced at just $0.60 per API request.</p><p> It is incredible that many of the tools and technologies to run such a complex analysis are already Open Source, meaning they are available for anyone to grow and modify. The input text, whether on Facebook, Twitter or other social media, can be parsed into sentences and intended meanings, and then can associated with broader topics, moods, and personal attributes. This technology makes the financial advisor&rsquo;s paper Risk Profile Questionnaire woefully antiquated as a result.</p><h3> 5. Financial APIs</h3><p> None of this data (&ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data\" target=\"_blank\">   Big Data  </a> </u> &rdquo;) is useful unless our super-powerful computers can talk to each other. That is where  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\" target=\"_blank\">  APIs </a>  come in. APIs allow developers to build applications that connect one complex, messy data set to another using a standardized format.</p><p> Companies like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.plaid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Plaid  </a> </u>  are working to liberate financial data from the centralized legacy systems of our major financial institutions. The prior decade&rsquo;s data aggregation firms have made it possible to see all of a client&rsquo;s transaction in a single place. These new API services will make it possible to actually use that data within other applications.</p><p> Plaid is embedded into multiple Roboadvisors to authenticate ACH transfers in seconds, rather than several days. Other companies like  <u>  <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stripe  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Braintree  </a> </u>  enable developers to program online payments into their applications. For example, Uber uses Braintree in its application to create a seamless checkout experience.</p><p> Using such APIs, we can build algorithms tied to a user&rsquo;s Facebook or Google identity that combines a financial Income Statement &amp; Balance Sheet (detailed transactions across multiple banks), a behavioral profile based on social communication patterns, and a personality profile based on imaging data.</p><p> These can then be used in a predictive way to understand what financial products the client is going to need in the future, similar to how Google can predict what a user is about to search. Financial accounts can be opened online, authenticated personal data transferred seamlessly, with funding and trading occurring in mere seconds thereafter.</p><h3> 6. Digitization of Cash and Securities</h3><p> Next up is the actual investment. Already, we have secure digital cash and wallets via Bitcoin and its sisters ( <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/investing/cryptocurrency-alternatives-to-bitcoin-1.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   LiteCoin  </u>  , DogeCoin, etc. </a> ). Whether such currencies move from a $4 billion market capitalization to full ubiquity remains to be seen. More interesting is the idea that the US Dollar itself could become fully digital. What if the Federal Reserve adopted and approved a Blockchain-type ledger for the expansion of a digital USD?</p><p> Digital dollars matter because they can be divided into tiny, tiny fractions that allow for microtransactions. This would usher in a new age of online commerce: imagine 5 million underbanked clients being able to pay their financial mentors 0.25% on $150.00.</p><p> Now what about securities? A digital version of a stock or ETF could be divisible infinitesimal pieces.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.stockpile.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stockpile, a stock gifting start-up  </a> </u> , has already built the fractional security transfer technology. As a result, the newborn with the aforementioned 529 Plan can have a sophisticated-quality global asset allocation with just $0.25 in her account. Account minimums be gone!</p><h3> 7. Community-Driven Investing</h3><p> Have you heard of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.quantopian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quantopian  </a> </u> ?</p><p> Quantopian is a crowd-sourced hedge fund that provides the world&rsquo;s first browser-based algorithmic trading platform. On our platform, you can write code to execute your investment strategies, instead of relying on manual trades and emotional urges.</p><p> How about  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/how-it-works/benefits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Motif Investing  </a> </u> ?</p><p> With motifs, your investments reflect your views. Explore the catalog of 150+ professionally built motifs and 130,000+ motifs created and customized by our community.</p>But certainly a community approach to selecting the best investment manager works only for publicly available securities? Can it ever apply to hedge funds or private equity? Actually, it already does. See <u> <a href=\"https://angel.co/help/syndicates?ref=how-it-works#how-syndicates-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AngelList Syndicates </a></u>.A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor&rsquo;s deals. Investors can also invest as little as $1K. Leads get carry for their investments. Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment.These online algorithms compete with the beta-only Roboadvisors and serve investors of all investment personalities &mdash; from Vanguard Bogleheads to return-chasing day traders. Such investment technology will inevitably become freely available and open the industry&rsquo;s Pandora&rsquo;s Box. Already, there are open source <u> <a href=\"http://wealthbot.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Roboadvisor </a></u> code repositories and <u> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=0CFwQFjAJahUKEwiRnKGpx53HAhXBXB4KHebeAI4&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1999-4893%2F6%2F1%2F169%2Fpdf&amp;ei=UhjIVZGrPMG5eea9g_AI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFofX2bjUlvrNUBtCHvbTpqHkE52g&amp;sig2=F-Bl8kSxhe7ePCh6QanU3w&amp;bvm=bv.99804247,d.dmo&amp;cad=rja\" target=\"_blank\">  Black-Litterman optimization </a></u> white papers.All that remains is to create a trustworthy, distributed community where an investor selects the best algorithm for their financial situation and personality in a secure environment. Accounts open, data flows, and fees are digitally paid. The back office is on autopilot.<h3> 8. Brand as Currency</h3>What is the role of a financial advisor in a future world accelerated by technology? The short answer is that the advisor&rsquo;s role will continue to be a client&rsquo;s mentor, counselor and guide through the complex financial landscape. The advisor will generate and reinforce Trust and Brand, building relationships that align investors with online products and algorithms.In a <u> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sokolin/investing-in-the-age-of-millennials-beyond-robots-and-replicants-5991a2f0ec5e\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  prior article </a></u>, I suggested that advisors will receive a new type of credential: Behavioral Financial Therapy (&ldquo;BFT&rdquo;). The best BFT on the market today is without question <u> <a href=\"http://www.behaviorgap.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Carl Richards of Behavioral Gap </a></u>. His unrivaled ability to communicate complex ideas simply and create confidence has allowed Carl to reach an audience of millions through asset managers like the <u> <a href=\"http://thebamalliance.com/blog/tag/behavior-gap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BAM Alliance </a></u> and publications like the <u> New York Times</u>.Such good advisors will be voted up (while poor ones will be voted down) on a website like <u> Reddit</u> or <u> <a href=\"http://www.producthunt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Product Hunt </a></u>. With the benefit of automation and technology, this trusted advisor will manage not 50 clients, but 5,000 or 500,000. They will be paid with either digital cash, or additional social currency &mdash; referrals will be quantified and measured. Already today, you can get <u> <a href=\"http://www.paywithatweet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  paid with a Tweet </a></u>.<h3> <strong>  So what should an advisor do? </strong></h3><strong> These 8 technology trends are a fundamental transformation of our industry. The current focus on Roboadvisors is a mere symptom of much larger things to come.</strong>Advisors should spend the time now to deeply analyze their practice and goals:<li> Are you building a lasting enterprise or maintaining a set of relationships? The answer will determine how rapidly you should adopt new technologies.</li><li> Do you prefer spending time on investment selection or client acquisition? Specialization on the true value-add of your practice is a necessary byproduct of ever more software in the industry.</li><li> What is your investment philosophy, and how do you implement it? Different technology choices are appropriate for active/passive approaches and different investment vehicles (stocks, ETFs, SMAs).</li><li> How do clients think about technology and would they benefit from innovative but experimental approaches to communication? Age may be responsible for differing opinions, but respect the early adopters!</li><h3> <strong>  That&rsquo;s a lot of work for us to do. Let&rsquo;s get to it. </strong></h3>  ",

    "content": "<p> Think about the last major decision in your life. Maybe you bought a new house, or a new car. Maybe you decided to shift your career into a new direction. Or maybe you started a new relationship.</p><h3> Now, just for a moment, think about how you made that decision.</h3><p> <br/> Did you rationally go through all the pros and cons? Weigh all your options carefully? Develop a scoring grid to help you see which option would be best for you?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re honest with yourself, and if you&rsquo;re anything like me (and 99% of all people) chances are the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Chances are that, just like the rest of us, you made most of those decisions primarily based on emotions &ndash; not rational logic.</p><p> Where we try to trick ourselves into thinking that we behave rationally, there is ample research out there that shows us otherwise. In  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/decisive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Decisive&rdquo; by Chip and Dan Heath  </u> </a> , the authors point out the &ldquo;four villains&rdquo; when it comes to making decisions:</p><li> <strong>  We have too narrow of focus.  </strong> We are guilty of &ldquo;spotlight thinking.&rdquo; We focus on the obvious and visible. We miss important facts outside our immediate view.</li><li> <strong>  We fall into confirmation bias.  </strong> We develop a quick belief about something and then seek out information that confirms that belief.</li><li> <strong>  We get caught in short-term emotion.  </strong> We are too emotionally connected to the decision and struggle with being appropriately detached.</li><li> <strong>  We are guilty of overconfidence.  </strong> We assume that we know more than we actually do know and jump to conclusions, thinking we can accurately predict the future. <br/>  </li><p> Now let me ask you this: if you and I are both guilty of being caught up in short-term emotional factors, why would our clients be any different? Why would things somehow be different just because we put on a suit and tie and sit around the boardroom?</p><p> The biggest problem with understanding customer buying behaviour is this: we assume it&rsquo;s mostly rational. It&rsquo;s not.</p><p> People make decisions for all sorts of reasons, and logic tends to be pretty far down the list. Personally, I recommend looking at decision-making as involving four main dimensions &ndash; think of these as lines on a four-box grid, and you&rsquo;ll get the picture.</p><h3> Rational/Emotional</h3><p> <br/> In reality, even though the emotional factors outweigh the rational ones, we still use both our decision-making process. Emotional factors in business-to-business buying include things like the level of liking you have for a particular vendor salesperson, how attractive or prestigious their brand is to you and whether or not to have a strong relationship with an influencer and thought leader inside your firm.</p><p> Rational factors include things like the return on investment (ROI), business case and objective measurements of performance.</p><p> Note that in rational factors, I did not include things like &ldquo;scoring grid&rdquo;. Even though at first glance it seems objective, the scoring grid still reflects the individual preferences (and emotions) of the people that contributed to it.</p><h3> Personal/Collective</h3><p> <br/> The second dimension to consider in understanding customer buying behaviour is whether a decision impacts the personal and/or collective. Personal factors tend to focus on the individual, mostly answering the question &ldquo;What&rsquo;s In It For Me?&rdquo; &ndash; things like impact on personal career progression, how failure might impact a buyer&rsquo;s position within the firm and how a particular choice might impact their long-term options.</p><p> Collective factors focus on the firm itself &ndash; how a particular purchase will benefit its employees, shareholders, management, leadership, board, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.</p><p> In B2B sales, we tend to focus almost exclusively on collective factors &ndash; it&rsquo;s what we discuss in meeting rooms and include in our proposals &ndash; to the exclusion of the personal. Yet, as research has shown,  <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/the-6-buyer-personas-and-how-to-sell-to-them/?__hstc=74853325.0b7654a79c872482edc779dbbe714bf9.1444235129425.1444843006675.1444855648894.4&amp;__hssc=74853325.1.1444855648894&amp;__hsfp=1864651773\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  personal factors and preferences </a>  tend to have a disproportionate influence on the sales process at particular key moments, often clearly swaying a decision towards one vendor versus another.</p><p> In their sales efforts, most sellers focus almost exclusively on two dimensions: the rational, and the collective. A disproportionate amount of time is spent on understanding, addressing and winning in those areas &ndash; often at the cost of virtually completely ignoring the other two.</p><p> Yet, research and my own experience clearly show that decisions are not only &ndash; not even primarily &ndash; made according to those criteria.</p><p> If you want to get better at understanding customer behavior, make sure you cover the emotional and personal dimensions as well. Here are a few questions to help you do just that.</p><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Imagine this project were successful, how do you think that might benefit you personally?&rdquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;At this point &ndash; if I asked you straight out &ndash; how are we doing so far?&rdquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;How do you think management would evaluate the success of this initiative?&rdquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;At this point, how do you feel about the possibility of working together on this?&rdquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Off the record &ndash; what&rsquo;s your worst fear or concern about this right now?&rdquo; </strong> <br/>  </li><p> When asking questions like the ones above, it often helps to start by introducing something called a &ldquo;softening statement&rdquo; &ndash; a short statement that prefaces your question, and &ldquo;softens it&rdquo; is not seen as abrasive or overly direct. Examples of softening statements include &ldquo;I was wondering&rdquo;, &ldquo;Could I ask &hellip;?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wanted to get your thoughts on something&rdquo;.</p><p> Many sellers are fearful of discussing personal and/or emotional factors in the sales conversation &ndash; we&rsquo;ve all been taught that there is a clear division between the personal realm and the professional.</p><p> Nothing could be further from the truth: as a former manager and executive with three Fortune-100 corporations, I can tell you that the vast majority of all decision-making is highly emotionally charged, and fuelled by competing and/or aligned personal agendas. If you want to get better at understanding customer buying behaviour, the first step is to develop a broader perspective, thinking across the four dimensions of decision-making: rational/emotional and personal/collective.</p>",

    "title": "5 Time Management Secrets to Teach Your Employees",
    "link": "5-time-management-secrets-to-teach-your-employees",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Time. We all wish we had more of it. Yet no matter how hard we try to conserve it, it seems to slip away from us in drips and drabs.</p><p> This is especially concerning if you&rsquo;re in charge of a team of people responsible for ensuring your business runs smoothly and efficiently. If you can help every team member become more effective, think how much time you&rsquo;ll save overall! Here are five time management secrets to teach today.</p><li> <h3>  <strong>   Shorten Those To-Do Lists   </strong> </h3></li><p> <br/> One of the biggest time sucks is the endless to-do list. Filled with small and often nonessential items, to-do lists are only useful if they serve the purpose of helping people be more productive. Teach team members easy way to shorten to-do lists, like getting rid of all items they&rsquo;ll do no matter what. Think &ldquo;check email&rdquo; or &ldquo;get lunch.&rdquo; Scratch easy tasks that don&rsquo;t need to happen right away; they often become tempting due to their simplicity, and end up taking precedence over harder but more crucial chores.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/prioritize-task-list-methods/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Belle Cooper recommends  </a> </u>  moving tasks that depend on other people somewhere else (to a follow-up list, for instance, or a shared project) so that you don&rsquo;t have to feel the nagging pressure of tasks you can&rsquo;t complete on your own. Teach your employees how to distinguish between tasks they can and should do right away, and those that should be filed somewhere else or ditched altogether.</p><li> <h3>  <strong>   Take Time to Be Creative   </strong> </h3></li><p> <br/> Creativity is crucial. It makes people feel happier, more productive and more in charge of their own work lives. It&rsquo;s an amazing way to give your workers a little freedom, boosting their brainpower and making them more efficient when they return to regular tasks. Of course, creativity must still fall within the scope of the job, but giving workers time to explore, read, create or invent can immeasurably improve attitude, moral and time effectiveness.</p><li> <h3>  <strong>   Create a System for Email  </strong> </h3></li><p> <br/> Ah, email. To reduce mental space and inbox space wasted by email, teach employees to deal with it right away. &ldquo;Inbox Zero&rdquo; should always be the goal, so read, reply or file instantly to reduce inbox clutter and improve efficiency.</p><li> <h3>  <strong>   Handle a Task Once, and Once Only   </strong> </h3></li><p> <br/> The &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/stop-leaving-tasks-half-finished-with-the-one-touch-ru-1626933101\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   One-Touch Rule  </a> </u> &rdquo; can significantly limit the amount of time employees spend waffling between tasks and feeling mentally burdened by chores that seem to haunt them forever. We all know that feeling of picking up and putting a task down so many times that it becomes a huge monkey on our backs.</p><p> Instead, teach employees to process each task as soon as it reaches them. If it&rsquo;s an email: read, reply or file. If it&rsquo;s a piece of paperwork, they should complete it, photocopy it or file it away. Whatever the task, when it comes across an employee&rsquo;s desk, they should know how to handle it immediately.</p><p> Note that some tasks can&rsquo;t be done at that moment, in which case processing it means filing it in the right place for later, then putting a date on the calendar for when it will be dealt with and how. Some tasks are also large, in which case processing can mean breaking the task into steps and waiting until there&rsquo;s enough time to complete them. Whatever the case, ignoring the task is the No. 1 time-wasting no-no, so offer better alternatives.</p><li> <h3>  <strong>   Have an End-Of-Day Routine   </strong> </h3></li><p> <br/> At the end of the day, teach each employee to create a short to-do list for the next, containing only the highest priority tasks, and unclutter their work space so it will be fresh and ready for the following day.</p><p> Time management doesn&rsquo;t need to feel impossible when you institute these tips in every worker&rsquo;s daily routine!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Today we have unprecedented access to information anywhere and anytime. We can multitask using multiple screens, and we can connect and converse on the fly&mdash;yet there are still only 24 hours in a day. Do you think that our increased level of &ldquo;connectedness&rdquo; today has anything to do with being busier, yet less productive? You bet it does, and I fall victim to this just as much as anyone else. In fact, I notice more and more these days that I need to &ldquo;unplug&rdquo; on a regular basis in order to regain some equilibrium. Do you notice that in your life as well? Here are a few tips I&rsquo;ve gleaned from personal experience that can help you stay productive without being overwhelmed with busy-ness:</p><h3> <strong>  Keep Track of Your Priorities </strong></h3><p> <br/> Writing down your goals and keeping them uppermost in your mind as you plan your schedule for the day, week, month or year is important. It&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed with everything that ends up on your plate&mdash;whether you put it there or someone else does. So when I start feeling that things are falling off the edge and I can&rsquo;t keep track of it all, I have to take a step back and look at those priorities again.</p><p> Does this activity or that one serve my goals or detract from them? Should I take on this assignment now or politely decline (or postpone)? When should I just say &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo;?</p><p> Ask yourself these questions as a filter as you go over your schedule. Make sure your assistant(s) have those priorities in front of them as well, so they can be proactive in protecting your time and keeping you on track.</p><h3> <strong>  Keep Your To-Do List Short (and give yourself a break) </strong></h3><p> <br/> How many things do you put on your daily &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list? If you&rsquo;re like many of us, it can be easy to pile things on as you go, and then beat yourself up because you didn&rsquo;t get it all done in a day. Life happens. Interruptions happen. Take those things into account and prioritize your to-do list into A, B and C activities. A = Must Get Done Today (or I&rsquo;ll lose business), B = Should Get Done Today (but can wait) and C = Would be Nice (but not necessary).</p><p> Then cull your list to one or two As (and maybe a B), but not more than three items total. Everything else can move to the next day and re-prioritized. Be honest with yourself on what&rsquo;s an A, B or C and match them to your priorities list.</p><p> Why only three items? Putting ten or more items on a daily to-do list sets you up for failure. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to get that many things done in the average work day, so you stress yourself out before you even start, and the tension builds throughout the day as you get further and further behind. Trust me, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to work from a short list. It keeps you more focused, and instead of beating yourself up because you only got one or two things done, you can celebrate instead! Those one or two things moved you toward your prioritized goals instead of keeping you spinning in a hamster wheel of busy-but-not-productive activities. It takes a little practice to get in a groove with this, but I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s well worth the effort.</p><h3> <strong>  Unplug to Recharge </strong></h3><p> <br/> Prioritizing your activities and keeping your to-do list short are important, but so is taking time for yourself to unplug and unwind. Today we&rsquo;re bombarded by more external stimuli than ever before. Multiple screens mean that multiple things vie for our limited attention spans. Our days are full to bursting. We get less sleep. All of that tends to pack on the stress, which has a direct effect on mental and physical health.</p><p> Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned to listen to my body&rsquo;s physical cues that it&rsquo;s time to unplug. One of those cues is when I have nothing on my plate the next day, but I wake up feeling stressed and drained. I might have even accomplished a lot the previous day (or week). When I get that feeling, I know it&rsquo;s time to take a few days to head to my favorite quiet beach and relax, take it down a notch (or two sometimes) and recharge my mental batteries.</p><p> Learn to pay attention to your own inner cues. It&rsquo;s important to find that balance for yourself, and to carve out time and space where you can get away even for a short while, even for &ldquo;moments&rdquo; at a time, to just &ldquo;be&rdquo; in an environment that makes you happy and gives you peace.</p><h3> <strong>  Rinse and Repeat </strong></h3><p> <br/> While it&rsquo;s important to unplug when necessary, it&rsquo;s also important not to lose your productivity momentum when getting back into your work routine. That&rsquo;s why I always re-start by revisiting and tweaking my written goals and making a concerted effort to keep my to-do lists short and prioritized. However, we&rsquo;re not robots, and life is not something that can be relegated to lists. Give yourself room to move, be flexible, and recognize moments of opportunity that give our lives meaning and purpose.</p><p> Is this outline a magic formula that works for everyone? Nope. I know that it works for me, but there might be other things that work for you. We&rsquo;re all busy&mdash;and each of us copes with that in different ways. But we&rsquo;re also human, which means we benefit from being on both the receiving and giving end of sharing what helps us live healthy, productive lives. Hopefully you can benefit in some way from the tips I&rsquo;ve shared here.</p><p> Remember I say all the time that there is #NoLetUp&hellip; but that also means #NoLetUp finding a few moments here and there for yourself.</p><p> This originally appeared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ted Rubin  </u> </a> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jhagel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Hagel  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.edgeperspectives.typepad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Edge Perspectives  </u> </a></p><h3> We humans are a paradoxical species. On the one hand, we are uniquely endowed with the power of extraordinary imagination &ndash; the ability to see what could be, but has never been. On the other hand, as humans, we are imperfect, we have weaknesses and we make mistakes, lots of them. It is the ability of our imagination to triumph over our imperfections, weaknesses and mistakes that has driven human progress over the millennia.</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s another paradox: the rise and spread of industrial society was at one level a product of that powerful imagination and yet that very same society has been on a quest to limit and contain that imagination. Our industrial society embraces scalable efficiency. It thrives on predictability and reliability and views imagination with some ambivalence &ndash; it drives innovation, but on the other hand undermines predictability and reliability.</p><p> As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, there&rsquo;s a third paradox: digital technology has intensified the quest for scalable efficiency and undermined our humanity while at the same time opening up the possibility of a new renaissance of the imagination that can help us to recapture our humanity.</p><h3> <strong>  Let me explain. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Digital technology indeed has a dark side &ndash; a dark side that is intrinsic to the technology. The dark side is mounting performance pressure that comes in three different forms &ndash; intensifying competition, accelerating pace of change and the increased likelihood of extreme events that disrupt our best laid plans and predictions. In part, these extreme events surface because we have turned over decision-making to our globally connected machines. For example, at least part of the increasing price volatility in stock markets is driven by automated trading that instantaneously responds to the latest event, without leaving any time for reflection. On the other hand, these extreme events also surface because global connectivity makes it far easier to scale initiatives than ever before, especially through the development of platform businesses that harness network effects.</p><p> We all are experiencing that mounting performance pressure as individuals and institutions. As examples of this mounting pressure, my analysis in the Shift Index shows that return on assets for all public companies in the United States has declined by 75 percent since 1965 and companies that manage to make it into the top quartile of ROA performance topple out of that position at an accelerating rate.</p><p> The dark side leads to very understandable human psychological reactions. We magnify perception of risk and discount perception of reward. We shorten our time horizons. We tend to adopt a &ldquo;zero sum&rdquo; view of the world &ndash; it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;you win, I lose&rdquo; world. We therefore find it increasingly difficult to trust each other and our trust erodes &ndash; just look at all the surveys showing deteriorating trust in all of our major institutions.  These natural psychological reactions are in many cases amplified by the isolation that we experience as we begin to interact more with machines than with each other.</p><p> While understandable, these psychological reactions are highly dysfunctional, creating a vicious cycle of steadily increasing performance pressure and stress. We tend to become even more conscious of our imperfections, weaknesses and mistakes and determined to hide them from others, in the fear that they will create vulnerability that others will exploit. In that kind of world, we tend to suppress our imagination and stay within our comfort zone, looking for narrow ways to squeeze out that next increment of performance improvement, hoping that we can at least make it to the next quarter. In other words, we suppress our humanity and look longingly at the efficiency and reliability of the machines around us. We tighten our focus on the computer generated data and analytics that offer the promise of greater efficiency within the world as we know it.</p><h3> <strong>  But does it have to be that way? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The very same technology that is generating this mounting performance pressure also provides us with the platforms and tools to re-awaken our imagination and overcome the cognitive biases that keep us confined within the practices of the past. We can harness the powerful processing power of computers to help us imagine, visualize and explore worlds that go far beyond anything we have experienced to date. We can use sophisticated analytic tools to test and refine what we have imagined so that these new worlds can become even more fertile seedbeds of possibility and potential.  We can then harness computing power to imagine and design the products and services that will begin to make these imagined worlds a reality.</p><p> As our imagination revives, we&rsquo;ll begin to find ways to transcend our imperfections, weaknesses and mistakes.  They are indeed part of being human, and should be acknowledged as challenges that we all face, but they should never be allowed to stand in the way of the imagination that can help us to achieve more and more of our potential.  In fact, digital technology can provide effective tools to help us compensate for our imperfections, weaknesses and mistakes. As one example, we are able to deploy experimentation platforms that simulate environments and allow us to test new approaches before deploying them in the real world.</p><h3> <strong>  Done right, we can unleash a virtuous cycle. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The more we succeed in overcoming our imperfections, weaknesses and mistakes, the more willing we are to imagine more boldly and the more boldly we imagine, the more motivation we have to address and overcome our limitations</p><p> But the first requirement is to step back and reflect on what makes us uniquely human and what the consequences might be if we surrender our humanity to the mounting performance pressure that we are all experiencing. We need to understand that the choice is ours &ndash; that there is nothing inevitable about the trajectory that we are on. If we choose to re-claim our humanity, we can take the very same technology that is squeezing the humanity out of us and re-focus it on ways to reinforce and amplify our humanity. We can create worlds that were previously unimaginable and that will allow our humanity to flourish.</p><p> If we choose this path, the mounting performance pressure that we experience today can be transformed into excitement as we begin to see the opportunity to create new worlds that open up new potential and possibility.</p><p> It will be up to us to ultimately determine how we use that digital technology. Will we use it to narrowly squeeze out all inefficiency in the work we do? Or will we use it to catalyze and amplify the imagination that makes us uniquely human and that could identify entirely new avenues to create fundamentally new sources of value?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Most states&rsquo; 2016 fiscal year started July 1, but budget battles continue in Pennsylvania and Illinois. Both states have freshman Governors and legislative leaders from opposing political parties. </p><p> The lack of budget plans is straining state finances and causing credit downgrades.  Social services are being trimmed, college student financial aid is going undispersed and, worst of all, lottery winners can&rsquo;t collect their prize money and quit their jobs. In all seriousness, the lack of a budget is a credit concern because it indicates management can&rsquo;t deliver cost controls or revenue enhancement, which pressures liquidity levels. </p><p> These state budget impasses raise questions about local jurisdictions&rsquo; &ldquo;willingness&rdquo; to pay outstanding debt, because without state action, state aid distribution to local entities is in jeopardy. For example, S&amp;P Rating Services issued a six notch downgrade to BBB+ from AA+ on Chicago Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax backed bonds because the state budget bottleneck is delaying transfer payments to the Chicago&rsquo;s Motor Vehicle Fund. </p><p> At the end of September, Fitch Ratings issued a memo expressing concern about divergent ratings between state general obligation bonds and dedicated tax bonds like the Chicago Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax bonds.  Fitch argues that dedicated revenue bonds usually do not warrant ratings higher than entities&rsquo; G.O. rating. </p><p> However, considerable value can be had in dedicated tax revenue bonds where coverage ratios are strong and management displays a willingness to take action. So keep an eye out for more ratings movement and value opportunities in the dedicated tax bond sector. </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Recently I had an interesting conversation with a young woman. We were talking about financial advisors when I mentioned that advisors will have to justify their fees by actually delivering service once new fee transparency rules come into play.</p><h3> <strong>  I was not prepared when she said, &ldquo;what does &lsquo;providing service&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> I had to think for a while before I started listing the usual: listen, be respectful, meet on a regular basis, complete a financial plan, etc. But even as I was saying it, I realized how meaningless this was to her. <strong>  What I was listing was the minimum level of service that any financial advisor should provide, certainly not enough in many clients&rsquo; eyes to justify, in some cases, high fees. </strong></p><p> So instead I told her about an old friend who engaged a &ldquo;young&rdquo; financial advisor after her husband passed. When I asked her how it was going, she told me she loved him. <strong>  She said, &ldquo;he treats me like his mom. </strong> He knows I need an income from my investments but he also knows I am alone without family near by so he calls me regularly. He set me up with an accountant and a lawyer&rdquo;, she continued, &ldquo;and he asks about my health. He even told me I had enough money to hire someone to shovel my walk in winter &ndash; that I should save my back.&rdquo; <strong>  Now that&rsquo;s service, I thought! </strong></p><p> In contrast, I told her about an advisor who thought he was providing service. He was polite and attentive but sometimes didn&rsquo;t listen enough, especially when he was rushed. Not long ago, he gave the exact same plan to two women, who happened to be close friends &ndash; a fact he had forgotten. While their ages and net worth were similar, their life circumstances couldn&rsquo;t have been more different. One had an ailing husband and children who would probably need financial help. The other only had one child who was doing extremely well and her husband was younger than her. Needless to say when they compared their plans they weren&rsquo;t happy. They both fired him. Providing a cookie cutter plan is not service, no matter how nice you are.</p><p> &ldquo;You know, when you put it that way I get it,&rdquo; said my young friend. &ldquo;Personally, I would love to find a financial advisor who knows my family well enough to remember our eldest is off to university or one who can tell me whether it makes financial sense for me to take a part time job and work until I&rsquo;m 65, instead of 60.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  The take away </strong></h3><p> <br/> When it comes to providing service, it is about far more than being polite and delivering a template as a plan. You have to take the time to really get to know your clients and engage with them on a very personal level.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

    "content": "<strong> With the presidential election on the horizon, Social Security is finding its way into political discussions once again&mdash;on campaign trails, news programs, and everyday conversations.</strong>It helps to have <u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hillary Clinton </a></u> as a candidate, no matter what your views are on her politics. Her presence is great for bringing women&rsquo;s issues to the forefront, especially those that are affected by Social Security policy.  Of course, the men&mdash;<u> <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-on-congress-to-strengthen-and-expand-social-security\" target=\"_blank\">  Bernie Sanders </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Ted_Cruz_Social_Security.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ted Cruz </a></u>, and even <u> <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-donald-trumps-new-plan-for-social-security-crazy-2015-10-09\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Donald Trump </a></u>&mdash;are chiming in on Social Security too. One reason Social Security is great fodder for debate is because there are definitely some issues when it comes to women&rsquo;s Social Security benefits.Social Security benefits are calculated based on qualified lifetime earnings. You take out what you put in. Conceptually that may seem fair, but the gender wage gap drives down benefit amounts for women. And the issue isn&rsquo;t going away any time soon. In California, <u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrybrowngov\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Governor Jerry Brown </a></u> recently signed <u> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/07/446496402/california-governor-approves-law-targeting-wage-gap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fair pay legislation </a></u> to ensure women receive equal pay for equal work, but the income gap remains a reality. A survey by The American Association of University Women recently found that even in 2015, women are still earning 79% of the income earned by their male counterparts. And that report only includes full-time workers. Considering the number of women who leave the workforce&mdash;either temporarily or permanently&mdash;to serve as caregivers to children and other family members, that earnings discrepancy over a lifetime jumps even higher.The result: women&rsquo;s Social Security checks are smaller. According to the <u> <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/icp.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Social Security Administration </a></u>, the average retired woman <u> <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/icp.html\" target=\"_blank\">  receives $300 less a month </a></u> from Social Security than the average man. That&rsquo;s a huge problem because Social Security is even more important for women. <u> <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/women-and-social-security\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The National Women&rsquo;s Law Center </a></u> reports that 30% of women over 65 rely on Social Security for as much as 90% of their monthly income, compared to just 23% of men in the same age group. And because women live longer, by age 85 about two-thirds of Social Security recipients are women. This means women face the compounded problem of 1) living longer and 2) having less income to live on. It&rsquo;s a bad combination that puts women at a much greater risk of living in poverty in their senior years.<strong> The good news: there are claiming strategies that can help women maximize Social Security benefits to improve their finances throughout their golden years.</strong>Understanding what benefits are available, and then leveraging those benefits correctly can maximize your income over the long term. If you&rsquo;re a woman, here are five eye-openers that can help:<h3> <strong>  Claiming benefits before Full Retirement Age can cost you a bundle. </strong></h3>Whatever you do, try not to collect any benefits until you at least hit Full Retirement Age(FRA).Spend down your savings. Keep working. Do what it takes to pay the bills between age 63 and your FRA at age 66 or 67 (depending on your birth year). Why? Because between age 62 and FRA, your benefits increase 5% each year. Waiting until FRA also makes you eligible for other claiming strategies such as &ldquo;file and suspend&rdquo; and &ldquo;file and restrict.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Waiting until age 70 increases your benefits even more&mdash;which is vital for women. </strong></h3>A woman&rsquo;s longer life expectancy can be a blessing and a curse. We may get to enjoy more time with our grandkids, but it takes much more retirement income to support our longer lives. Between FRA and age 70, your benefits increase by 8% each year you delay, plus an annual cost of living adjustment. Doing the math, that means that if your monthly benefit at age 62 is $750, waiting to file until your 70th birthday boosts your monthly check to $1,320. That&rsquo;s quite a birthday present!<h3> <strong>  Getting your spouse to wait until age 70 to claim benefits increases your benefits.  </strong></h3>Spousal benefits are based on the other partner&rsquo;s benefit amount. By waiting until age 70 to claim benefits for the highest earner, both primary and spousal benefits are increased by 8% per year. And if your husband pushes to file earlier, twist his arm on this one. In general, men tend to focus on analysis that points to a breakeven point at age 77, but the goal should be to secure a higher monthly income over the long term&mdash;not just breaking even on a lump sum. No matter who is bringing home the bigger paycheck, delaying just four more years can make a huge difference to your joint benefits for years to come.<h3> <strong>  You divorce your spouse&mdash;not your right to spousal benefits.  </strong></h3>Many women don&rsquo;t even realize they can claim spousal benefits, typically equal to about 50% of their partner&rsquo;s full benefit amount, even if their marriage ends in divorce. As long as your marriage lasted 10 years or more, and you&rsquo;ve been divorced at least two years, and you are currently unmarried, you may have rights to full spousal benefits (about 50% of your ex-spouses benefit amount) without affecting your ex&rsquo;s benefits.<h3> <strong>  Your ex is worth more dead than alive.  </strong></h3>Spousal benefits are typically about 50% of your ex-husband&rsquo;s total benefit amount, while widow&rsquo;s benefits jump to 100% of that amount. If you&rsquo;re divorced, are currently unmarried, and your ex is still living, you can receive spousal benefits on his earnings record. And if he dies? You can receive twice that amount in widow&rsquo;s benefits (this is true even if your ex is remarried and his new spouse is filing her own claim).We may not be able to change the issues that impact Social Security earnings for women&mdash;at least not immediately. But by using the best possible claiming strategies, women can make the most of what&rsquo;s available to maximize Social Security income and support a long and financially comfortable retirement.",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Between work, family and play, it can be difficult to get a good night's sleep. </strong> While it's easy to tell you're tired after a night of tossing and turning, there are a few more subtle signs that indicate you're not getting the beauty rest you need and deserve.</p><p> If you find that many or all of the following signs are true for you,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-15411/the-sleep-secret-thats-better-than-drugs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   consider taking steps to improve the quality of your sleep  </a> </u> :</p><h3> <strong>  1. You can't stop hitting the snooze alarm. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Hitting the snooze alarm often is usually a sign that you either haven't had sufficient sleep or that the quality of your sleep is poor.</p><h3> <strong>  2. You sleep late on weekends. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you find that you're constantly sleeping later on weekends, this may be due to the sleep debt you built up during the week.</p><p> Unfortunately, this catch-up sleep can't make up for your lack of sleep. Even worse, it may throw your circadian clock off, making it more difficult to fall asleep on Sunday night.</p><h3> <strong>  3. You're irritable and moody. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It's unfortunate that so many of us fail to realize how insufficient sleep affects our moods. Sleep is very important in our processing of emotions.</p><h3> <strong>  4. You get frequent coughs and colds. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/expert-answers/lack-of-sleep/faq-20057757\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   studies have demonstrated  </a> </u>  the importance of sleep in relation to our immune system. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Soundly-Every-Night-Fantastic/dp/1936303728/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=mind0a3-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in my book  </a> </u>  I examine sleep and its relationship to the immune system.</p><h3> <strong>  5. You can't shed those pounds. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Insufficient sleep  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18239586\" target=\"_blank\">  i  <u>   s a major cause of obesity  </u> </a> . When the body does not get enough sleep, it tends to overproduce an appetite-stimulating hormone called ghrelin, and underproduce an appetite-suppressing hormone called leptin.</p><h3> <strong>  6. You're unable to focus and remember. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sleep is a necessity if you want to be able to concentrate, problem solve, and remember things. During sleep, toxins that build up in the brain throughout the day called beta amyloid  <a href=\"http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3956\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   are cleared at a rate 10 times greater than during wakefulness  </u>  . </a>  Also during sleep, information is uploaded and consolidated into our long-term memories. That is the reason that most people perform better on testing after  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/\" target=\"_blank\">   a good night's sleep  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  7. Your blood sugar is creeping up. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Inadequate sleep is a cause of insulin resistance. In fact, many people labeled prediabetic  <u>  <a href=\"http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/129/129ra43\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   will return to normal  </a> </u>  if they start to get seven to nine hours of sleep.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Your blood pressure starts to increase. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Sleep is very important to cardiovascular health. Actually, our blood pressure is usually 15 points lower when we are asleep; this is called \"nocturnal dipping.\" If you are consistently getting less than seven hours of sleep a night you may end up paying the price in the form of high blood pressure.</p><h3> <strong>  9. You consume caffeine all day. </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are many of us who consume coffee or caffeinated soft drinks from morning until night. In many instances, we have become so dependent on it to stay awake that we no longer realize why we are doing it. I have found in my sleep practice that this is frequently a sign of not enough or poor quality sleep.</p><p> The bottom line is that we need to appreciate how important sleep is to our physical and mental well-being. Too many of us fight sleep, not wanting to miss anything. Unfortunately, like most things in life, there are consequences when we do things in excess.</p><p> It's very important to have an adult ritual before bedtime. This should consist of relaxing activities such as reading, listening to music, prayer or meditation. Above all avoid computers, televisions, iPads and cellphones at least one hour before bedtime. Eliminate all sources of caffeine, including dark chocolate, at least six hours before bedtime. Finally, exercise regularly! </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In  <u>  <a href=\"/sell/marketing/investment-scams-are-your-clients-at-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   last week&rsquo;s blog  </a> </u>  post , we talked about the prevalence of investment scams in Canada and which Canadians are most at risk. As an advisor, you can&rsquo;t be responsible for every investment decision &ndash; good or bad &ndash; your  clients make.But you can help clients by making sure they know the following warning signs of an investment scam. You can also advise them on how to report a scam if they become a victim.</p><h3> What to watch for</h3><h3> <strong>  1. Intense sales pressure </strong></h3>Somebody who&rsquo;s selling a legitimate investment won&rsquo;t put pressure on your client to &ldquo;Act fast!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Buy now!&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll encourage your client to go home and do their own research on the investment to make sure it&rsquo;s right for them.High-pressure sales tactics are almost always a sign of a bad deal. Likewise, if your client does try to research the investment on their own and can&rsquo;t find any information, it&rsquo;s likely a scam.Remind clients that a real investment advisor selling a legitimate investment product will be registered by a provincial securities commission. Clients can <u> <a href=\"http://www.securities-administrators.ca/nrs/nrsearchResult.aspx?ID=1325\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  search for registered individuals </a></u> and firms on the Canadian Securities Administrators website.<h3> <strong>  2. Offering high returns for low (or no) risk </strong></h3>It&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;, but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Real investments come with risk. And the higher the potential return, the higher the level of risk. Anybody promising double-digit returns for virtually no risk is lying.<h3> <strong>  3. The promise of &ldquo;insider&rdquo; information </strong></h3>Another tactic often used by scam artists is the promise of a big deal about to be made or a big event about to happen that is sure to make your client&rsquo;s investment soar. And nobody else knows about this big deal/event, so your client is really lucky to be getting this information.Remind clients that sharing insider information is illegal, and it&rsquo;s not something a registered investment advisor would do. Most likely, the &ldquo;insider information&rdquo; is completely fictional, but even if it&rsquo;s not, acting on it will get your client into serious legal trouble.Most likely, the &ldquo;insider information&rdquo; is completely fictional, but even if it&rsquo;s not, acting on it will get your client into serious legal trouble.<h3> Reporting a scam</h3>Finally, if a client does fall for a scam, advise them to report it to the CAFC, which is an RCMP service. Unfortunately, most victims of fraud don&rsquo;t get their money back, but reporting the scam is your client&rsquo;s best chance. It&rsquo;s also the only way the scam artist will get caught.The <u> <a href=\"http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/index-eng.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CAFC </a></u> is also a great resource for information on current scams that clients should watch for.",

    "link": "5-ways-to-develop-thicker-skin-to-become-more-resilient",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Being nice to colleagues is one of the first casualties when work gets stressful. So how can we develop a thicker skin and become more resilient when we&rsquo;re in a fast-paced environment that produces criticism that stings us? </strong></p><p> Most of us can shrug off a certain amount of criticism by telling ourselves not to take the comment personally. But when you are face to face with someone who accuses you of lying, betraying their trust, or not caring about other team members, it&rsquo;s hard not to take it a little personally.</p><p> Many of us work in fast-paced, high-stress environments and we know how important it is to have a strong mind. So what happens when we realize that we actually do care what people think of us?</p><p> Being sensitive to criticism can hold you back. Here are 5 ways you can develop a thicker skin to become more resilient:</p><h3> 1. Welcome Constructive Criticism</h3><p> <br/> Every successful leader and entrepreneur has not only been criticized in their career, but they have also failed spectacularly at something along the way.</p><p> If criticism is coming your way because of something you did wrong, be thankful that someone is willing to take the time to let you know how badly you did mess up. So what if the tone is loud and the words are sharp!</p><p> Grit up!</p><p> If there is a nugget of information that can help you become more successful, grab onto it and let it teach you what you need to know. When feeling down in the dumps after her employees blamed her for glitch on a marketing program, a friend of mine was told by her boss, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to put your big-girl panties on now.&rdquo;</p><p> Maybe his words were not politically-correct or even polite, but my friend got the message&mdash;grow up and face the fact that there will be a few bruises and scars in moving up the ladder of success. The key is to sift through the dross to find the nugget of wisdom&mdash;and learn from it.</p><p> TIP: Write down the basics of the critical comment so you can go over it later, when emotions have been tamped down, and you can take a closer look at the facts. Address the errors you made and how you will avoid doing the same in the future.</p><h3> 2. Throw Out The Junk Comments</h3><p> <br/> Just as it&rsquo;s important to squeeze every ounce of understanding out of a criticism laden with constructive observation, be smart enough to jettison the junk comments that reflect more on the person speaking than your performance.</p><p> Stress makes us more emotional and blurting out hurtful or negative comments is common. The reason is that  <u>  stress decreases our &ldquo;working memory. </u> &rdquo; which is the amount of information we hold in our mind.</p><p> When we are under stress, our working memory doesn&rsquo;t allow us to access big chunks of information about the individual whom we are criticizing. All our brain can access is why we&rsquo;re pissed off at this person. As a result, we say things we really do not mean.</p><p> This is when we shouldn&rsquo;t take a negative criticism personally.</p><p> TIP: As you think about a conversation or communication, separate fact from interpretation.</p><h3> 3. Nurture Important Relationships</h3><p> <br/> When you are being assaulted by negative comments and criticism at work, it&rsquo;s critical that you stay close to people who will support and encourage you. If you do not have strong connections with a core group of friends or family, take the time to do so.</p><p> <u>  Relationships with others </u>  reminds us that we are not alone and that all of us struggle. Talk out your fears and concerns. Once you do, you may find that people who exude the outward appearance of confidence and success have the same fears and concerns that you do.</p><p> This is where self-care becomes very important. </p><p> When you&rsquo;re stressed, it&rsquo;s easy to become worn down emotionally and physically. Even minor stressors feel like a major event.</p><p> TIP: Seek out supportive friends or family members so you can give and receive the assistance that we all need at times. This includes developing a proper relationship with yourself&mdash;make healthy lifestyle choices that remind you that you&rsquo;re a priority.</p><h3> 4. Create A Success List</h3><p> <br/> Most critical remarks contain a combination of constructive and junk comments. It&rsquo;s not always easy to quickly sort out the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p><p> Make a list of some of your accomplishments in your current situation. If you don&rsquo;t feel good about your contributions, you will take the criticism harder. </p><p> Whenever you are feeling down or unjustly criticized, take a long and loving look at that list. Remember that you&rsquo;ve made significant impact on your work environment and that all the negativity flowing around you does not accurately represent your accomplishments. </p><p> TIP:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.science20.com/news/writing_down_feelings_really_does_make_us_feel_better_study_says\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Writing stuff down helps you to visualize  </a> </u> , so keep paper and pen handy. Typing your list out on a computer does not satisfy the brain&rsquo;s need for visualization. Remember projects that have gone well, people you have helped out, or prospects who were happy with your services.</p><h3> 5. Examine The Deeper Wound</h3><p> <br/> The ability to look at a criticism objectively has a lot to do with self-awareness. Sometimes the reason a person&rsquo;s comment hurts so deeply is because it pricks at a deeper wound from our past. </p><p> Self-awareness will allow you to identify the original injury so you can gain proper perspective on your reaction to your current situation. For example, if image is extremely important to you, any implied criticism that calls into question the image you are portraying will wound more deeply than other ones.</p><p> We often do not realize the tender places from our past, and a rejection found in a critical remark can unconsciously take you all the way back to why you didn&rsquo;t get the red ball in the playground.</p><p> TIP: Spend time getting to know who you are, what makes you tick, and what pushes your buttons. Not all childhood memories will be pleasant, but toughen up. Pretending painful past experiences aren&rsquo;t influencing your behavior in negative ways today is just plain stupid.</p><p> No one gets a pass on life. Scars from life&rsquo;s battles are the places where we are the toughest and our skin is the thickest. Do not let those experiences slip away before you&rsquo;ve had the chance to learn all they have to teach you.</p><p> How have you developed a thicker skin and become more resilient?</p> ",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Having a will and a final plan in place is recommended as soon as we enter into adulthood. If we don&rsquo;t take care of it then, we should make some decisions when a major life event has occurred such as a marriage, birth of a child or on receiving an inheritance.As daunting as tackling issues related to our own mortality is, it is inevitable. The best option is to deal with these issues head on, and sooner rather than later. But long before your family members will be dealing with your mortality, you&rsquo;ll likely be dealing with your parents&rsquo; final arrangements. The reality is, your aging parents will need assistance with their personal and financial planning affairs.</p><h3> How to Talk About a Will and a Final Plan</h3>Talking with your parents about mortality and money is never easy but it&rsquo;s an important thing to do. If you find it difficult to discuss these issues, you can start by discussing your own will and final wishes. Getting their input on your decisions can help you understand the choices that they have made. Hopefully this will open the door to discuss their wishes.<strong> Things that you need to discuss:</strong>1.<strong>  What they owe, where and to whom. </strong>Understanding their level and type of debt is essential. This can include investment properties and investment accounts, as well as lines of credit, credit cards, auto loans and home loans. Although you may not go over this during your initial conversation about their financial planning status, it&rsquo;s important that you understand exactly what is owed and where those accounts are held.2.<strong>  Their will.</strong> Although it may seem grim, you need to know what to expect when your parent passes. Be sure to discuss the pertinent details of the will and know who the executor of the will is. This discussion should also include whether they have signed a living will and what their wishes are regarding end of life care.3.<strong>  Power of attorneys or representation agreements These documents are essential in a health crisis, and it&rsquo;s important for you and your parents to have them signed well ahead of time. It&rsquo;s far better to have these documents in place long before they are needed.</strong>4. <strong> Care scenarios.</strong> Do you and your parents have plans for what will happen if they become ill or incapacitated? This may be the most difficult of all conversations, so you may want to handle this separately from the other financial issues. Be sure to cover whether they&rsquo;ll downsize and move in with you or go into care facilities. Be honest about whether you are willing and able to provide care.You may want to put your parents&rsquo; name on a waiting list for a seniors&rsquo; residence or long-term care facility in anticipation of their future needs anyway in case your situation changes in the future.5. <strong> Final arrangements.</strong> Burial arrangements and other final arrangements are important to cover with your parents as well. If you understand what your parents&rsquo; final wishes are, it will make it easier for you to follow through with them.You need to talk early and often with your parents about finances. As they grow older, they&rsquo;ll become more in need of your assistance with their day to day lives. Whether this comes in the form of financial assistance, shared living space or medical care, it&rsquo;s important to understand exactly what you&rsquo;ll be facing when that time comes. Don&rsquo;t try to talk about all of these issues at once. Make it a point to talk with them regularly so you can keep the lines of communication open.As an <u> <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.ca/rhondasherwood/your-team.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  experienced financial advisor </a></u>, I can provide assistance in getting the conversation started and offer advice with planning for future needs for both you and your parents.",

    "link": "11-financial-behaviors-you-dont-want-your-kids-to-learn-from-you",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjeffrose\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jeff Rose  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Good Financial Cents  </a> </u></p><p> There&rsquo;s nothing I would love better than to sit down and tell my three boys all the right things do about money.</p><p> Unfortunately, just as is the case with every other lesson we provide, kids learn more from what we do than what we say.</p><p> My boys are no exception to this.</p><p> If our words say one thing, but our behavior goes in the opposite direction, the kids will come away with our behavior but not our words.</p><p> So how you behave with money will be the most important financial lesson that you can teach your kids.</p><p> Along that line, there are some financial behaviors you don&rsquo;t want your kids to learn from you.</p><h3> 1. You Operate Without a Budget</h3><p> <br/> If you spend without a budget &ndash; meaning that you buy what you want/need without regard for the cost &ndash; your kids will pick up on that. They&rsquo;ll automatically disassociate buying from cost.</p><p> In that way, your absence of a budget will become their legacy. They won&rsquo;t have a budget either, and will reap the negative consequences that come from a lack of spending discipline.</p><h3> 2. Debt Is Your Friend</h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest financial problems many households have is almost a silent one. It isn&rsquo;t debt itself, but rather the quiet acceptance of it as some sort of &ldquo;friend&rdquo; in your life. If you come to see debt in that way, your kids will too.</p><p> But debt represents a reduction in future income, because you are paying for yesterday&rsquo;s expenses today, and today&rsquo;s expenses tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a complex game of kick the can, and hopefully kicking it far enough down the road that it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you in any way today.</p><p> This is not a healthy view of debt. You can and should  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/ways-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-debt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   talk to your kids about debt  </a> </u> , but how you handle it yourself is much more important.</p><h3> 3. If Our Friends Have It, We Need It</h3><p> <br/> If you are taking your spending cues from your friends, you&rsquo;re subtly teaching your kids to let their spending choices be determined by other people. </p><p> And if other people are indirectly in control of your spending, then it means that you aren&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s a lesson your kids don&rsquo;t need to learn.</p><h3> 4. Credit Cards Are a Way of Life</h3><p> <br/> Do your kids you see spending money primarily using credit cards? It may be good to increase your spending using cash. </p><p> This will give your kids an opportunity to see that spending money costs actual money and isn&rsquo;t accomplished solely with the use of a magical card that seems to provide all that&rsquo;s ever needed. It&rsquo;s a visual lesson, but a powerful one that works better for kids.</p><p> There&rsquo;s another possibility from the constant use of credit cards. It&rsquo;s easier to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/dont-get-sucker-puched-by-your-own-debt-denial/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   deny that you have a debt problem  </a> </u>  when you&rsquo;re using credit, also because actual cash doesn&rsquo;t leave your wallet or your bank account. Kids can get caught up in that denial as well.</p><h3> 5. You Deserve the Best Things in Life</h3><p> <br/> Do you often buy things because you think &ldquo;I deserve it&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s OK to treat yourself every now and again, but the more important criteria is &ldquo;Can I REALLY afford it?&rdquo;</p><p> If your kids see you constantly buying things because you feel you deserve them, they may develop an entitlement mentality. That can see them buying things they cannot afford very early in life, and it won&rsquo;t get better as they get older.</p><h3> 6. Never Talking About Money</h3><p> <br/> This is another form of denial. It may be that you don&rsquo;t talk about money because it is a contentious issue in your marriage. That&rsquo;s never a good sign in itself! </p><p> But if you never talk about money around your kids, they probably won&rsquo;t develop a constructive idea of what things cost, or that it even matters. </p><p> There&rsquo;s enough of that happening on TV and you need to specifically avoid reinforcing that message.</p>Not only should kids hear you talk about money, kids should have financial responsibilities that are appropriate to their age. Tying an allowance to chores around the home, or having them donate some of their allowance a charity are excellent lessons for kids to learn. <p> It&rsquo;s all about earning and giving, two activities that will only become more important as they grow older.</p><h3> 7. &ldquo;Eat, Drink and Be Merry, for Tomorrow We Die!&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> People often use this as a justification to live the good life, and in a way that&rsquo;s toxic to their finances. It&rsquo;s actually a Bible verse &mdash; 1 Corinthians 15:32 &ndash; that&rsquo;s often misinterpreted to suggest that you should spend like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.</p><p> What if you eat, drink and be merry (and go deep into debt to do so) and you don&rsquo;t die tomorrow?</p><p> If you apply the misinterpretation of this verse to your finances, what you&rsquo;re really saying &ndash; and demonstrating to your kids &ndash; is that we live to the fullest now because we may not be here tomorrow. </p><p> From a financial standpoint, passing that notion onto your kids is a complete disaster. It tells them that there is no point in preparing for the future, which is about the worst financial lesson possible.</p><h3> 8. Not Setting Savings or Investing Goals</h3><p> <br/> You should have savings and investing goals and your children should be at least loosely aware that those goals exist and what they&rsquo;re for. Goals are an opportunity to show children that some objectives require preparation and work.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also a way of demonstrating delayed gratification &ndash; you are doing without now in order to achieve or accomplish something really important later. That&rsquo;s definitely a lesson your kids need to learn.</p><p> In certain situations it may not even be extreme to have your children contribute toward the goal in some way. It may be by adding just a few nickels and dimes into a family pot, or even by participation with some sort of activity. That contribution will validate the goal for you kids.</p><h3> 9. Always Take Advantage of a Sale</h3><p> <br/> This is one of the biggest money myths in existence. While it is possible to save money making a major purchase when it is on sale, if serial sales are being used to justify serial spending sprees, then all you&rsquo;re doing is wasting money.</p><p> It&rsquo;s one of the oldest marketing tricks in the book &ndash; run sales to get people to buy what they wouldn&rsquo;t buy otherwise. Avoiding the hook demonstrates a healthy amount of self-restraint. And that&rsquo;s always a good lesson to teach your kids, particularly when it comes to money.</p><h3> 10. Keeping Financial Secrets</h3><p> <br/> Have you ever bought something, then told your children not to tell your spouse? That&rsquo;s not a harmless request.</p><p> There are two negative outcomes that are likely to result:</p><li> The kids will sense that there&rsquo;s a problem, and/or</li><li> You&rsquo;ll be giving them a green light to think that it&rsquo;s OK to lie about money &ndash; even if you&rsquo;ve otherwise taught them not to lie in general. <br/>  </li><p> Can that have a happy ending?</p><h3> 11. Pretending That Financial Habits Don&rsquo;t Affect Health</h3><p> <br/> If you are living on the financial edge, it&rsquo;s probably affecting your health to one degree or another. Enough financial stress, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/dear-dad-why-did-you-let-debt-kill-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   being deep in debt  </a> </u>  can even shorten your life.</p><p> If not for your own sake, for your children&rsquo;s sake, get control of your finances and especially of your debt situation. </p><p> Your health may depend on it, and you should also have a goal of making sure that your kids don&rsquo;t experience the same life-shortening fate.</p><p> Though you may think that your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/good-financial-habits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   financial habits  </a> </u>  go unnoticed by your kids, rest assured that they don&rsquo;t. No matter how much you lecture your kids about good financial practices, it&rsquo;s your own financial behavior that will have the greatest impact on their adult lives. You have an opportunity to make that the most positive experience possible right now. Take advantage of it for all that it&rsquo;s worth!</p>",

    "content": "<p> You heard it. Twitter, the social media giant, laid off a whopping 336 employees (AKA 8% of their workforce).</p><p> At first, the hashtag  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Twitterlayoffs&amp;src=tyah\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #Twitterlayoffs  </a> </u>  was used by former employees to unleash their woes, by the media to break the news, and by the general public to offer support. But in an interesting turn of events, this hashtag is now chock-full of hungry recruiters eager to tap into this pool of top talent.</p><p> So what social recruitment strategies can we learn from this event?</p><h3> 1. Skip the job boards</h3><p> <br/> Forget Monster.com or CareerBuilder. Scout candidates on Twitter or LinkedIn. With Twitter, you can search hashtags such as #contentmarketer then narrowing your results by selecting the \"near you\" option.</p><p> <img alt=\"Screen_Shot_2015-10-13_at_10.49.16_PM\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2015-10-13_at_10.49.16_PM.png?t=1444934333256&amp;width=550\"/></p><p>  </p><p> It's similar with LinkedIn. Search for related positions and select the city near you. (Oh hey, it's me!)</p><p> <img alt=\"Screen_Shot_2015-10-13_at_10.54.21_PM\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2015-10-13_at_10.54.21_PM.png?t=1444934333256&amp;width=550\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Sure this may not be the route you want to take because it involves poaching people, but in this day and age, recruiters need to seek out talent.</p><h3> 2. Keep up with trending hashtags</h3><p> <br/> If you're a recruiter trying to fill an engineer role, and you're just idly refreshing your inbox in hopes that a qualified candidate will magically apply, you're missing out. Just take a look at #Twitterlayoffs. It's already well known that these giant tech companies only seek out the best of the best. So who wouldn't want one of these folks at their own company?</p><h3> 3. Spruce up your website and social presence</h3><p> <br/> You can be sure that if you contact a job candidate, they're going to look up your company's website and social media pages. If your pages aren't up to par and looks as if a ten-year-old child slapped it together, you can be sure that you won't be hearing back from that candidate.</p><p> Tell your company's story, show some behind-the-scenes pictures &mdash; make it so that whenever a candidate comes to these pages, they'll feel like they need to be a part of your organization.</p>",

    "content": "This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.It takes the average person <u> <a href=\"https://designmodo.com/infographics-statistics-web-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  0.5 seconds </a></u> to form an opinion of your entire company brand based on your website. Additionally, <u> <a href=\"http://inspiredm.com/web-design-statistics-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  88 percent of consumers </a></u> are less likely to return to a company&rsquo;s website if they have a bad experience on their initial visit.How&rsquo;s your company website?Website redesign can be a major investment for companies, which is why it&rsquo;s critical to ensure you&rsquo;re able to eventually see a return on your dollars spent.If you&rsquo;re unsure whether your company website is due for an upgrade, here are some positive signs your site needs some improvement in the form of a website redesign:<h3> 1. It&rsquo;s Not Mobile Friendly</h3><u> 40 percent of online shoppers and researchers</u> will leave a website if their first choice isn&rsquo;t mobile-optimized. Few brands can afford to lose 40 percent of their potential prospects simply because they&rsquo;re not offering a web experience that&rsquo;s friendly to smartphones and tablets. And yet they do. Nearly 80 percent of people today use their smartphones to make purchases and product decisions &mdash; for personal reasons <strong> and for business research.</strong>A mobile-optimized website isn&rsquo;t an optional benefit &ndash; it&rsquo;s a requirement of having a website that&rsquo;s built for the modern reader.  It&rsquo;s a requirement for virtually all brands.<strong> Pro tip:</strong> We manage websites for nearly 100 companies, and our research shows that as much as 50% of website visitors use phones or tablets to bring up company websites. Mobile isn&rsquo;t just a nice to have anymore. Read our no-cost guide called <u> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/why-your-business-needs-a-mobile-friendly-website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Why You Need a Mobile Friendly website today </a></u>, or check out some information about <u> <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/should-you-consider-a-responsive-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  responsive design for mobile devices </a></u>.<h3> 2. Your Website Uses Flash</h3>Website animations and videos can be a powerful way to engage your prospects and customers, as there are over 50 billion views of videos online each month. However, Flash is an outdated way to deliver animation and navigation, and users of your website may be more likely to leave your site than download a new version of the program. HTML5 can be a more user-friendly alternative.<strong> Pro tip:</strong> Flash is officially defunct, yet thousands of websites still use it.  If yours does, it can erode your company brand because it can make your website unusable.<h3> 3. Your Homepage is Busy</h3>First impressions made online are <u> <a href=\"http://www.kinesisinc.com/the-truth-about-web-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  94 percent related to visuals </a></u>. Opting for a website homepage that&rsquo;s cram-packed full of written content, links and information is an outdated website design method. Choosing a clean design and simple, intuitive navigation will be far more visually appealing and usable to your prospects.<strong> Pro tip: </strong>Too many links on the homepage of your website is the kiss of death. It&rsquo;s not difficult to determine exactly what your customers want to see first. Pare down the content on the homepage to only what your customers need.<h3> 4. You Lack Social Proof</h3><a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/88-consumers-trust-online-reviews-much-personal-recommendations-195803\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  88 percent of people </u></a> trust online reviews just as much as personal recommendations from friends and family. Adding testimonials from your current clients and other forms of social proof, such as logos, trust marks and other signs can improve your site&rsquo;s ability to win the trust of your prospects.<h3> 5. It&rsquo;s Not Conversion-Optimized</h3>If your site isn&rsquo;t optimized to convert visitors into sales leads, you may struggle to win customers and see marketing or sales benefit from your website. Adding calls-to-action, landing pages and high-quality content offers to your website can significantly increase your company&rsquo;s ability to turn a casual website visitor into a potential sales opportunity.<strong> Pro tip:</strong> Every website has conversion opportunities (even ours!).  Most websites turn less than a half a percent of visitors into a contact. Doubling your conversion rate means twice as many contacts from your website.<a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/></a>",

    "content": "<p> One year ago Kathy Caprino, a Career Coach for women, wrote an article titled  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2014/04/26/the-top-5-reasons-women-resist-investing-in-themselves-and-how-it-hurts-them/\" target=\"_blank\">   The Top Five Reasons Women Resist Investing in Themselves and How it Hurts Them  </a> </u> . From her seat, Caprino sees women pass up on opportunities for professional growth in ways that men do not.  She stated that women are less confident than men about investing in their own growth for the following reasons (among others): </p><li> They're not sure if the time is right</li><li> They're unclear on the return on investment</li><li> They feel guilty about spending money on a growth experience for their self</li><p> <br/> I've struggled with all of these myself!  When I've evaluated past personal or professional growth opportunities, I have often found myself looking first at the price tag attached to the experience. I ponder questions like: </p><li> Is this something I/we should really be spending money on right now? Or </li><li> What else might we need that money for? </li><p> <br/> Unfortunately, by evaluating the price of the experience or program before the expected value or outcome, I've let what were probably wonderful opportunities for growth slip through my fingers because they were \"too expensive.\"  Other times, I've opted to spend a \"more reasonable\" amount of money on an experience that was not worth the little bit of money I paid.  <br/> <br/> I get it. Sometimes you read a description for an event or a service and you have no idea what you are going to walk away with. I've been there, many times. I have struggled with not having a specific event description, not having a detailed agenda, and not having a checklist of what I can expect to accomplish or experience with a particular event or service.  <br/> <br/> This came up for me recently when I was trying to decide whether or not to attend a Self-Compassion program.  The overall cost of the program (including travel costs) were much more than I thought I \"should\" be spending, AND the event was for a full week, which flared up my mommy guilt.  There was no detailed program description, no expected outcomes, no agenda. I even reached out to the coordinator requesting more information but did not receive it.  This created a lot of anxiousness for me and initially led to indecision about whether or not I should attend.   <br/> <br/> Ultimately, I felt pulled to be there and I signed up, but only after much consternation and deliberation! Other than the price, I reflected on how this program might help me with my personal and professional growth and how it could contribute to the development of new skills. Although I did feel nervous about the possibility of attending this event (because even though I didn't know exactly what was going to happen while I was there, I knew enough about the topic - and myself - to know that it would stretch my comfort zone. In big ways.).  <br/> <br/> Even in the space of this nervousness, I was feeling excited about the possibility of attending, about how wonderful it could be.  I knew in my heart and in my gut that I would regret it if I let the opportunity pass me by. <br/> <br/> Ladies, we need to invest in ourselves.  Without guilt. We are all worth it. We deserve to grow and stretch and try new things. We deserve to take a day off. For ourselves. We deserve (and I would argue, we NEED) to nourish our own soul.  When evaluating personal or professional growth opportunities, this requires us to tune into our own heart and to listen to our intuition. Although I don't agree with everything Caprino wrote in her article, I do agree that we are the best judge of what's best for us.  We know, at a deeper soul level, what we need and what will help us move one more step forward on our journey.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  We can never know for sure if an experience will be worth it before we participate in the experience. </strong>  However, unless we take the risk and make the investment, we'll never know.   <br/> <br/> How might your beliefs or fears be holding you back from getting what you need for personal or professional growth?  <br/> <br/> <strong>  What opportunity might you regret if you don't do it? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Former Apple &amp; Microsoft executive Linda Stone coined the term &ldquo;continuous partial attention&rdquo; to describe the growing phenomena whereby we split attention between multiple sources of interaction such as pulling out our iPhone to check a text message chime instead of continuing to interact with friends or customers.  There is something about a phone call, text message chirp, or an indication that &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got mail,&rdquo; which seems to compel many people to drop face-to-face personal contact and rush to the summons of the electronic intrusion.  Literally, I have had to encourage a former staff member to move on to better suited employment, after repeated instances in which I observed him engage in text messaging in the presence of clients.</p><p> Before I sound like I am &ldquo;holier than&rdquo; those who frequently begin a service interaction with me only to interrupt it to respond to some other information source, I realize that I also suffer from &ldquo;continuous partial attention disorder&rdquo; (not with external customers) but when it comes to my own staff.  Sadly, it is all too common that I will interrupt a call with my SVP of operations to jump on an incoming call from an unknown number.  More often than not, I fail to give my team member full respect and attention and instead frantically rush to a caller trying to sell me a newspaper subscription. That serves me right but servers my team member wrong!</p><p> I see &ldquo;continuous partial attention&rdquo; as an emerging challenge for service providers; particularly, with the proliferation of mobile technology.  I have now been misserved by people who have done everything from continuing to listen to music through one earbud while interacting with me, to individuals who have failed to cease a personal mobile phone conversation to initiate service, and even those who were playing drawing games with friends during a business meeting.  What examples have you encountered?</p><p> Imagine how you would stand out, if your business was devoid of &ldquo;continuous partial attention.&rdquo;  I am redoubling my commitment to create a &ldquo;fully present zone&rdquo; within my business both as it relates to my internal as well as external customers.</p><p> I just wonder if there is any hope for encouraging my teenage daughter to do the same during dinner?</p> ",

    "content": "<h3> There are a number of reasons why people choose to change careers. It could be because they were let go by their previous employers, or perhaps they have lost interest in their job. Whatever the reasons may be, it is normal for people to desire working in a different field. If you have been considering switching careers, it's vital that you make the necessary preparations to ensure the success of your move.</h3><p> <br/> Below are some tips that can help you:</p><h3> Identify what it is that you enjoy doing</h3><p> <br/> If you are changing careers because you are no longer happy with your current position, you have to make sure that you transfer into an area that will stimulate and motivate you. Before applying for another job or accepting a job offer, take the time to think about what you are interested in and what kind of environment you will thrive in.</p><h3> Do enough research about your new career</h3><p> <br/> Once you have determined which field you want to pursue, begin your research on it. Especially if your career change is drastic, you need to learn everything about the new industry you are planning to penetrate. It would benefit you also if you could talk to someone who works in the same industry. Your goal is to gather as much information as possible about what it is like to work in that sector.</p><h3> Consider getting new training</h3><p> <br/> Often, passion is just not enough to get you the job or career you've always wanted. Employers will still want you to have the experience and the skills for the position you are applying for. After assessing yourself and you find out that you lack the most important skills required for the job you are applying for, consider undergoing some sort of training. You may enroll in some short courses, or you can take an internship program as well. Through these, you will be able to acquire not only the knowledge, but also the experience that will make you qualified for the career you want.</p><h3> Network, network, network</h3><p> <br/> Your networking skills will play a crucial role in your career change success. If you know someone who is working in the field you are interested in, don't hesitate to connect with them and seek help from them. They could also offer you some job leads or even just pieces of advice on what you should do to qualify for a specific position in the same industry.</p><h3> Be flexible</h3><p> <br/> Since you are switching careers, you will need to start from scratch. You can't expect to have the kind of status and respect you used to have in your previous career. You have to work your way up once again. Thus, <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you have to be patient with your career planning  </a> </u> , and soon you will find yourself successful in your new career.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The prospective client interviewing me was nervous and skeptical. </strong> She insisted on some type of guarantee that, if she hired my firm to manage her investments held for retirement, we would make her money.</p><p> I asked her what she meant by \"make her money.\" She said that her balance would never go down. \"No, I can&rsquo;t guarantee that,\" I said.</p><p> \"How about if it doesn&rsquo;t go down at the end of any year?\" I again said no. \"How about at the end of three years?\" No. \"Five?\" \"No. I can&rsquo;t give you a guarantee.\" \"How about ten years? Can you guarantee I will make money over ten years?\"</p><p> Finally, out of frustration, I succumbed. <strong>  \"Okay, I will give you a guarantee.\" </strong> A puzzled look crossed her face. <strong>  \"I will guarantee you that at times we will lose you money.\" </strong> The interview wrapped up shortly after that, and she never became a client.</p><p> Looking at the situation from her perspective, who could fault her for walking away? Can you imagine a hypothetical conversation with a friend who might ask how her interview went with the investment advisor? \"Oh, he would only guarantee me that he would lose me money.\"</p><h3> Who in their right mind wants to hire that investment advisor?</h3><p> <br/> While my comment may have been a bit brash and tactless, it was still true. If making money means a portfolio will never decline, then I&rsquo;ve lost clients and myself a lot of money over the years. Any portfolio, even one invested in a diversified array of asset classes, will fluctuate daily. Portfolios peak and fall. Rarely do they ever plateau, at least not for long. Peaks are inherently unsustainable, just as are valleys.</p><p> Long-term investment progress often can look like taking three steps forward, four steps back, six steps forward, and four steps back. That&rsquo;s a lot of steps back and forth to have gone one step forward!</p><p> The only way I know to be guaranteed your portfolio will go up in value every year and never decrease is to lend your money to a bank through savings accounts or certificates of deposit. However, you must keep any account under $250,000 to qualify for the government guarantee. Any amount over that could be lost if the lending institution fails.</p><p> That&rsquo;s it for guaranteed investments. No other investment vehicles&mdash;bonds, stocks, annuities, retirement plans, deferred compensation plans, or cash value life insurance&mdash;come with an ironclad guarantee that you will never lose any of your principal.</p><h3> So if good investors are guaranteed to lose money, what will great investors do?</h3><p> <br/> While they will also lose money over the short term, over the long term they will do just average. \"Average\" here is defined as equaling an index return. If equating \"great\" and \"average\" sounds like an oxymoron to you, consider that over a twenty-year span, 97% of investors don&rsquo;t obtain an average (index) return. As I have said before, investing is the only competitive sport where being average puts you in the top 3%.</p><p> A good money manager or investor with an eye on the long term will almost always lose money. Guaranteed. The manager may be a personal investment advisor, a bank trust officer, the CIO of an institutional pension fund, or a mutual fund manager. If they are good, they all will eventually lose money.</p><p> I know of only two types of investment managers who makes money year after year. <strong>  One type only talks about their winners and conveniently forgets their losers. The other type runs Ponzi schemes. Ethical investment advisors cannot guarantee you will never lose money. </strong></p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In his landmark 2008 Harvard Business Review article, and subsequent book, &ldquo;The Founder&rsquo;s Dilemma&rdquo; Eric Wasserman posed a thought-provoking question for business founders:  <strong>  &ldquo;Do you want to be rich or do you want to be king?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Wasserman was mostly addressing startup CEOs about the tradeoffs inherent in taking outside money, or trading equity for needed skills.  But it is a question that can be posed to founders of professional practices who are faced with challenges in reaching the next phase for their firm. The need to stay competitive, or just to reach their full vision, often means bringing in others with needed skills or merging to gain economies of scale. Getting this talent or scale often comes at the cost of giving up sole control.</p><p> <strong>  In our experience this tradeoff is not quite so binary.   </strong> There is more nuance to what drives people who build successful businesses than money or power. These include: the need for recognition, making best use of skills and talents, the opportunity for personal growth or making meaningful contributions to a community.  Understanding and integrating these other drivers is important in communication among merging partners and will help them be more resilient to setbacks.  The absence of this understanding can be the undoing of mergers and acquisitions that look so good on paper.  Those who see things only as giving up control in the quest for monetary benefits can become very stressed if those benefits take time to materialize, as they often do. Incorporating a deeper understanding of the drivers of success can temper this stress and increase the potential for the new partnership to survive, and thrive.</p><h3> If coming to deeper understanding about the tradeoffs among partners were easy, the statistics on partnership failure would not be so grim: as many as 70% fail within ten years. What is most alarming about this statistic is that the single biggest cause of failure in start-up partnerships, according to a study by Funders and Founders, is attributable to conflict among partners (62%). </h3><p> <br/> There are tools, exercises and expertise that prospective partners can take advantage of to give more substance and clarity to the &ldquo;softer&rdquo; issues. It&rsquo;s clearly a mission-critical part of merger success and until more attention is given to it, the dismal statistics are unlikely to change.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

I crawled into bed and entered reading heaven.</p><p> Turkle is Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT. Trained as a sociologist and licensed clinical psychologist, Turkle has spent the last 30 years studying the psychology of people&rsquo;s relationships with technology.</p><p> Technology has robbed us, Turkle argues convincingly, of the art of conversation. The losses run deep. The heftiest price we pay is a pervasive erosion of empathy.</p><p> I confess, I value my social media life. LinkedIn and Twitter. Love the relationships it has yielded. Substantive ones.</p><p> And I agree with Turkle.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a ridiculously simple way of reclaiming conversation at work.</p><h3> Pick up the phone.</h3><p> <br/> Leandra Campbell, the superb Relationship Manager at my firm, came to me straight out of college. Leandra writes impeccable emails. <strong>  Picking up the phone wasn&rsquo;t Leandra&rsquo;s first impulse when engaging with a client. My coaching has been unequivocal. </strong></p><p> When you don&rsquo;t get a response in time, pick up the phone.</p><p> When it&rsquo;s a complex request, pick up the phone the first time around.</p><p> Linda Provenza, a seasoned Organizational Change Agent based in the San Francisco area, sends me a document for feedback. I instantly know what I wish to say. Instead of taking the time to formulate my feedback in an email, I request a 15-minute call.</p><h3> We pick up the phone.</h3><p> <br/> Just finished conducting a 360 feedback process for a cherished client. I want you to talk to everyone, she instructs me. Yippie. The conversations that ensue yield deft opportunities for deeper exploration. Instead of a formulaic data print-out with a few unexamined comments tossed into the mix, my client receives a glimpse of shared narratives and the pleasure of seeing their rich conversational language represented in print.</p><p> It all happened on the phone.</p><p> This is a story I hear all the time.</p><p> Jeff is so busy, I don&rsquo;t want to bother him, a colleague says to me. In the same breath this colleague bemoans the fact that she doesn&rsquo;t have a great rapport or close relationship with Jeff.</p><p> Jeff may, indeed, be busy. Jeff is also not a mind reader.</p><p> Unless you have been explicitly told that phone calls are not desired, pick up the phone.</p><p> I spent the week chatting with potential publicists to promote my upcoming book. Each publicist offers two ways of being contacted. An email address. A phone number.</p><h3> You bet I picked up the phone.</h3><p> <br/> A phone call does not necessarily a conversation make. It&rsquo;s a great place to begin.</p><p> Begin.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Maybe you&#39;re one of them. Do you feel the same way? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the financial advisors I speak with are tiring of the overuse of the term &quot;wealth management&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From tag lines to commercials and from big firms to independent practitioners, it seems every sector of the financial services industry wants to find a way to get into the wealth management business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>I believe this is a very worthy goal. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>And though the terminology, at least from a popular perspective, is relatively new, most of the true professionals I know have been managing wealth for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a stockbroker, financial planner, insurance specialist or banker, your commitment to helping clients accumulate, grow, protect and transfer wealth means you are practicing wealth management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you produce fees or commissions or have salary and bonus compensation, your ability to take complex financial needs and translate them into personally tailored client solutions makes you a wealth manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming you accept this brief argument for defining your work as wealth management, you are on your way to overcoming the stigma of this overused term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the decision to formally take on this business model means analyzing both the way you execute your client management process and the words you use articulate your value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This strategy could put you on track to grow your practice because you will find many opportunities to deepen your existing relationships and attract new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This strategy could put you on track to grow your practice because you will find many opportunities to deepen your existing relationships and attract new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>To get started, here are my 10 simple ways to build a successful wealth management practice you love. </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some advisors may be able to quickly move through most of them and focus only on those that will make a big difference. Others may need to diligently work through all of them, so it will take longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, this transition is not something you need to rush. Simply review the steps, prioritize them and work with your team to settle on realistic timeframes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your commitment to transition will almost immediately bring new business opportunities, even before you complete the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s dig in...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1) Understand your current role - To begin the process of understanding your role as a wealth manager, you need to define your view of wealth management.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe wealth management is an approach to running your business as well as a process for establishing lifelong relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are helping high net worth clients establish personal financial goals and then working with them to develop and implement solutions that enable them to reach those goals and live comfortably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It encompasses wealth accumulation, growth, protection and transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A comprehensive financial planner may already embrace this entire process making their role very clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you specialize in asset allocation, investments, insurance or other subsets of wealth management, this definition may seem too broad or be beyond the scope of your current capabilities, but don&#39;t let this deter you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advisors who are comfortable with their specialty roles merely need to decide how they will leverage their expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>2) Outline your process -- All successful wealth managers have an easily understandable and repeatable process for addressing current and future client needs.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This process moves from discovery and agreement through solution development and implementation and finishes with monitoring and review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this step, you need to settle on your resources for gathering facts, crunching the data and presenting your recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you define your role as that of a comprehensive planner, you might use your own software tools and do all of this work in-house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if you are a specialist, you may need to draw on outsourced support to round out the process that is included in your specialty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>3) Compose your team -- With an understanding of your role and process, you now need to build or refine your wealth management team.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Composed of your existing staff and external resources, your team should be designed to augment your strengths whether you are a financial planner or a specialist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>External resources could range from home office support to strategic product providers to local legal and tax professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responsibilities include administration, sales and marketing, professional services and client care. You may task yourself and individual members of your team with multiple roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key is to be sure that all bases of your wealth management process are covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>4) Decide on your compensation model -- Choosing how you want to be paid as a wealth manager could arguably be handled as an earlier step.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>But to my way of thinking, roles, process and team will ultimately determine your effectiveness in serving high net worth clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you have your integrity in place, the way you choose to be paid is almost irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fee, commission, professional service and combination models all have their places and can lead to client-focused as well as profitable practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately you need to be comfortable in explaining compensation so that it is clear to your clients and prospects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The 2 most important components of ongoing education are consistency and the ability to turn it into new business opportunities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>5) Commit to ongoing education -- Though professional designations are worthwhile, they are not necessarily determinants of your qualifications as a wealth manager.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2 most important components of ongoing education are consistency and the ability to turn it into new business opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you strive to build your professionalism, your process and team (internal and external) will allow you to build appropriate client solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, your commitment to constant professional growth will allow you to recognize situations that will lead to more business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education for education&#39;s sake is helpful, but education that leads to more business through better client solutions will give you a sustaining practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>6) Articulate your value -- A personal and team understanding of your wealth management process is essential, but unless you have the ability to clearly articulate the value your process brings to your client relationships you will be finished before you get started.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Products, services, software and strategic relationships are all intricate components of your wealth management equation, but how you tell your story will make a tremendous difference in winning and keeping lifelong relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, you provide the value and this is what your clients and prospects need to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful wealth mangers make sure their clients are fully aware of their capabilities and constantly look for opportunities to educate prospective clients on the value of their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both my one-on-one and group coaching programs for advisors, I work through a process for creating simple written and oral tools that help articulate this value and then develop strategies for putting them to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a future article I&#39;ll share insights for developing your Unique Selling Proposition(USP) so stay tuned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>7) Define your ideal client relationship -- Once you are able to clearly articulate your value, you need to be sure you are telling your story to the right people.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your wealth management practice should not be a one size fits all business. Though your process will work well for many types of high net worth investors, you more than likely have client relationships that are both more enjoyable and profitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I call these your ideal client relationships. Successful wealth managers segment these relationships in order that they may better service and clone them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your current ideal clients probably account for 70 to 90 percent of your revenues and may represent less than 25 percent of your relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more time you spend with them, making sure they understand the nature of your wealth advisory practice, the greater the likelihood of new business from cross-selling, new assets and referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your business grows even though you end up spending more time with fewer people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your current clientele is not sufficient enough to support the future growth you envision, your ideal client definition will enable you to tightly define target markets that contain investors who look like them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a definition of an ideal client is a pre-requisite for the next 2 steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The successful wealth manager understands this potential and systematically positions their practice to deepen existing client relationships.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>8) Deepen existing client relationships -- To my way of thinking, most successful advisors have all the clients they need and a wealth management mindset will help ensure this reality.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I say this because I know that even in the most efficient wealth management practices there is an ongoing opportunity to capture new business and strategic referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New business that may come from the capture of assets not yet created, financial lifecycle progression and many other circumstances that unfold with time and the right type of clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, existing clients are the wealth manager&#39;s best source of referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful wealth manager understands this potential and systematically positions their practice to deepen existing client relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My 6 Step Encore Advisor Coaching Process encourages these activities by showing advisors how to constantly profile their clients and turn them into advocates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Profiling is regularly asking simple questions in different ways with the goal of uncovering new business opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In turn, well coordinated profiling leads to client advocacy; the processes of letting your ideal client know how important they are to your practice and showing them how to give you natural referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>9) Systematize client acquisition -- I recognize that many advisors practices have not been managed in a fashion that will lead to an easy wealth management transition; they cannot leverage their current clientele.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is generally the result of scattered target markets or a very narrow client management process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this is the case, creating a systematic approach to client acquisition is a priority. I am not suggesting random, high volume prospecting techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your value proposition and ideal client in mind, you develop professional and highly targeted campaigns to which you can commit yourself for an extended period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In working with advisors to develop client acquisition strategies, I find that connection style and permission based campaigns work best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both strategies involve targeting highly selected groups of potential clients and demonstrating, as professionally as possible, the benefits of adapting a relationship with a wealth advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though these tend to be slower, more deliberate approaches the end result is a well-qualified client who clearly appreciates the advisor&#39;s client management process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>10) Establish a service model -- A great deal of research has been done over the past few years on the service expectations of high net worth clients.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line to all of this analysis is the desire on the part of the client for frequent, personalized communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful wealth management practices have disciplined communication strategies that are epitomized by service models that each of their clients thoroughly understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you build or refine your wealth management model be sure to include standards for client service that are understood by your clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model should re-enforce your role and that of the other members of your team, it is part of your process and helps deepen relationships as well as find new ideal clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your service model becomes in a very tangible way your mechanism for frequent and personal communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To take it a step further, many successful wealth advisors extend a modified version of their service model communication to future clients as the perfect way to articulate their value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There you have it, 10 simple ways to build a successful wealth management practice you love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are starting from scratch or refining your approach, you should not do it just because it sounds good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A true wealth manager builds a sustaining practice of loyal clients who have entrusted them with helping accomplish long-term goals - very important work for financial professionals who take it seriously. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me know how I can help.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  Does your financial follow the Fiduciary Standard or the Suitability Standard? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t know the answer without peeking &ndash; or calling your Lifeline &ndash; you&rsquo;re not alone. A surprising number of people don&rsquo;t know what these very important terms mean and whether their advisor is acting in their best interest.</p><p> Aren&rsquo;t all financial advisors required to act in their client&rsquo;s best interest?</p><h3> <strong>  Surprisingly, not all financial advisors are. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Broker-dealers, insurance salesman, and bank and financial company representatives, for instance, are only required to follow a Suitability Standard. That means they must provide recommendations that are &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for a client &ndash; based on age for instance, or aversion to risk &ndash; but that may or may not be in that client&rsquo;s best interest.</p><p> Having a waiter recommend an expensive chocolate cake that is &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for adults and for someone who is willing to risk trying chocolate with sea salt may not be that critical, in spite of the fact that having fresh strawberries may clearly be in your best interest. But having a financial advisor who is making recommendations primarily based on your age and risk tolerance &ndash; and who could be putting their own, or their company&rsquo;s, financial interests ahead of your interests &mdash; could be disastrous for your financial future.</p><h3> Instead, the Fiduciary Standard, which is the standard for registered investment advisors under state and federal regulations, requires that a financial advisor act solely in a client&rsquo;s best interest when offering financial advice.</h3><p> <br/> Registered Investment Advisors &ndash; like Sherman Wealth Management &ndash; must follow &ndash; and are held to &ndash; the Fiduciary Standard. That means that a RIA must put their client&rsquo;s needs ahead of their own, provide fully-disclosed, conflict-free advice, be fully transparent about fees, and continue to monitor a client&rsquo;s investments, as well as their changing financial situation.</p><h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s a potential scenario that illustrates the differences </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s say your broker-dealer has three possible funds to recommend to you. The first is a &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; index fund, offered by her own company, which pays her a 6% commission on the sale and charges a 2% annual fee. The second is a similarly suitable index fund that would pay her a 3% commission on the sale and has a 1% annual fee. The third is an index fund that has no sales commission and an annual fee of .5%. Under the Suitability Standard, she can recommend the higher priced fund and still satisfy the standard. Under the Fiduciary Standard, she would be required to recommend the third fund.</p><p> This is not to suggest that broker-dealers or others operating under the Suitability Standard don&rsquo;t look out for their clients.  While many reps who follow the Suitability Standard give their clients excellent advice, they operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest.</p><p> So go ahead and let the waiter talk you into that chocolate cake (even though you know you&rsquo;ll feel better tomorrow if you have the strawberries.) <strong>  But when it comes to your money, think carefully about whose advice you are taking. </strong></p><p> ***</p><a href=\"http://www.finra.org/investors/suitability-what-investors-need-know\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.finra.org/investors/suitability-what-investors-need-know</a><br/><a href=\"http://financialplanningcoalition.com/issues/fiduciary-standard-of-care/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://financialplanningcoalition.com/issues/fiduciary-standard-of-care/</a><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?  &mdash; 1998 Rush Hour movie starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker</p><p> How many times have you been in a situation where you were trying to communicate with someone and it felt you might as well have been talking to the wall? I remember explaining a concept to a client using a PowerPoint and the client didn&rsquo;t hear a word I said because he was focused on how he didn&rsquo;t like the color scheme on the slide.</p><h3> 60% of communications fail because communication styles and preferences are not aligned. Based upon 1999 Stanford Research study.</h3><p> <br/> Our brains are hard-wired to process information and learn a certain way. Most people accept this by now due to the volume of research on the topic. However, we can learn how to adapt to different communication styles to increase our effectiveness.</p><h3> Sales increased 17% just by a salesperson mimicking the communication style of a potential customer.  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/01/monkey-see-monkey-buy/ar/1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u></h3><p> <br/> Our research has identified that most people have one of 4  <u>  primary communication styles </u> : <strong>  Goal-Setting, Lifestyle, Stability and Information. </strong> There is a lot you can learn about people and how their brain processes information:</p><li> Learning Style</li><li> Communication Preferences</li><li> Information needs for Decision-making</li><p> <br/> <img alt=\"\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Iceberg-picture1.jpg\" width=\"513\"/></p><p> With this knowledge, you can make some simple adjustments to how you approach a person to help them absorb the information, understand why your communicating and ensure they take away the points you feel are important (the ability to influence them.)</p><h3> 8 Simple Tips to Adapt Your Communication Style for Others:</h3><p> <br/> If you are interacting with a Goal-Setter primary communication type:</p><p> <strong>  1. Start with the End Goal in Mind </strong>  &ndash; What is the purpose of the interaction and how does it connect to your audience&rsquo;s goal (what&rsquo;s in it for them?) Use bullets and executive summaries to convey more information with fewer words. Details can be provided after the summary if needed, but Goal-setters don&rsquo;t read long emails/blogs or sit through long presentations.</p><p> <strong>  2. Provide Options </strong>  &ndash; If you only give them one recommendation or option, you will most likely get pushback or a &ldquo;no.&rdquo; They want to be able to make a choice. They will likely want to discuss it.</p><p> If you are interacting with a Lifestyle primary communication type:</p><p> <strong>  3. Explain Who is Involved </strong>  &mdash; Being more relationship-focused, their brains first have to understand who is involved, their role, how they fit into the discussion and what they may think about it. They also respond well to social events and informal communication methods.</p><p> <strong>  4. Use Visuals </strong>  &ndash; Rather than send a long email or written instructions use a picture, infographic or demo to better help their brains process the information and retain it. They need to experience it to learn.</p><p> If you are interacting with a Stability primary communication type:</p><p> <strong>  5. How You Say It Matters </strong>  &ndash; The right tone is especially important for this group. They prefer supportive and low-risk interactions and solutions. Email may not be the best choice, but if you do send an email, be very careful to consider them as a person and how they might perceive it or &ldquo;feel&rdquo; about it.</p><p> <strong>  6. Slow Down and Reassure </strong>  &ndash; They like to be thorough and appreciate step-by-step instructions. They want to be very comfortable and sure of their actions before they act.</p><p> If you are interacting with an Information primary communication type:</p><p> <strong>  7. Stick to the facts </strong>  &ndash; They prefer to primarily focus on tasks/results and do not necessarily want a lot of social interactions. They tend to be logical, want to &ldquo;get to the truth,&rdquo; and understand &ldquo;why,&rdquo; therefore, they are more comfortable when they have more details, information, and research.</p><p> <strong>  8. Don&rsquo;t Try Appealing to their Emotional Side </strong>  &ndash; I repeat, stick to the facts, policies and procedures, and the logical explanation. If you try to sway them with name-dropping, leverage office politics, oversell a concept with marketing hype or appeal to their emotional side, you will actually repel them, not influence them.</p><p> What&rsquo;s your  <u>  communication style </u> ? </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/kforst/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kelly Frost  </u> </a></p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research from Cisco  </a> </u> , video will drive 80 percent of all consumer internet traffic by 2019 &ndash; up from 64 percent in 2014. At the same time, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://brandlift.vizu.com/knowledge-resources/research/pdf/2012%20Online%20Brand%20Advertising%20Outlook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nielsen company study  </a> </u>  reports that 57 percent of marketers are increasing their spending to include video in their marketing strategy. So, what can a growth-minded financial services firm do to capitalize on this trend in their marketing and PR efforts?</p><p> Whether you are running an RIA firm, launching a new ETF or trying to drive credibility around your firm&rsquo;s service capabilities, the challenge is clear: If video is so important for the future of marketing, how can we engage with maximum impact?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with the on-camera interview setting, where most of today&rsquo;s media focuses its content generation. The reality is sitting down in front of the camera is tricky business. You&rsquo;re focusing on your appearance and demeanor, staring into the camera, making sure your eyes don&rsquo;t shift and matching your pace to the anchor&rsquo;s, but you&rsquo;re also reciting your firm&rsquo;s position on a news development, messages you&rsquo;d like clients to hear and maybe key differentiators. It needs to be right the first time; there&rsquo;s no second try in live broadcasting.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve talked about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/industry-trends/6-epic-fails-of-a-cnbc-appearance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   epic fails of a television appearance  </a> </u>  before, but how can you make sure you&rsquo;re capitalizing on this highly sought-after and competitive media opportunity? Here are four tips from our playbook to help you through your first appearance.</p><h3> 1. Speak directly to your audience. </h3><p> Is your audience made up of sophisticated, high-net-worth investors or consumers with little understanding of market intricacies? How about fellow financial advisors? Whoever it is you&rsquo;re trying to reach, make sure you focus on delivering your message to that group and stick with them. For example, Eric Tom, a financial advisor with the MetLife Premier Client Group, did just that in a video he filmed for InvestmentNews. Not only does he appear engaged and energetic right off the bat, but Eric acknowledges and speaks directly to his audience of young financial advisors throughout the segment.</p><h3> 2. Know (and stay on) your message. </h3><p> Prepare three key points you&rsquo;d like to address and make sure you highlight them, explain them and repeat them throughout the segment. In this clip, John Traynor, chief investment strategist at People&rsquo;s United Wealth Management,  <u>  <a href=\"http://nbr.com/2015/01/16/market-monitor-john-traynor-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   joined Nightly Business Report to discuss active versus passive investing strategies  </a> </u> . He uses examples throughout his segment to solidify his point about active money management.</p><h3> 3. Keep informed. </h3><p> Staying up to date on breaking news leading up to a TV or radio segment can prevent you from coming across as ill-informed. Take 15 minutes before the segment to scan top headlines to make sure you&rsquo;re prepared for anything before sitting down in front of the camera, especially as it relates to your place in business. Take a lesson from Phil Noftsinger, president of CBIZ Payroll, and his  <u>  <a href=\"http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/4163714250001/small-businesses-creating-more-employment-opportunities/?#sp=show-clips\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   appearance on FOX Business  </a> </u> , during which he discusses that morning&rsquo;s release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Employment Situation report. Familiarizing yourself with news of the day and weaving it into your commentary will enhance your message and position you as a subject matter expert within your industry.</p><h3> 4. Be the face of your firm.</h3><p> You are your firm&rsquo;s brand when you&rsquo;re on air. If you fumble and stutter, any credibility could be dismissed by your audience in a matter of minutes. However, the flip side is also true. Having a polished and practiced presence on air strengthens your argument and showcases your organization&rsquo;s expertise. Take for example, our client Mark Matson, CEO and founder of Matson Money. Mark is a quick-witted, savvy and conversant television personality, and it reflects well on him and his firm. In a  <u>  recent appearance on FOX Business </u> , he did a great job establishing his brand to the world.</p><p> It&rsquo;s understandable for nerves to be running high the first time you sit down in that little studio with nothing more than a camera in your face. As with many things in life, remember that practice makes perfect.</p>",

    "title": "The Importance of Communication in Family Business Transfers",
    "link": "the-importance-of-communication-in-family-business-transfers",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Another part of your job in creating an owner's written Road Map is to help the owner communicate his or her plan to all of the stakeholders. </strong>   This begins with helping owners (and their spouses) articulate their goals for the business without them and for their future without their businesses.  Once they fully understand each other's goals and have agreed upon their joint goals, you help them communicate those views to all of their children (both active and not active in the business), and perhaps to other stakeholders (sons- and daughters-in-law, for example).</p><p> It is critical that both owners/parents first understand what they need and want from the business, for the business and for their families before diving into family deliberations.  Beth Adamson, Co-Founder of Midwest Family Business Alliance and former director of a family business center (more on centers below), agrees:  \"Whether in the home or in the business, it is critical for mom and dad to be on the same page.  I've had clients whose adult children do everything they can to make parents choose sides, or try to influence one or the other parent, especially when they see that their parents are not communicating as partners.  It's one thing to behave this way within the family system, but when it spills over into the business system, it can have a devastating impact.\"</p><h3> <strong>  One Exit-Planning advisor learned about the importance of this initial communication between the parents the hard way. </strong></h3><p> <br/> My phone rang early on January 2.  It was Frank, an owner who had gifted, with my help, some of his business interest to his son.  His first words were not, \"Happy New Year!\" but \"Undo that gift!\"</p><p> Six weeks earlier Frank, Sr. (Senior) had given his youngest son, Frank, Jr. (Junior), part of the business interest.  Junior not only ran the business with his dad but had become more important to the company's success than Senior.  For that reason, Senior had decided to gift a significant part of the very successful business to Junior. </p><p> Senior arrived later on the day he'd called--about 20 minutes early--for a hastily arranged appointment.  Suspecting that Senior might be just a little agitated, I asked, \"What has you so upset about the gifting?\"</p><p> Senior's answer poured out, \"Jean and I had all four kids and 11 grandchildren over to the house for a holiday dinner.  My oldest daughter, Linda, noticed that Junior's kid had on a pair of red Jordan Super Fly basketball shoes.  You know, the $190-a-pair shoes?\"</p><p> Before I could answer, Frank went on, \"Linda then cornered Jean in the kitchen and told her that her kids couldn't help clear the table because they were too embarrassed to be seen in their $29 sneakers from Target.  Linda then complained that since Frank Jr. was now earning more than he could ever have hoped to outside the business, 'This is beyond unfair!'\"</p><p> Senior continued, \"At this point, I walked into the kitchen--now a hornets' nest of moral outrage.  I was prepared to face the 'you always liked him best' routine.  I reminded Linda that I'd offered her (and her sisters) the same opportunity to work in the business, but they'd all chosen different paths.  I told her that her brother was responsible for increasing the value and cash flow of the company--something he'd done working 60 hours a week!\"</p><p> \"That wasn't good enough for either one of them!\" explained Frank.  \"Somehow I have not only violated some unspoken Family Code, but now Jean isn't speaking to me!\"</p><p> As I listened, I realized that Senior blamed me and expected me to extract him from this mess.  He wanted me to right the ship of marital bliss by ensuring that all his children felt that he treated them equally.</p><p> And he was right.  It was my fault--for not requiring that Jean be present at the meeting during which we discussed gifting to Junior.</p><h3> <strong>  Frank and his advisor had paved the road to family conflict with good intentions. </strong></h3><h3> <br/> A Communication Plan</h3><p> <br/> The communication path that the advisor should have created would not only have avoided problems, but facilitated the entire planning process.  His action list should have included:</p><li> <strong>  Include both parents/spouses in all meetings, especially those dealing with goal creation.  </strong> If both parents are not communicating fully and openly, they will never get to the first step of jointly agreeing on their Exit Planning goals.</li><li> <strong>  Facilitate the planning meeting by asking the \"questions behind the question.\"  </strong> If the active owner--in our example Frank--expresses that he'd like to \"get out of the business in five years,\" the advisor's role is to probe further:  does Frank want to retire completely?  Transfer the entire business by then?  Or begin to transfer the business by then?</li><li> <strong>  Listen carefully to Jean (Frank's wife). </strong>   If this transfer is to be successful, her feelings also need to be heard. <br/>  </li><p> In short, the advisor's role in the preliminary meetings is to facilitate communication between the spouses so that both understand each other's goals. </p><p> When it relates to setting goals, we suggest that advisors discuss all possible goals with both parents/spouses/owners.  The purpose is to uncover other goals the owners have that they didn't know they had.  You would be surprised how many owners don't know what they don't know simply because they haven't been exposed to the wide variety of possible goals.</p><p> A quote attributed to Henry Ford expresses this situation well, \"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\"  It's up to you to ask the probing questions.  For example, Frank's (and Jean's) Exit Planning advisor should have asked, \"Do you have any thoughts about the future conduct of the business when you are no longer running or owning it?  For example, is it important that the business...stay in your community...maintain your legacy of hiring war veterans..etc.?\"</p><h3> Family Business Centers</h3><p> <br/> We further suggest to advisors who work with family businesses that they develop a deeper understanding of communication topics, issues and resolutions through interaction with their local or regional family business centers. Attend a meeting. You&rsquo;ll quickly meet other advisors whose practice is centered on facilitating communication among family members as well as a host of other specialized family business advisors.</p><p> If you would like help in locating such a center (most are affiliated with universities), please email us and we&rsquo;ll help.</p><p> Beth Adamson lists three benefits of these centers to owners, &ldquo;First, family business owners can receive huge support from other owners who share the same challenges. Second, centers specialize in addressing the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; issues that create so much of the conflict in family-owned businesses. Third, these centers maintain extensive networks of local advisors who are well-versed in family issues and solutions.&rdquo;</p><p> Perhaps your most important initial role in engaging and representing family business owners is to encourage and facilitate communication first between spouses, and then the entire family. Your clients will benefit and you will avoid a &ldquo;Frank disaster.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  We should sell off or sack &ldquo;C&rdquo; grade clients, shouldn&rsquo;t we? </strong></p><p> Maybe not&hellip;.there just might be a better way&hellip;.</p><p> The arguments for getting rid of them that are continually put forward seem to be:</p><li> <strong>  They don&rsquo;t appear to present growth opportunities for our practice. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They are unprofitable. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They are a bit transactional, and we don&rsquo;t really have a fabulous relationship. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They are obviously doing a fair bit of their business elsewhere, because they aren&rsquo;t doing it with us&hellip;. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> All of these things might be true, BUT, none of these arguments take into account a reasonably important angle:</p><h3> <strong>  Did we check to see if the problem is us? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The clients don&rsquo;t appear to be potential growth clients&hellip;.the key word is &ldquo;appear&rdquo;.  Do we really know if they are or aren&rsquo;t?</p><p> The clients are transactional: could it be because that is the only way we have ever dealt with them? Just tried to sell them something?</p><p> Perhaps they are doing business elsewhere that we could have done&hellip;.the key word is &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t it?  We don&rsquo;t really know&hellip;</p><p> Finally: they are unprofitable. Well that is definitely the advisers fault.  Customers don&rsquo;t make themselves unprofitable, we do.  The demarkation line on that one is straightforward: customers bring in an amount of revenue; we decide how much expenditure we will incur servicing them.  So to make them profitable all we have to do is service them differently.</p><p> Been there, done that.  Some years ago now my practice went through a very lengthy exercise with a large client base to try and determine where we were making money, and where we were being poor business people.  The results were astounding&hellip;although I guess they shouldn&rsquo;t have been.  We had made the classic mistake of delivering essentially the same service level to all clients, albeit with a bit of extra personal attention and TLC to our A clients.  But pretty much every client got the same engagement process, and we went through the same review process &ndash; or tried to &ndash; and everyone got invited to everything.</p><p> The result of all the segmentation and analysis for the C clients was something like they cost us $121 each per year to service, and on average presented $70 in revenue.</p><p> Whose fault was that?  It sure wasn&rsquo;t the client&rsquo;s fault. It was ours.  We got our delivery wrong for those people.  They are valuable if we get our costs right.</p><h3> <strong>  Cut Your Losses NOW! </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  This is the point where I received a lot of advice to sell the C clients to stop bleeding cash. </strong>  At that point the capitalised value of those renewals was relatively insignificant in the great scheme of things as we could have sold the rights to renewals for about 2.5 x annual recurring income &ndash; which was not a lot.</p><p> More importantly though, I knew how hard it was getting new customers.  Expensive. Time consuming.  Some will turn out to be the new &ldquo;C&rsquo;s&rdquo; anyway.</p><p> A bit more analysing and thinking about the options resulted in a plan that ultimately ended in &ldquo;sell whoever doesn&rsquo;t engage, but give them a chance to first&rdquo;.    The strategy became:</p><h3> 1. Start again/Give Them A Chance.  </h3><p> Treat each of them as if they were a new customer, and make a concerted effort to engage in full fact finding and relationship building with each of them.</p><h3> 2. Transactional? Give them the deal they really want.  </h3><p> If clients didn&rsquo;t want to engage with us, or in the full advice process, then it makes sense to give them the deal they want &ndash; which was invariably price-driven.  So we did a deal with a supplier who guaranteed to give the best price to the clients, and then made them an offer.  Essentially it was &ldquo;this will save you 20% on your premiums forever, but if there is no advice or ongoing service as part of the package &ndash; you just get the cover you need at a price that can&rsquo;t be beaten.  You&rsquo;re then on your own.  Want it?&ldquo;</p><h3> 3. Keep the longshots, but make them profitable.  </h3><p> Some hadn&rsquo;t wanted to engage now, but didn&rsquo;t want to entirely opt out of advice, and had the potential because of their positions or careers to perhaps become more valuable clients one day.  So we changed the service levels to one of &ldquo;stay on the radar screen cost effectively, but don&rsquo;t waste personnel time on them&rdquo;.  Average servicing cost then dropped to about $25 per year per client.</p><h3> 4. Get rid of the deadwood.  </h3><p> Anyone left presented no real future, so with these it was time to cut our losses and sell.</p><h3> <strong>  The results from following this plan were pretty spectacular actually. </strong></h3><p> <br/> We started with something like 2,000 clients identified as being low value, and managed to re-engage with over 100 of them and turn them into proper &ldquo;advice clients&rdquo;.  That was, in real terms, 100 new clients for the firm.  Not a great percentage perhaps, but we&rsquo;ll take a hundred new clients anytime.</p><p> <strong>  The transactional were really astounding. </strong>  Over the course of about 6 months or so we literally sold an alternative price-driven solution to about 600 clients.  We had just capitalised their &ldquo;exit value&rdquo; at 6 times more than we would have got by selling them, and had completely re-positioned our relationship with them. No ongoing service or advice obligations, and they had left happy customers.</p><h3> A few hundred more were kept on, but were now being seen more as &ldquo;prospects&rdquo; than clients and they were paying their own way while we waited patiently.</h3><p> <br/> We ended up selling about a thousand clients, but had satisfied ourselves that they really were people who presented no significant value to our business, and who in turn didn&rsquo;t particularly value us.  Along the way though we got busy doing good work with more people who were valuing us, the firm made some good money as we went through the exercise, and the long term bottom line got a lot healthier. Customers were happier&hellip;and so were our staff.</p>",

For example, imagine that a wealthy elderly woman and her adult daughter are traveling together on a small plane. The elderly lady has two children (the daughter and an adult son) but no  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   will  </a> </u> . <strong>  The daughter has no money and no job but does have a will that names her tattoo artist as the sole beneficiary of her estate. </strong></p><p> In an unfortunate turn of events, the small plane crashes into a mountain and all the passengers are scattered on the mountainside. If the daughter dies first, then her estate has no value and the tattoo-artist therefore inherits nothing. If the rich elderly woman dies first AND the daughter lives for at least another 120 hours, then the daughter inherits from the mother and when the daughter dies then the daughter&rsquo;s estate passes to the tattoo artist.</p><p> However, if the daughter doesn&rsquo;t live for at least 120 hours, then she is treated as if she  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predeceased\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   predeceased  </a> </u>  the elderly woman.

For example, a will could contain language that expands the 120-hour survival requirement to 200 hours, 30 days, 60 days, etc.</p><p> In some unusual circumstances, it is unclear whether a beneficiary predeceased a testator. This was a more common event in years past when communications technology was not as advanced as it is today (e.g., unreported shipwrecks) but it is still possible. For example, a testator and beneficiary might be involved in an extreme disaster (such as a  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami\" target=\"_blank\">   tsunami  </a> </u> ) in a remote location and they might not be recovered for over 120 hours. In those circumstances, the law does not presume either adequate or inadequate survival time. Rather, anyone making a claim (say the tattoo artist) must demonstrate that the beneficiary survived at least 120 hours.</p>",

    "title": "Your Bank Has Sent You A Friend Request",
    "link": "your-bank-has-sent-you-a-friend-request",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The banking crisis of five years ago left the image of banks in tatters. The PPI claims, the controversial charges, and all the headlines placing the blame of the UK recession firmly at the feet of city bankers, are not easily forgotten. While not entirely unjust in some cases, this perception has undoubtedly been difficult for the banks to shake off, and the industry is in dire need of a facelift. As banks try to restore faith in their customers, the more enlightened ones have realised that the market has moved on. We can no longer use the messages of old to rebuild reputations.</p><h3> <strong>  I can buy a can of beans after 5pm </strong></h3><p> <br/> Thinking back to &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; bank marketing, we might remember high interest rates headlining adverts to encourage savers, or lower mortgage rates to encourage borrowers. These transaction-based messages focused on the net financial result of choosing one bank over another, and were successful for a time.</p><p> More recently, faced with a stagnant market, banks moved away from transactional sales pitches, turning instead to messages that promised better customer service. But some of these customer service based messages (and offerings) came too late, failing to resonate with modern customers who were accustomed to living in a 24 hour society. If people are used to being able to buy a can of baked beans in the early hours at a 24 hour supermarket, why would they be impressed that their bank is open after 5pm or over the weekend? It should be a given, rather than an outstanding feature to headline an ad campaign.</p><h3> <strong>  Proteins, the building blocks of life and brands </strong></h3><p> <br/> Consumers are becoming brand savvy. They know and interact with brands who give them fantastic customer service, who take them on a journey and become a part of their lives. Even the least likely of brands are now picking up on and embracing this change in customer mood. For example, I am a big fan of the brand engagement activity of an incumbent company established in 1977 in the health and fitness industry (Universal Nutrition&rsquo;s &lsquo;Animal&rsquo; brand). They have mastered the art of social media engagement, with compelling mini-movies featuring fans and sponsored athletes. I recently shared an example of their work on my Facebook. The choice of music, production quality of the YouTube videos, and the exchanges they have inspired on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, have netted them a loyal and engaged community of fans (aka customers).</p><p> Bear in mind this is a company that sells dried milk and egg (protein) powders. If a brand selling tubs of dried milk powder can express empathy and establish authentic engagement, I am certain the same can be true of the banks &ndash; after all, they enable some of the biggest emotional decisions of our lives such as buying a home, planning for retirement, launching a business, and helping us through tough times.</p><h3> <strong>  Adding value by consolidation </strong></h3><p> <br/> Apple is the poster-child for brand advocacy and fan-based customer communities. They have deployed a strategy to embed themselves in to the everyday lives of their customers and tie them to the brand. For many of us it started with a phone. Then when we wanted a tablet, it made sense to opt for an iPad so that our devices would work together. And so it goes on - we buy apps through the Apple Store, a Mac instead of a PC, and when in the market for a smart watch, we all know which one will be strapped to our wrist - why consider another brand when we stand to lose so much in experience? We are tied to the ecosystem, and most of us realise this and actually love the brand because of it. Apple&rsquo;s customers are happy to go with the flow because they know and understand the products, value the service they will receive, and most importantly, trust Apple to deliver.</p><p> The same tactics could be applied by banks, but so far they have largely failed to do so. Unless there is a value in having multiple financial products (such as current account, mortgage, and savings accounts) held by the same bank, people will no longer do so. What the banks need to do is figure out a way to do what Apple has done and offer products and services that enhance each other. Loyalty should pay, and banks need to offer motivation for customers to consolidate all their financial products with one provider. For this to happen, both the product propositions and the user experience with the brand across all their products are equally important.</p><h3> <strong>  The John Lewis effect </strong></h3><p> <br/> A sure sign that banks are responding to the need to make more meaningful relationships with their customers is the plethora of emotive TV commercials they are currently putting on our screens. Indeed, you might be forgiven for mistaking some current banks&rsquo; TV ads for mini-dramas. From nostalgia to tear-jerkers, the current trend focuses firmly on emotive connections, a strategy far removed from the traditional transactional messages we have come to expect from banks.</p><p> These TV ads show a desire for the &lsquo;John Lewis effect&rsquo; &ndash; the banks hope that an emotional response to an advert will be transferred to the brand. In this approach, I believe authenticity is key, especially when exposed to the raw critique of social media. Openness will create the brand of the future, with robust and trusting relationships that benefit both parties. Emotive advertising is not enough &ndash; it may make customers take notice, but unless it is backed up by consistently authentic customer experience along with a real incentive for customers to consolidate financial products with one provider, it will only take the banks so far.When we openly show our heart, customers might drop their scepticism and accept the friend request. </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you could wave a magic wand and suddenly make every employee in your organization proficient in one behavior what would that be? Critical thinking? Customer-orientation? Sales?</p><p> No matter which behavior I consider, I&rsquo;m hard pressed to come up with one that would be more impactful with just a bit more listening.</p><p> <strong>  Listening transforms relationships. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Listening makes customers feel valued. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Listening gets to root cause. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Listening attracts business. </strong></p><p> Yet, in most organizations I work with, people talk a heck more than they listen. Most of us can&rsquo;t claim that we consistently listen well.</p><p> So how do you set out to build a culture of effective listening? Start with these 7 steps.</p><h3> 1. Tell the Truth</h3><p> Nothing will make people tune out faster than smelling BS. If you want people to truly listen, be sure they can believe what you say. A culture of real listening can only happen when people can count on one another for candor. Encourage transparency and truth telling, starting at the very top.</p><h3> 2. Be Interesting</h3><p> Sounds basic, right? If you want people to listen, speak in an interesting way. Tell  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/how-to-tell-a-great-story/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  meaningful stories  </a>  Ditch the 35 page PowerPoint deck and explain why your project really matters.</p><h3> 3. Show Up Like an Anthropologist</h3><p> Anthropologists don&rsquo;t go to a scene with something to prove, they show up subtly and listen carefully. They ask great questions and make meaning from the responses. Imagine the possibilities if more executives approached their field visits with the attitude of an anthropologist. Or if more sales reps worked to truly listen to what customers were saying about their lifestyles and values.</p><h3> 4. Be Interested</h3><p> To encourage deeper listening, be a great listener. Approach conversations with empathy and compassion. Let your words, body language and actions show that you&rsquo;re very interested in who they are and what they&rsquo;re saying.</p><h3> 5. Reward Transparency</h3><p> If you freak out every time you get bad news, all you&rsquo;ll get is  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/soliciting_upward_feedback/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Diaper Genie  </a> feedback, where the poop is disguised in so much packaging you can&rsquo;t even smell it. Thank people for bringing you the truth. Surround yourself with those who will challenge your ideas. Promote those willing to speak up.</p><h3> 6. Encourage Field Trips</h3><p> One of the best ways to build a listening culture is to have encourage cross-departmental visits. Give your teams permission to visit their counterparts upstream or downstream in the process. Let them share their challenges, pressures and successes.</p><h3> 7. Get Social</h3><p> Social media provides amazing opportunities to listen to customers. A good social care strategy listen&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Social-Media/2015/05/7-Deadly-Sins-of-Social-Customer-Service\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  beyond the # and the @ </a> . Social platforms can be great for internal listening as well. One of my clients recently implemented  <a href=\"https://www.yammer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yammer a </a> nd is delighted by the informal conversations forming and how they can trend what&rsquo;s most important on people&rsquo;s minds.</p><h3> <strong>  Your turn. How do you build a culture of deeper listening? </strong></h3><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> <strong>  Perhaps one of the most ineffective ideas perpetuated in our industry is the &ldquo;elevator pitch.&rdquo; </strong></h3><h3> <br/> The idea of the elevator pitch is that you say something so unique and clever that people will want to talk to you about becoming your client. Can you envision it? <strong>  You just say the magic words and prospects clamor for your business card. It&rsquo;s so alluring that I&rsquo;ve been guilty of wanting to believe this is possible myself. </strong></h3><p> <br/> However, I have come to recognize that the key to engaging people, especially wealthy people who have lots of experience with financial advisors and institutions, is to ask great questions. Especially in that first 30 seconds &hellip; even if you are actually riding an elevator.</p><h3> <strong>  People would rather talk about themselves than listen to other people talk. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even as a cold‐ calling rookie 30 years ago, I remember that nobody hung up the phone while they were talking! And the same is true in person. People don't become bored talking with you when they are talking. People don&rsquo;t perceive you as just another typical FA while they are talking. People don&rsquo;t conclude that they already have all of their financial affairs taken care of while they are talking. People don&rsquo;t become uninterested in speaking with you while they are talking.</p><p> So what do you do if you literally have that proverbial 30 seconds in the elevator with someone who could become your next ideal client? Or more likely when you meet someone at a cocktail party or fund‐raiser? Ask a great question that gets them talking about something that is meaningful, important, significant and compelling to them. Imagine the elevator doors open, they are still talking, and they would like to continue talking to you. They will be much more receptive to your offer to continue the conversation and, eventually, to your offer to take the next step in the journey of becoming your next ideal client.</p><p> While this may seem self‐evident, very few FAs have developed this skill.</p><h3> <strong>  What kind of questions? </strong></h3><p> <br/> First of all, these are definitely not simple‐ minded conversations about the weather, sports or the news headline of the day. Nor are they questions about the person&rsquo;s money, the markets, economics or financial planning needs.</p><p> In fact, I asked the most interesting and successful people I know to send me their favorite questions and I put them together in a worksheet I&rsquo;ve included some of their contributions below:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.moneyguidepro.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kevin Knull, CFP  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;As a child, what did you want to grow up to be, and why?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me about the two friends you have that would give you 50% of the money in their checking account, no questions asked, if you told them you needed it and couldn&rsquo;t say why.&rdquo;</p><p> What are the three most pressing concerns personally right this moment?&rdquo;</p><p> If you just found out you had 30 days to live, what would you do with those last 30 days?&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.scottmckain.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Scott McKain  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the one thing you learned growing up that still impacts you today?&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.fripp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Patricia Fripp  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;How did you meet and fall in love with your spouse?&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.peterlegge.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Peter Legge  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;How did you decide to become a ______ ? What influenced that decision?&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Shep Hyken  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;What keeps you up at night?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.booher.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dianna Booher  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;It depends on where I am when I ask the question, to whom and the context&mdash;serious, private and so forth. Here are three:</p><p> &ldquo;&lsquo;Looking back, what would you say has been the happiest time in your life? Now or when you were younger? Or college days? Or just when?&rsquo; Then I follow up with, &lsquo;Why do you say that?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> (The purpose is just to get them talking enthusiastically about a happy time and to find out more about their background.)</p><p> &ldquo;The next question is, &lsquo;What one thing are you most excited about in your business these days?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> (The purpose is to find out more about the person&rsquo;s business, learn new ideas&mdash;and particularly what they are passionate about.)</p><p> The next question, she says is, &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other for a very long time. There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t recall ever having talked about &hellip; where do you stand on spiritual issues? Heaven forbid and you didn&rsquo;t wake up tomorrow morning and God asked why he should let you into heaven, what would your answer be?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> (The purpose of this is to determine spiritual understanding and see if the person is willing to talk about spiritual matters, possibly opening the door for a deeper conversation about what the Bible says about how a person can have a personal relationship with God on Earth.)</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.alessandra.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Tony Alessandra  </u> </a>  </p><p> &ldquo;Tell me a bit about your business?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What kinds of activities do you like to do outside of work?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What are the top three business concerns you&rsquo;re facing today?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What opportunities from us, or your competitors, do you see as being missed or overlooked?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What are your thoughts on how the changes and trends in your industry will affect your current and future business?&rdquo;</p><p> The goal of asking questions like these is to move people a step closer to possibly becoming your client without feeling like you are selling, convincing or persuading. It&rsquo;s all about them.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You may be surprised to learn that \"Ira\" is not one of the most popular baby names of 2015. Yeah... we weren't either. <strong>  But, these three little letters, when capitalized, should become much more attractive to you and your future: IRA.   </strong></p><h3> What Is An IRA?</h3><p> An IRA is an Individual Retirement Account that allows you to save for retirement and receive tax advantages. As long as you&rsquo;re under the age of 70.5 and you or your spouse earned income this year, you can save to an IRA. There are two types of IRAs and the major tax perk of both is tax-deferral. Unlike a regular investment account, there will be no income tax liability on the earnings generated by the investments in an IRA, which means your savings can compound faster.</p><h3> What Are The Types of IRAs?</h3><p> The two types of IRAs are Traditional and Roth. While the tax-deferral feature is the same for both, contributions and withdrawals are treated differently. </p><h3> Traditional IRA</h3><p> if eligible, you may receive an income tax deduction for contributions. The tradeoff for this up-front tax deduction is that distributions, including earnings, will be taxed as ordinary income. Unfortunately, you won't be able to kick the tax can down the road forever. The IRS requires minimum distributions be taken each year, beginning at age 70.5.</p><h3> Roth IRA</h3><p> if you are eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, you will not receive an income tax deduction for contributions. The upside is that contributions can be withdrawn tax-free at any time and distributions of earnings may also be tax-free. In order to take tax-free distributions of earnings, you must be at least 59.5 and your initial contribution must have been made at least 5 years prior to the date of the distribution. There are no minimum distribution requirements at age 70.5 (can, kicked!)</p><h3> How Much Can I Contribute?</h3><p> The maximum IRA contribution limit for 2015 is $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50+).  Your total IRA contributions for the year - to Traditional, Roth or a combination of both - cannot exceed these limits. Also, contributions cannot exceed your income for the year (for example, a college student with $4k in wages may only make a $4k contribution). </p><h3> What's All This \"if you are eligible\" Talk?</h3><p> Although you may always contribute to a Traditional IRA - provided you&rsquo;re under age 70.5 and you or your spouse earned income in the year - you may not receive a tax deduction for the full contribution amount. Also, your income may affect your eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA all together.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Jeremy Levinn </u></p><p> If there&rsquo;s a common thread among nearly every person I talk to, it&rsquo;s an unfortunate one:   People are getting bad financial advice.   No, TERRIBLE advice.  That is, if they&rsquo;re getting advice at all.  Let&rsquo;s be clear:  selling an annuity or insurance product only counts as &ldquo;advice&rdquo; in the context of my profession.  We do not call the guy selling you a car a &ldquo;vehicle advisor&rdquo;; the person giving the time-share presentation is not a &ldquo;vacation property advisor&rdquo;.  They are SELLING.  Which is fine &ndash; there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with selling.</p><p> Unless you disguise a sales pitch as advice and the public doesn&rsquo;t have the knowledge or understanding to tell the difference. </p><p> I recently met with a 40-year-old couple who were on the verge of being sold (by a very aggressive salesman) an expensive long-term care policy.   Did they need the coverage?  When I asked this question, and the couple couldn&rsquo;t easily answer, they started to see the problem.  There was no connection between their needs and the insurance they were about to buy.  Icing on the cake:  the salesman was pushing a variable annuity to accompany the insurance policy, in order to fund the premiums.  What were the fees?  What were the investment choices?  Nothing disclosed, save promises of rainbows, unicorns, and tax-free withdrawals.</p><p> Another couple, older, was sold variable annuities with total fees of  <u>  3.6% PER YEAR </u> .  It took us hours to figure out the total costs, combing through the plan prospectus and adding everything up, after neither the annuity company nor the broker would tell them anything.</p><p> A couple with pre-teen children had their kids&rsquo; college savings in custodial accounts in the kids&rsquo; names.   Those assets count heavily against financial aid and become the unrestricted assets of the child at age 21.  Does this mean it&rsquo;s the wrong choice?  Not necessarily, but the couple was unaware of the implications.</p><p> I could go on and on.  The couple with multiple rental properties, the properties in their names, and no commercial homeowner&rsquo;s insurance &ndash; a liability disaster in the making.</p><p> The couple with their life savings in four stocks.</p><p> The woman with her life savings in ONE stock.</p><p> If I had to draw a single lesson from my experiences of the past year, it&rsquo;s this:</p><p> <u>  You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know </u> .</p><p> None of these people are stupid.  But none of them have expertise in the multiple areas of financial planning.  Why would they?  They are attorneys, teachers, and journalists.  I can&rsquo;t draft my own contracts, create a lesson plan, or write long-form journalism.</p><p> The consequences of poor planning can be disastrous, in part because it&rsquo;s only discovered once it&rsquo;s too late.  The concentrated stock position isn&rsquo;t a problem until the stock price plummets; the high fees aren&rsquo;t noticeable until you reach retirement and you don&rsquo;t have enough money; inadequate liability insurance isn&rsquo;t a problem until you are faced with a financially ruinous lawsuit.</p><p> So in the case of financial planning, &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply.   In all likelihood, there is plenty that is &ldquo;broke,&rdquo; or could at least use fine-tuning.  Most of us just don&rsquo;t have the tools or knowledge to know what to look for.</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve been listening to sales rep pitch their products and services for over 25 years now, and <strong>  there are still words, phrases and techniques that send shivers down my spine. </strong> And I&rsquo;ll tell you now they send shivers down the spines of their prospects and clients, too. </p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; when selling over the phone, <strong>  all you have is your voice </strong> , and the way you deliver your presentation &ndash; <strong>  the words you use, the inflection, pacing and timing you use </strong> &ndash; has a huge impact on the way you are perceived by your prospects. Unfortunately, many sales reps project an image of being unprepared, unsure, rushed and sometimes even scared. </p><p> Your prospects sense this immediately. They know from your first few sentences whether they are dealing with a confident sales pro, or with someone who isn&rsquo;t very sure of what they&rsquo;re selling and who is uncomfortable with the sales process. And like sharks, these prospects will attack and blow you off with all the stalls, resistance and objections you get now. </p><p> If you want to project an image of professional competency, then make sure and avoid using any of the following statements or words:</p><p> What NOT to say when cold calling or prospecting:</p><p> 1) Stop opening your calls with, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve written about this before, but 99% of sales reps are still telegraphing themselves as unwanted sales persons by starting out their conversations this way. How do YOU feel when someone you don&rsquo;t know calls you and uses this worn out line? Probably like hanging up on them&ndash; which is exactly how your prospects feel as well. So stop it!</p><p> Instead, use a better opening line that immediately differentiates you from all the other sales reps calling your prospects. Use something that connects with them instead, that focuses them on the call and that forces them to think and interact with you. </p><p> A few of my favorites are: &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your Tuesday going so far?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Has it started/stopped snowing there yet?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Can you hear me O.K.?&rdquo;</p><p> 2) Take the word, &ldquo;individual&rdquo; out of your vocabulary when speaking, emailing or otherwise addressing a prospect, as in, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re a busy individual&hellip;&rdquo; The word individual is an institutional, cold phrase that doesn&rsquo;t belong in a sales conversation. </p><p> Think about it: When was the last time someone you didn&rsquo;t know called you and referred to you or your wife as &ldquo;individuals&rdquo;? How&rsquo;d that make you feel? Did it give you the warm and fuzziness or did you make you think you were about to be committed?</p><p> The language you use must help you create a natural, conversational tone, and words like, &ldquo;busy individual&rdquo; or &ldquo;busy professional&rdquo;, etc, do just the opposite. </p><p> 3) &ldquo;Things of that nature.&rdquo; I cringe as I even write those words&hellip;. Whenever I hear a sales rep end a sentence with &ldquo;Things of that nature,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m pretty sure they have no idea of what they&rsquo;re talking about. That phrase is most often used by mediocre sales reps to hide or cover up the truth that they don&rsquo;t know all the details of what they&rsquo;re talking about. Or, it is used to as lazy way to bridge into other qualifying questions. </p><p> If you are using it now, please consider using something else, or better, explain a few of those &ldquo;things&rdquo; and then use a tie down to see how that landed&hellip;</p><p> What NOT to say when closing a sale:</p><p> 1) &ldquo;Can you transfer me to (the decision maker)?&rdquo; Most presentations end with the stall: &ldquo;Well, I need to run this by my boss/partner/manager/corporate, etc.&rdquo; Unfortunately, this usually comes as a surprise to many sales reps who failed to qualify for this upfront. Some sales reps then think they can just bulldoze through the stall by demanding to talk to the decision maker right then and there. </p><p> While I applaud you for your tenacity, asking to blatantly go above the person&rsquo;s head you&rsquo;re speaking to or have just pitched, immediately alienates them. Often times this person is some kind of sales influencer and alienating them is NOT what you want to do. </p><p> Instead you should use different techniques, one of which being: &ldquo;So, John, when you consult with your manager, is this something that you&rsquo;re sold on and will recommend to them?&rdquo; (If yes, then): &ldquo;Great, how can I help you sell them on this?&rdquo; (Only if they can&rsquo;t think of anything): &ldquo;Would it help if I spoke to them and went over this just like I did with you?&rdquo; </p><p> That&rsquo;s the way to get permission and to finally earn the right to speak to the decision maker.</p><p> 2) &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that &ndash; let me get back to you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s O.K. that you don&rsquo;t have an answer for something, but what&rsquo;s important is that you convey that in a confident manner. Try any of the following:</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great question and we have several ways of handling that. Let me ask you a couple of questions regarding your particular situation, and then I&rsquo;ll be able to get the best solution for you&hellip;&rdquo; OR</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question for my technical support team. Let me see what they would propose and get back with you.&rdquo; OR</p><p> &ldquo;We have a whole department that deals with that, and I&rsquo;ll check with them to give you the best solution.&rdquo; <br/> Each of these responses helps you delay answering until you get the right answer, but they paint the picture of a bigger, more competent company structure which helps to give you credibility. </p><p> 3) &ldquo;When should I call you back?&rdquo; Why would you want to put the crucial follow up of your sale in the hands of your customer? Asking this question means handing over control of the sale to the prospect which means you lose control. That&rsquo;s bad. Here are better ways of keeping control and getting a commitment for a follow up call:</p><p> &ldquo;How long will that take?&rdquo; Then: &ldquo;O.K. I&rsquo;ve got my calendar open and that would put us to Tuesday of next week. Are you looking at your calendar? Great. How does 2:45pm look for you?&rdquo; OR</p><p> &ldquo;(Prospect Name) you&rsquo;re probably as busy as I am, so let&rsquo;s go ahead and schedule a follow up call to access progress. I can do this same time (tomorrow, Friday, next week), does that work for you?&rdquo; OR</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take me (a day, two days, a week, etc.) to get this started on my end, how about I give you a call around Friday at this time to see if there&rsquo;s anything else you need? Does 2:15pm work for you again?&rdquo;</p><p> The key here is to get a commitment. All top producers remain in control of the selling process and know when the next call in the sales cycle is &ndash; and so do their prospects!</p><p> So there you have six things to stay away from during your next sales call. As you use these techniques, you&rsquo;ll find yourself developing better rapport, getting more information and staying in control of your selling situations. Heck, it&rsquo;s starting to sound like you&rsquo;re a top producer already!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Over the last 15 years I&rsquo;ve interviewed over 1000 senior corporate executives about their most trusted advisors and strategic suppliers. I&rsquo;ve asked them about who has earned a seat at the table with them, and how it was done. I&rsquo;ve explored&mdash;from their side of the desk&mdash;the ingredients of great, long-term trusted partnerships with external providers of all stripes.</p><p> Here are eight things client executives tell me they value and want, over and over again:</p><h3> 1. &ldquo;Be a trusted advisor to me even when you aren&rsquo;t earning a lot of fees.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Put another way, executives are saying, &ldquo;My trusted advisors are there for me in flush times and lean times&mdash;through thick and thin.&rdquo;</p><p> On the surface, this may sound like clients want to get something for nothing. But that isn&rsquo;t what they mean. I recently interviewed the former CEO of a major manufacturing company, who articulated this need very clearly. He described a particular investment bank that had earned trusted advisor status with him:</p><p> &ldquo;My company was substantial in size but not the largest in the industry, and we didn&rsquo;t use investment banking services that often. Most of the major banks would only spend time with me when they sensed an imminent, fee-earning transaction. But this particular firm was generous in terms of coming to see me regularly and sharing very insightful views about the markets. Even when we weren&rsquo;t very active, they came to visit. They stayed in touch and built an ongoing relationship. They ended up getting most of our business when we did do some major deals.&rdquo;</p><p> Think of it this way: How do you feel about a friend who only calls you up when they want something from you?</p><h3> 2. &ldquo;Help me think about my problems differently.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This is slightly different than solving a specific problem, which is number 3, below. Sometimes, it means &ldquo;Help me define and frame the problem properly.&rdquo; It can also mean &ldquo;Stimulate and push my thinking about these issues so when we do address them, we take the right approach.&rdquo;</p><p> For example, occasionally a client will contact me and present what they see as a skills development or &ldquo;training&rdquo; issue. If warranted&mdash;and after I carefully explore their problem with thoughtful questions&ndash;I try and help the executive understand that achieving the higher-order goal they have in mind will require a multifaceted approach that involves other interventions besides just training. They may need to adopt a different go-to-market strategy, break down the silos in their organization, or perhaps implement a key client planning and management process. In short, I help them reframe the situation and think about it differently.</p><h3> 3. &ldquo;Help me better understand how to address a specific challenge I&rsquo;m facing.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Some clients also express this as &ldquo;bring me new ideas.&rdquo; Yes, clients do want new ideas. But they need to be relevant ideas that illuminate a particular issue they are concerned about and therefore help them accomplish their goals.</p><p> One senior client executive told me this:</p><p> &ldquo;One year we became very focused on improving our ROA, or return on assets. We were lagging our peers on this measure and the analysts were highlighting it as a weakness. A consulting firm we had worked on and off with came to me and suggested they put together a workshop on best practices for enhancing ROA. They brought some of their experts, and we put a team together as well. They didn&rsquo;t charge us for the session, but it led to a major project for them. That was the catalyst for them to become one of our &ldquo;inner circle&rdquo; firms.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. &ldquo;Price is a secondary consideration in choosing someone to work with. Show me other important qualities that I need in a partner.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Clients go on to add: &ldquo;Value, perceived risk, the strength of the proposed approach/methodology, industry and company understanding, and organizational fit are more important unless your price is really out of the ballpark.&rdquo;</p><p> You may be shaking your head as you read this statement. Not only have I heard this hundreds of times, but it is borne out by other quantitative research into buying habits: Price is usually third or even fourth in importance when it comes to selecting a company for a particular need. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><li> It&rsquo;s risky to hire an external provider for an important project. Clients tell me that they carefully balance the risk of failure against differences in price, and they are willing to pay a bit more if they believe one provider will be a less risky choice.</li><li> Clients&mdash;even procurement managers&mdash;do want value. The question is: Have you made a compelling case for your additional value and your higher fee?</li><li> A purchase decision is usually based on multiple criteria that the purchaser tries to balance. Price is only one of many factors. <br/>  </li><h3>  5. &ldquo;Ask me thoughtful, informed questions based on your deep experience and careful preparation.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> They go on to add: &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re meeting with me for the very first time, don&rsquo;t just walk in and pepper me with questions. Tell me why you&rsquo;re here, what you&rsquo;d like to accomplish, and add some value first. Then you can start asking me questions.&rdquo;</p><p> What most people think passes for a good question is usually a pretty average one. In a live workshop, I&rsquo;ll often do an exercise where small groups come up with the questions they&rsquo;d really like to ask either a prospect or an existing client. We then take some of these, and as a group discuss them and slowly improve and sharpen them until they are really good. Often they start with a potential question like this: &ldquo;Are you concerned about the new regulation Q that just came out?&rdquo; I role play the answer, and simply say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; End of conversation.</p><p> A better question is, of course, &ldquo;What do you think the impact of Regulation Q is going to be?&rdquo;</p><p> Even better would be, &ldquo;What changes in policies or procedures are you thinking about making to accommodate Regulation Q?&rdquo;</p><h3>  6. &ldquo;Help us understand and manage the change that&rsquo;s required.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The products and services that a company buys are all used within a broader organizational system. For a new software application to work well, for example, it must mesh and align with existing business processes, human skills and behavior patterns, other IT systems, and so on. Many client executives have told me that advice, insight, and tools to help manage the change around your solutions are extremely valuable.</p><p> There&rsquo;s opportunity, in short, to examine the larger organizational &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; around your solutions and advise your clients on how to make everything work together faster, better, and easier. To help them, in effect, manage change.</p><p> This was exactly the key insight that Lou Gerstner gleaned at the start of his tenure as IBM&rsquo;s new CEO in 1993. At the time, people were clamoring for IBM to be split up into as many as a dozen different businesses. Gerstner had spent four months visiting IBM customers all over the world, and one of their most forceful messages was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break yourself up&mdash;instead, help us do a better job of actually using the hardware and software that we buy from you.&rdquo; This led to a major emphasis on growing the nascent IBM Global Services business, which now generates $60 billion in high-margin revenue from IT services, outsourcing, and consulting.</p><h3> 7. &ldquo;Make it easy for us to work with you.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This one should be easy to give to clients, but apparently it&rsquo;s not. The less friction there is in your working relationship, the easier you will make life for your client, and the happier they will be with your association.</p><p> Here are some ways to make it easy and pleasurable to work with you:</p><li> Write up and share notes of all your meetings within 24 hours</li><li> Respond rapidly and cheerfully to client requests</li><li> Don&rsquo;t complain (one client told me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come to me complaining about a problem in working with my organization&mdash;come to me with a recommended solution&rdquo;)</li><li> Communicate frequently</li><li> Anticipate&mdash;point out what may happen and what your plan will be to deal with it, and flag problems immediately to avoid surprises</li><li> Listen carefully and ask questions before you respond to a client concern or start pointing out how your client has contributed to the problem</li><li> Offer to do your client&rsquo;s work and unburden them (e.g., your client has to send out a communication about your project to their organization&mdash;write the first draft for them; your client has to prepare a plan for their boss&mdash;help them outline it; etc.) <br/>  </li><h3> 8. &ldquo;Show us that you care and that you&rsquo;re engaged.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes those old clich&eacute;s still have significance! You may have heard the expression &ldquo;A person doesn&rsquo;t care how much you know until they know how much you care.&rdquo; I hear stories from clients all the time about service providers who are disengaged, unprepared, and distracted. They ask basic questions they should already know the answers to. They turn proposals in at the very last minute or even late. They don&rsquo;t appear committed.</p><p> You show engagement by:</p><li> Being genuinely interested in and curious about their business and their organization (often shown through the thoughtful questions you ask)</li><li> Demonstrating enthusiasm in your interactions</li><li> Preparing and doing your homework</li><li> Being fully present during your meetings and phone calls. Is your attention 100% in the conversation, or are you thinking ahead to the next meeting or your next deliverable?</li><h3> In Summary</h3><p> <br/> There are, of course, other useful things client executives tell me when I interview them, but these eight represent some of the most important ideas. To recap:</p><li> &ldquo;Be a trusted advisor to me even when you aren&rsquo;t earning lot of fees.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Help me think about my problems differently.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Help me better understand how to address a specific challenge I&rsquo;m facing.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Price is a secondary consideration in choosing someone to work with.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Ask me thoughtful, informed questions based on your deep experience and careful preparation.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Help us understand and manage the change that&rsquo;s required.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Make it easy for us to work with you.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Show us that you care and that you&rsquo;re engaged.&rdquo;</li>",

    "content": "<p> I dedicate this blog post to women who worry their student loan debt will prohibit them from reaching their professional dreams. According to a recent survey by Uchic, a lifestyle brand for young women, 67% of the female survey respondents they surveyed believe the high cost of education is holding them back. This number is significant in light of a  <u>  <a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Recovery2020.ES_.Web_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent study conducted by Georgetown University  </a> </u>  that estimates by 2020, 65 percent of all jobs in the economy will require post secondary education and training beyond high school. Given this Catch-22 young woman are asking themselves the fifty thousand dollar question &mdash; is it worth it?​</p><p> For me, going to grad school was a no-brainer but that&rsquo;s not to say I didn&rsquo;t struggle with my decision. Earning a graduate degree from NYU was pricey. Going in, I knew two things: 1. I did not want to incur a single cent of debt, and 2. The 40 credits + commutation expenses would put my total cost for tuition well above the $50k benchmark. Another challenge I would consider: The longer I put off enrollment, the more expensive the price. Would the value of a Master&rsquo;s Program be worth it? There was never a doubt in my mind that it was, but formulating a strategy to pay for it and staying the course required toughness, tenacity, and tactics.</p><p> I warn you, there are no CliffNotes, no shortcuts, no cramming your way through the sacrifices to execute these strategies. Keep in mind what worked for me, may or may not, work for you. The way I found success was to combine these tactics, as many as eight, at any given time.</p><li> <strong>  Maintain a high GPA. </strong> You must study do well to earn the highest GPA possible. The reason being is pretty simple. In order to qualify for fellowships and grants, outstanding class rank and test scores are requisites. For example,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.evaleeschwarztrust.org/Application.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Evalee C. Schwarz Charitable Trust for Education  </a> </u>  requires test scores be in the top 15% of nation-wide scores in order to receive a potential $5,000 - $15,000 award amount. </li><li> <strong>  Apply for fellowships. </strong> <a href=\"http://grants.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   G  </u> </a> <u>  <a href=\"http://grants.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rants. com  </a> </u>  and  <u>  Scholly the app </u>  can provide a full list of available awards and grants. I guarantee there are hundreds you have never heard of. The tough part is in the application process which is very detailed and lengthy. You will need several hours if not days to gather all of the requirements. Apply early to set yourself up for success.</li><li> <strong>  Spread out your education. </strong> One course, the equivalent of three credits per semester, including summer and winter, helps with keeping pace of payments. Another huge benefit you may not have anticipated &mdash; eligibility for additional fellowship and grant monies over a longer period of time.</li><li> <strong>  Keep your day job. </strong>  A steady stream helps a lot. Working your day job provides you with a predictable stream of income to set off expense not to mention it keeps you connected to your employer. This is absolutely vital if your boss is footing some of the bill via a tuition reimbursement plan at work. Never sever the additional benefits of employment such as employer match for 401(k), partial or full medical plan, fringe and paid benefits just for a degree. You may never get these benefits back from your next job.</li><li> <strong>  Negotiate tuition reimbursement with your employer. </strong> Applying new found skills at work can set the stage to negotiation a partial or full tuition reimbursement plan. Some employers want a high GPA in order to receive a benefit while others will place other strings attached, such as requiring employees to stay with the company a certain amount of time post-graduation.</li><li> <strong>  Use holiday bonus. </strong> You know that holiday bonus? Take it directly to the bursar&rsquo;s office and use it for education expenses. Credit your account if necessary for the next semester and apply the full amount to your next bill.</li><li> <strong>  Add a side hustle, ideally work for your University. </strong> Many colleges and universities offer teacher assistant programs to graduate students in exchange for free classes. This is a win-win as you gain valuable work experience, grow your professional network, and offset educational expenses all together. Furthermore, your University may even offer a full-time role post-graduation.  <u>  Related College Scorecard Makes the Grade </u>  </li><li> <strong>  Study in Europe for free, yes for free. </strong> Visit  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.studyportals.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   StudyPortals.com  </a> </u>  and search for a list of available Master&rsquo;s Programs for free that teach also teach in English. University of Oslo in Norway for example offers degrees in Engineering, Business, and Health Economics, Policy and Management taught in English at no cost for American students.</li><li> <strong>  Frugal living and bad ass budgeting. </strong> A combination of frugal living on a very tight budget will help free up some much needed cash for book rentals, commutation expenses, and other variable educational expenses. Give up your daily latte at Starbucks and brown bag your dinner to add some bulk to your wallet.</li><li> <strong>  The American Opportunity Credit and The Lifetime Learning Credit. </strong> Take advantage of two education tax credits that can make higher education costs more affordable. <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit\" target=\"_blank\">   T  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit\" target=\"_blank\">   he American opportunity tax credit  </a> </u> , originally called the Hope scholarship credit, is a tax credit of up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year. Also, 40% of the credit (up to $1,000) is refundable. This means you can get it even if you owe no tax. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Lifetime Learning Credit for 2014  </a> </u>  is a tax credit of up to $2,000 credit per return, with income restrictions: $128,000 of married filed jointly and $64,000 if single, head of household, or qualifying widow(er). Be sure to check IRS.gov and the tax code, there are restrictions for each. <br/>  </li><p> Let&rsquo;s not sugarcoat it, <strong>  getting out of grad school without debt is doable but certainly not easy. </strong> Ultimately, you have to ask yourself if you&rsquo;re ready to bring you&rsquo;re A game and will it be worth it? If you ask me, I say yes.</p>",

    "link": "what-it-takes-to-be-the-quarterback-of-your-clients-team",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> \"We act as kind of a quarterback on your team of advisors...\"</p><p> \"We coordinate your financial plan in conjunction with your accountant and attorney...\"</p><p> \"We are like the conductor of an orchestra...\"</p><p> I have heard many advisors describe themselves this way. And I have heard through several  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theclientdrivenpractice.com/advisory-board-process/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   client advisory boards  </a> </u>  that people appreciate an advisor who can play a coordinating role. In a few cases, clients report that it is one of the things they value about their advisor the most.</p><p> But to be able to deliver on a promise like this &ndash; for it to be an effective part of your  <strong>  value proposition </strong>  and help you build loyalty and attract  <strong>  referrals </strong>  &ndash; a few things must be true. And to be effective in attracting clients, you will need to be able to articulate those specifics in addition to simply making the claim.</p><p> The financial planner naturally would play a role like this. Attorneys, accountants, bankers and property casualty insurance agents, for example, generally do not prepare comprehensive plans to help guide a client toward their objectives. Other practitioners do not deliberately work to integrate all the other specialties into a unified strategy.</p><p> When it comes to implementation, though, many advisors fall short. Some work hard to coordinate the efforts of the clients&rsquo; other advisors, but do not have a uniform process for doing it and so have difficulty articulating exactly how they do it. Others reach out to those other professionals only as a specific need arises or when special situations arise and so do not deliver it consistently. And many pay lip service to the role without actually delivering on it very often. In all of these cases, the potential of the promise loses its potency.</p><p> Here are some things you must be able to offer to credibly be the client&rsquo;s quarterback:</p><p> <strong>  Offer financial planning </strong> &ndash; First, you have to actually plan. If you specialize in investment management, if you do not consistently deliver a written plan to new clients as part of the onboarding process, then there is no good reason why you should be the quarterback. And there is no reason the clients&rsquo; other advisors should take you seriously in that role. You are a specialist just like they are. And the coordinator of the advisory team could just as well be the estate attorney or the accountant. Writing a comprehensive plan that shows how all the pieces should interact is the first step in making you the logical choice to coordinate everyone else.</p><p> <strong>  Have a formal point in your process when you will coordinate with other advisors </strong> &ndash; Consistently reaching out to confer with other advisors at specific points in the planning process or at certain times of year, like touching base with the accountant each spring, helps you make sure you actually are coordinating with those other advisors. It also provides some proof to the client. When you assert to a potential client that part of your value, part of the reason they need you, is that coordinating role, a natural reaction may be to ask how you do it. The ability to pull out your process graphic and point to where you consult with the other advisors is compelling evidence that you do.</p><p> <strong>  Be consistent </strong> &ndash; Following through on coordinating with other professionals from client to client helps make sure you always deliver on the role and increases the likelihood that your clients will consistently talk about that aspect of your service. It also helps you spread that reputation among those other advisors.</p><p> <strong>  Have a solid, current network of people you can refer the client to </strong> &ndash; the advisors who most effectively act as a client&rsquo;s quarterback also have a reputation for being able to recommend other professionals as well as coordinating with them. What I hear from their clients are comments like &ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t solve the problem, he can send us to someone who can.&rdquo;  This closely parallels another characteristic of great rainmakers: They are always on the lookout for what else their clients need and making it their business to help them find someone who can take care of it. It can also be helpful to have a formal vetting process. Showing your client some due diligence is much more professional than simply sending them to your buddies.</p><p> Beyond what you need to have to be a quarterback, you can strengthen your position as the coordinator if you include some of these in your service offering:</p><p> <strong>  A client vault that can be shared with those advisors </strong> &ndash; If you want to assume the role that coordinates the efforts of all the clients&rsquo; advisors, it is great to have tools to make it easier to work with you. Sending a client&rsquo;s K-1 forms to their accountant is helpful. Having a secure place in the cloud where you can make it available to both the accountant and the client, instantly, is even better.</p><p> <strong>  An organizer to help clients &ldquo;get their house in order&rdquo; </strong> &ndash; This can be basic and old-school and still be very effective. If not a vault, give the client an expanding file, or some other physical receptacle, in which to store all the documents from the various aspects of their legal and financial lives. If you want to coordinate the clients&rsquo; other advisors, help them organize the output of those advisors as well.</p><p> <strong>  Have formal meetings with those other advisors when a new client joins </strong>  to clarify your role and to discover how you can help them produce great outcomes for your mutual client &ndash; Find out what you can do to help the other advisors carry out their responsibilities. Would they appreciate you sending tax forms from investment accountant rather than waiting for the client to bring them in? How far should you go with a client in describing or recommending a strategy before the attorney believes you are treading on their function? Addressing how you can best facilitate their roles can make them more inclined to work with you.</p><p> What strategies have you found that help you deliver on the promise to be the client&rsquo;s quarterback? I would love to hear some of the things your clients have commented are most valuable to them.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Your to-do list is columns and pages long. Your Outlook is full of color-coded tasks and reminders. Your calendar is full of meetings.You battle interruptions from superiors, subordinates and colleagues with additional questions and requests. Your lists just get longer.</p><p> You are busy.</p><p> Your deadlines get missed. Your goals get delayed. You have guilt about not achieving the things you set out and agreed to do. You feel anxiety about getting it all done because there are not enough hours in the day for you to complete the work and maintain any semblance of balance between your work and your life.</p><p> You are NOT productive.</p><p> Busyness has become like a competition. We tell everyone who will listen about how busy we are. We rattle off the things on our to-do lists and the meetings we must attend.  Busyness makes us feel important and, when others acknowledge and affirm our busyness, we feel valued. Since we all want to feel important and valued in the work we do, we convince ourselves that busyness is good.</p><p> This is a lie.</p><p> First of all, busyness is relative. What is busy to one person may be a typical Tuesday to someone else. With the definition of busyness being so subjective, it cannot be judged or become the standard for achievement. Busyness is not the thing that we encourage people to strive for.</p><p> Productivity is the thing. Productivity is good.</p><p> What separates busyness from productivity is results. People who are busy don&rsquo;t tend to get nearly as much done as those who are productive. Busyness treads water while productivity swims laps. Busyness runs in place while productivity travels forward. Busyness speaks while productivity acts. Busyness twiddles its thumbs while productivity gets $#!+ done.</p><p> It is easy to get the two twisted. It is easy to confuse busyness with productivity. It is easy to get trapped in a cycle of busyness and lose your productivity altogether. When this happens, here&rsquo;s what you do:</p><li> <strong>  Get focused </strong> &hellip; Productivity requires you to prioritize your priorities. Your to-do list may have 100 things on it &mdash; but they are not all the most important thing, they are not all due at the same time and they cannot all have your undivided attention in the same moment. Figure out what must be first and focus on it until it is either done or advanced sufficiently that you can work on something else.</li><li> <strong>  Get clear </strong> &hellip;  Productivity requires you to have clarity on the expected outcomes so you can best organize your time and efforts. But prioritizing the priorities is not easy. It requires checking in with your respective &ldquo;boss&rdquo; (supervisor, client, etc.) to determine what they deem most important so you can be sure of where to place the energy of your efforts.  Once you are clear on expectations, you can decide your direction. You may need help from others. You may need to delegate some stuff. You may need to negotiate for a deadline extension. You may need to pass on an opportunity altogether. Whatever you need, it is best to figure all that out before getting too far into working on the project so you don&rsquo;t waste resources or time.</li><li> <strong>  Get alone </strong> &hellip; Productivity requires you to have space where you can be by yourself and work. Once you know the priorities and expectations, you have to get away from everyone else so you can get it all done. You have to shut off your phone and stop checking email. You must close your door. You must eliminate as many distractions as you can so you can attack your to-do items. <br/>  </li><p> We are all busy. Everyone has people and duties clamoring for our attention. Everyone has more work to get done than hours in the day to do it all &hellip;  The difference between busy people and productive people is focus, clarity and separateness.</p><p> If we want to achieve unprecedented results and develop a reputation as a person who is reliable, diligent and effective, we have to move beyond busyness to productivity. We have to get $#!+ done.</p>",

    "link": "3-ways-to-build-credibility-with-straight-talk",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BooherConsults\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Booher Consultants  </u> </a>  </p><p> Do you find yourself bending the truth a little, perhaps to make a difficult message hurt less? Although your intentions may be good, sugarcoating situations can cross over the line into dishonesty. Integrity is at the heart of building credibility, which can be accomplished through straight talk. Here&rsquo;s how.</p><h3> Acknowledge the truth</h3><p> <br/> If you find your team&rsquo;s sales are down, don&rsquo;t be afraid to own up to the numbers. If performance needs improvement, say so. Be honest about negative feedback or the need for improvement, but say it gently. Try not to single out an individual publicly, which will embarrass that individual and encourage a scapegoat mentality within the team. If there is a specific individual&rsquo;s performance that needs to be addressed, talk to him/her privately.</p><p> Corporately, when addressing issues within the team, explain the situation tactfully but honestly. Nothing decreases your credibility like blaming or redirecting responsibility to others. Accept any of the responsibility that is yours and continue to maintain your integrity. A small person will run from responsibility, but someone who shoulders the responsibility and the consequences builds credibility and respect.</p><h3> Stop candy-coating the unknown</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do fine,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll work itself out, wait and see.&rdquo; These words are almost programmed into our vocabulary. However, these phrases can sound empty &ndash; if not insulting &ndash; when used by leadership. In building credibility with your employees, do not make open-ended commitments to the future &ndash; you do not possibly know how things will turn out.</p><p> That does not imply being insincere. Be encouraging, giving a clear directive on how to improve the situation/issue, without giving unfounded assurances. This will ensure that you are not building expectations that may go unmet. One of the best ways to build credibility is to manage expectations &ndash; address the current situation straightforwardly, and go from there.</p><h3> Focus on options</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;The power of positive thinking.&rdquo; We hear this all the time, and it does not need to be limited to our personal lives. By focusing on the positive aspects or the many options in a situation, you can change the tenor of the situation. By combining the forces of your group, new ideas will spring up, and when everyone is honest about the situation, progress is made. Acknowledge the problem, then focus on a clear plan for overcoming it. You continue to build credibility as you bring everyone together to look for options. Become a thought leader, empowering your team by using helpful straight talk to address the substantive issues.</p><p> Once you have these baselines covered, you will see the progress moving forward. Your credibility with straight talk will show others that you are here to lead and help. As the team overcomes obstacles together under your leadership, the culture of the group will improve significantly. Any new problems will be met with optimism and creativity, as you communicate and lead with integrity and empowerment.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Kate Bailey </u></p><p> The importance of ethics in financial services, the future of robots and artificial intelligence and the undeniable benefits of having women on boards: these issues and more were explored at this week&rsquo;s Australia Investment Conference held by CFA Societies Australia (#CFAAIC2015, for those following on Twitter).</p><p> Over 400 delegates attended to the conference, themed on &lsquo;Going Back to Fundamentals&rsquo;, to hear speakers such as Greg Medcraft, Chairman of the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC); Philip Lowe, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA); and David Murray, AO, former CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Chair of the Financial System Inquiry and now Senior Adviser at Credit Suisse.</p><p> For those of you who missed it (BlueChip didn&rsquo;t) here are some of the juicier highlights.</p><p> <strong>  Professionalism (Regaining lost trust &ndash; a roadmap for change in financial services)  </strong></p><p> <strong>  Presented by Paul Smith, President &amp; CEO of CFA Institute </strong></p><p> Australia&rsquo;s reputation as a beacon of world-class prudential and corporate regulation was cemented in 2007 when our financial system fared better than many other developed nations in the fall out from the global financial crisis.</p><p> Yet, said Mr Smith, the industry&rsquo;s internal culture is now threatening this hard-won respect. The &lsquo;enemy within&rsquo; must be addressed by the whole investment industry by:</p><li> Setting high standards of entry, and demonstrate professionalism</li><li> Creating business models geared towards achieving investor outcomes</li><li> Advocating for regulations which align firms and clients <br/>  </li><p> CFA Societies in Australia and New Zealand have developed an &lsquo;ethical map&rsquo; aimed at building an investment culture based on ethics, market integrity and technical excellence, which they are seeking to share globally, with the help of CFA Institute.</p><p> Now is the crucial time for Australian financial services. Culture is the issue.</p><p> <strong>  New technologies: creative destruction on steroids  </strong></p><p> <strong>  Presented by Ken Lee, Head of Asia and Managing Director 13D Research </strong>  </p><p> Productivity, employment, the labour market and real GDP have traditionally moved together but over the last decade they have started diverging &ndash; and there are more reasons for this than the usually cited outsourcing and growth of China, according to Mr Lee.</p><p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics in particular are having and will continue to have a significant impact on the way humans live, he said, highlighting several examples.</p><li> An article can be written by a robot. IBM&rsquo;s thinking machine, called Watson, can beat you in Chess or read 60 million pages of text per second.</li><li> It would take Watson just one minute to read all the 16 million books in the Library of Congress in Washington.</li><li> Pepper the Robot was interviewed by a human journalist. The robot joked to the journalist about borrowing 10,000 yen from him.</li><li> &ldquo;A robot at home will be as common as televisions are now in five years&rsquo; time &hellip; the first need for them will be aged care,&rdquo; Mr Lee predicted.</li><li> &ldquo;If you look at all the data created from the dawn of time until 2003, Google creates as much data now every 2 days.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Mr Lee emphasised that humans have to connect the dots between the different types of knowledge that machines produce. The machines do not have emotion, or the ability to think laterally yet, and they don&rsquo;t understand entrepreneurship.</p><p> &ldquo;Two billion jobs could be replaced by AI and robotics &ndash; it could be more dangerous than nuclear weapons. There are likely only two types of jobs in the future: you are the manager of robots or you are managed by a robot,&rdquo; Mr Lee warned.</p><p> <strong>  The high cost of gender imbalance and what to do about it </strong></p><p> <strong>  Presented by Heather Brilliant, CEO Morningstar Australasia </strong></p><p> Heather Brilliant&rsquo;s address focused on the financial and other data-proven benefits of having a balance of genders in the investment workplace.</p><p> Data shows that diversity can lead to better investment outcomes, she emphasised. It shows that neither women or men are better portfolio managers, but that mixed teams outperformed men or women alone, creating an obvious case for a balance of genders in the workplace.</p><p> Ms Brilliant highlighted that:</p><li> Companies with more than one woman on the board performed at a compound 3.7% a year higher rate than those with none</li><li> Companies with the most women board directors outperformed those with the least by 26%, on an ROIC basis</li><li> Companies with the highest share of women outperformed companies with no women <br/>  </li><p> Ms Brilliant added that CFA Institute has launched the Women in Investment Management Initiative to:</p><li> Encourage women into the investment management profession</li><li> Support those that have joined</li><li> Carry out research to make sure the business case for diversity was crystal clear <br/>  </li><p> She emphasised that the industry and employers must ensure that women were part of the candidate pool and that they must &ldquo;recruit beyond traditional backgrounds.&rdquo;</p><p> The other important factor, Ms Brilliant added, was that women advocate for themselves differently from men. They were less likely to ask for a raise or promotion. As leaders we should take this into consideration when seeking to create a collaborative environment where women can advance in their careers at the same pace as men do, she said.</p>",

    "link": "how-to-create-customer-trust",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s an old adage that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before in my writings and video lessons: People, as in customers, like to do business with people they know, like, and trust. The knowing and liking is easy. Just creating a good image and having a good reputation makes it easy for customers to want to like you. Be nice and respectful and they start to feel like they are getting to know you. But, the trusting is more difficult. You have to earn your customers&rsquo; trust by following through and creating a predictable experience.</p><p> Creating trust is paramount to creating customer loyalty. And anytime you have an opportunity to prove yourself and establish a little more trust with the customer, take advantage of it.</p><p> So, how do you know when your customers trust you? Aside from repeat business, referrals and accolades, there is one word that you are looking for them to use as they describe you. That word is always.</p><p> They are  always  so nice. They  always  take care of me. I can  always  count on them. And, when there is a mistake or a problem, they  always  fix it.</p><p> So, how do you get to that level of trust? How do you get the word always to be part of your customers&rsquo; description of you?</p><li> <strong>  Be respectful. </strong> Customers want and deserve it. They actually expect it. Say please and thank you. Show up on time.</li><li> Be predictable. <strong>  Customers want an experience they can count on. </strong> They want to know that if you say the shipment will be there by Thursday, it will. They want to know that the service they get will always be what they expect. Being predictable is so much about the word always.</li><li> <strong>  Create consistency. </strong> Some would argue that this is the same as being predictable, but hear me out. I may deal with Bob on one day and Sally the next. I don&rsquo;t expect these two people to be clones of one another. But, I do expect a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-loyalty/customer-service-tool-consistency/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   consistency  </a> </u>  in their helpfulness and enthusiasm for taking care of me. This is more about the culture and personality of the organization than the actual experience. And, the personality is an important part of the experience.</li><li> <strong>  Eliminate friction. </strong> It could be slow moving line, a long hold time, complicated forms, having to repeat your account number to the customer service rep after you were asked to key it in on your phone pad. I could go on and on with the friction points that customers of many types of business deal with. Find out what your friction points are and do your best to eliminate them.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t fail. </strong> Okay, this is not reality. This is actually a goal. Nobody and no organization is perfect. But, trying to be is important. And, having the system to fix the problem properly is important. <br/>  </li><p> Sure, there are more ideas, tips and tactics we can add to this list. (And, feel free to share them with us below.) So, to summarize, creating the  always   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-experience-2/consistent-predictable-experience-creates-customer-confidence/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   predictable  </a> </u>  customer experience falls into two areas; operations and culture. Is your system in place, and does it work?  Is your culture defined, and do your people walk the talk?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pfripp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Patricia Fripp  </a> </u></p><p> A few years ago, I had a conversation with my friend Jeff Davidson, a prolific author and popular professional speaker, about why it is that speakers sometimes fail to hit the mark. The result of our brainstorm was the article below, which explains the three  <strong>  most common reasons speakers do not connect with their audiences or live up to a meeting planner&rsquo;s expectations. </strong> They are still true today. Whether we are experienced professional speakers, or aspiring speakers, it is  <strong>  a good reminder of the continual commitment and work required to consistently deliver excellent presentations: </strong></p><h3> Three Reasons Speakers Fail to Hit the Mark</h3><p> <br/> Be aware of these three common mistakes speakers make &ndash; professional speakers included. All three have to do with a lack of adequate preparation.</p><h3> 1) Not Understanding the Assignment</h3><p> <br/> Before ever leaving your own office, it is critical to understand why you have been scheduled to speak to this group at this time. Such understanding necessitates that you  <strong>  read about the organization, get information about the organization&rsquo;s current challenges and hot buttons, and learn what the meeting planner has in mind for the presentation. </strong>  Five-minute conversations over the phone with a meeting planner are unlikely to give you all you need to know in that area.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a celebrity speaker &ndash; brought in so that people in the audience can go home and say, &ldquo;Guess what? I saw so and so!&rdquo; &ndash; it may seem like it barely matters what you speak about, as long as you are semi-coherent and don&rsquo;t offend the group. However, the best celebrity speakers will make an effort in advance to understand something about the organization they are speaking to help ensure a successful presentation.</p><p> <strong>  As for us non-celebrities, the people in their seats want to hear ideas and concepts that directly relate to their own professional and industry challenges </strong>  &ndash; or, ideas and concepts that relate to issues of universal importance that affect their communities, state, nation, or the planet.</p><p> <strong>  The only way to come armed with the proper information is to spend some time </strong>  &ndash; at the very least, a full hour &ndash; <strong>  researching the group you are speaking to and its unique challenges. </strong></p><h3> 2) Failing to Know Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> Beyond understanding the organization and why you are invited to speak, knowing your audience is in itself an art and a science.</p><p> <strong>  Ask: </strong></p><li> Who are they?</li><li> What is their age range?</li><li> What is their educational background?</li><li> How long have they been with the organization?</li><li> What is this particular meeting designed to do for an individual audience member? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Then probe even deeper: </strong></p><li> How far have they come?</li><li> Do they know each other or are they assembling for the first time?</li><li> What will they hear before and after the presentation?</li><li> What did they hear last year or at a similar meeting?</li><li> How would they like to feel and what would they like to &ldquo;get&rdquo; as a result of your presentation&ndash;when they leave the room, how will they be changed? <br/>  </li><p> As you can see,  <strong>  you cannot simply intuit the answers to these questions. You must take the time to ask </strong>  the meeting professional who hired you, the movers and shakers who will be in attendance, and other key operatives of the organization. This usually requires an email or fax request in advance, sometimes going over the questions by phone since your contacts will more often than not be very busy people.</p><p> <strong>  Unless you can get answers to these types of questions, don&rsquo;t accept the presentation. </strong>  Without this information, your presentation may hit the mark if you are incredibly lucky, but chances are that you will simply dance around the periphery of what you need to do and say to be successful. If it&rsquo;s a one-time presentation, and you don&rsquo;t intend to do much more speaking, you&rsquo;ll probably be able to get away with this. However,  <strong>  if you want to speak professionally, there is no effective substitute for &ldquo;knowing your audience.&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> 3) Not Arriving With Sufficient Clearance Time</h3><p> <br/> Whether your presentation is across the world, across the country, or across town, <strong>   increase your probability of success by arriving in plenty of time. This may require coming in the night before you&rsquo;re scheduled to present. </strong></p><p> <strong>  When you arrive early, you gain a considerable advantage, which can often be the make-or-break factor in the success of your presentation. </strong>  You get to settle in, calm down, check out the facilities, walk the room, familiarize yourself with equipment, make adjustments, and talk to people. In doing so, you give yourself the edge over the speaker who arrives &ldquo;just in time.&rdquo;  <strong>  Technology allows us to be productive all day long wherever we are &ndash; so arrive early! </strong></p>",

    "link": "5-questions-that-will-help-you-decide-if-you-should-advertise-on-facebook-twitter-or-linkedin",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Is it worthwhile to advertise on Facebook or LinkedIn?&rdquo;</p><p> Facebook and LinkedIn must be sending out lots of incentive emails to get people to advertise, since this is one of the most popular questions we get. The answer is simple&hellip; &ldquo;It depends.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like asking if you should go fishing in the ocean or a freshwater lake. It depends on what you are trying to catch.</p><p> The fact that advertising revenue on social media is expected to increase over 190% to reach $15 billion by 2018 is a good indicator that you are not alone in wanting to fish for the attention of these social media audiences. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are the top three preferred platforms to advertise on, but LinkedIn is not sitting back quietly. You might have received one of their $50 incentives to go fishing on their advertising platform. </p><p> Before you plan your fishing trip and start throwing money at Facebook, Twitter or any other advertising platform, you need to answer these 5 questions:</p><h3> 1. What do I want to achieve with this ad campaign?</h3><p> <br/> Be specific. Do I just want more likes to my Facebook page? Am I trying to get more people to buy my new book or sign up for a course I have coming up?</p><p> Identifying your goals is a critical first step. This will determine which kind of ad you should run and where you will want to run it. To get more page likes you will want to drive people to the actual page, versus a landing page to sign up for your newsletter or webinar. You can use promoted page advertising for likes versus a crafted ad that will show in the newsfeed of your targeted audience on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others.</p><h3> 2. Who do I want to reach?</h3><p> <br/> Again, be specific. Am I trying to reach people in sales positions or perhaps the target market is women between the ages of 30-50 years old living in 5 zip codes in and around Denver? Social media ad platforms are like Google ads, in that you can get very granular with your audience targeting. Getting granular will save you money from having</p><p> Take some time to clarify who you want to target so you are not paying for clicks from people that will not end up converting. If you are targeting all people in the United States, it&rsquo;s almost better to list states individually than to leave the location you want to reach as United States. Many spam accounts will have something in their profile stating United States as an interest even if they do not live in the US.</p><h3> 3. What is the best platform to use to achieve the goals I have?</h3><p> <br/> Do I want to advertise on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram or YouTube?</p><p> One you identify the audience you are trying to reach it will help you know which platform that audience is more likely to be on. If your target market is 35-50-year-old men, advertising on Instagram may not be the best use of your dollars. If your audience is the business executive over the age of 40, advertising on Facebook may not be the best choice either. Know where to lay your dollars down but don&rsquo;t be afraid to test a few of the other platforms to see if you should be fishing there.</p><h3> 4. How much do I want to spend to run these ads on social media?</h3><p> <br/> The good news is you can start with a low budget and gradually increase your ad spend as you discover which ads perform best. Start with a $50 budget or even $25 and test a couple ads. Create a few variations of each ad&mdash;perhaps some with different photos and some with different copy, to see which ads get people to click on them. You can set a cap on your spending so you don&rsquo;t have to fear blowing your budget and getting stuck with a thousand dollar Facebook advertising bill. Run the ad for a set number of days and start measuring. Which ads get results, and which get chalked up to learning? </p><h3> 5. How do I begin?</h3><h3> Here is your starting point on Facebook advertising</h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Facebook-advertising-starting-point.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"running ads on FAcebook, how to create an ad for Facebook\" src=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Facebook-advertising-starting-point.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> Here is the starting point for LinkedIn advertising</h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/LinkedIn-Advertising-Starting-Point.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"How to create an ad for LinkedIn, advertising on LinkedIN\" src=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/LinkedIn-Advertising-Starting-Point.jpg\"/> </a> <br/> Here is the starting point for Twitter Advertising <br/> <a href=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Twitter-advertising-Starting-point.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"how to run ads on Twitter, twitter advertising\" src=\"http://www.socialknx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Twitter-advertising-Starting-point.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Now it&rsquo;s time to cast your line into the water. Just like fishing, it takes the right pole, the right bait and the right spot in the water, but there&rsquo;s no time like today to start! </p><p> If you need help with your advertising or social marketing, let us know&hellip;it&rsquo;s what we do best!</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta find a way to get out of your own way, so you can progress in life.&rdquo; &mdash;Steve Carlton</p><p> How much would you benefit from becoming more self-aware of the behaviors that cause you to stand in your own way? Would your focus change? Could you learn to be more curious, agile, proactive, and prepared to overcome challenges? Here are four ways to get out of your own way so you can thrive.</p><h3> Let go of your ego and pride</h3><p> <br/> First, you must let go of your ego. Your ego and pride will alienate those you need on your side; no one succeeds alone. They will taint your perception of reality. And, they will bias your decisions.</p><h3> Challenge the status quo</h3><p> <br/> The status quo is the enemy of progress. Once you have set aside your ego, you must challenge the status quo. Get comfortable with the idea of change, develop a positive attitude, and stop settling for the status quo.</p><h3> Learn from your mistakes and failures</h3><p> <br/> One of the keys to success is to continually learn; and, one of the best ways to learn is from your mistakes and failures. Now that you have removed the status quo barrier to progress, you need to pull together all of the lessons learned from your past mistakes. Admit vulnerability, recognize where your opportunities lie, and get comfortable with failure.</p><h3> Recognize your weaknesses</h3><p> <br/> Once you have thought through your past mistakes and recognize the lessons you have learned, you must recognize and admit your weaknesses. Again, no one succeeds alone; who will you need to help you accomplish your goals? Surround yourself with the right people and engage others in contributing to mutual success.</p><h3> What Are You Waiting For?</h3><p> <br/> So, how long are you going to stand in your own way? Let go of your ego, challenge the status quo, learn from your mistakes, and recognize your weaknesses. Get out of your own way so you can thrive.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I love holidays of any kind and if the opportunity presents itself to say, &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; to someone I know then I&rsquo;m all about it!  Birthdays, Anniversaries, new babies &ndash; you name it. Everyone loves to have someone see them through the busy-ness of the day.  It feels good!</p><p> It takes time to  <strong>  really </strong>  see that person too, doesn&rsquo;t it? I mean, between the phone calls, emails, and other daily transactions &ndash; we really have to stop what we are doing and write a few meaningful lines to someone.  We want to make an interaction unique, or at least that should be our goal.</p><p> Recently, I reached out to wish someone a happy birthday.  Rather than do it through traditional methods of mailing a card, I sent them a message on a social media account and told them I was thinking about them. I made it very personal too, writing about our last visit together and hoping to hear about their past year. Their response perplexed me a bit, though.  They did say  &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;  (which was nice and let me know they got my message) but then they sent me a link to a publication asking,  &ldquo;Do me a favor and share ____ with your followers!&rdquo;</p><p> Wait&hellip;what?</p><p> Are we really moving so fast that we have to ask someone to help us share something in the same breath we said, &ldquo;Thank you!&ldquo; ?  Are we so much about so-called &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; that we can&rsquo;t let a thank you note rest on its own laurels and then send a separate message requesting our help?  If there was a dislike button when I received that, &ldquo;Do me a favor&hellip;&rdquo; post, I would have pressed it!!</p><p> <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/customer-service-happy-customers-good-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   I saw a stat on Buffer.com that said  </u>  : </a></p><p> On Twitter, over 80% of customer service related tweets are negative or critical of the brand in question,</p><p> &hellip;this is important to absorb. If you or your company is a &ldquo;brand&rdquo;, the fact that 80% of sentiment on brand&rsquo;s Twitter accounts is expected to be negative hits hard, so a positive sentiment should be embraced!  Don&rsquo;t let those moments pass by! That&rsquo;s some good vibes and mojo someone is sending you &ndash; &ndash; you  <strong>  never </strong>  respond asking them to do you a favor.  No &ndash; no &ndash; NO!</p><p> The busy-ness of financial services is ok as along as we still embrace each interaction with a personal touch, especially when it comes to social media.  I couldn&rsquo;t give two hoots about the conformity of brevity in social if it means having my messages make me look more jerky than genuine.  It&rsquo;s simply not ok to be in a hurry when talking to someone; everyone wants a little bit of your time. If you don&rsquo;t have the time to talk to someone, why are you connected to them in the first place?</p><p> It made me really question whether the connection I have with this person is right for my unique audience.  Is this person someone that is helping me grow as a person?  Am I helping them be a better person through my interactions?  Does this relationship still make sense today?</p><p> There are seasons and reasons for everything.  Be sure you know which one you&rsquo;re in with each connection, fan, follower, and friend.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>",

The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/t4cms/WP15_16.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  used an unusual Swedish data source that allowed the researchers to compare the wealth of adopted children with the wealth of both their adoptive and biological parents.

Further, any financial similarity to the biological parents was &ldquo;weak.&rdquo;</p><p> There will always be rags-to-riches stories of talented people pulling themselves up from disadvantaged beginnings. But wealthy parents often give their children a financial leg up by providing generous gifts, such as housing down payments, which prevent their offspring from taking on debt, or perhaps social connections that provide pathways to advancement.</p><p> For those who want to be rich, this study seems to say that having wealthy parents is still the smoothest path to success.</p>",

This feature was added to the social security system in 1975 as a way to protect retirees from the ravages of inflation which can eat away at one's purchasing power. This is no small benefit and can be especially critical for lower income retirees who struggle to make ends meet as it is.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Unfortunately, for only the third time in the past 40 years, there will be no cost-of-living adjustment for social security benefits in 2016. </strong> The other two times this happened were in 2010 and 2011, also as a result of the protracted low inflation environment we've experienced over the past 7 years. Given that over 65 million Americans receive benefits from social security, this zero cost-of-living adjustment will have a significant impact on approximately 20% of the U.S. population.</p><p> The Social Security Act provides for an automatic increase in social security benefits \"if\" there is an increase in inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).  Since there was no increase in that index over the past 12 months ending September 2015, there will be no cost of living adjustment to social security benefits for 2016. Although the cost of living adjustments from 2012-2015 were a modest 3.6%, 1.7%, 1.5% and 1.7% respectively, these adjustments remain a valuable benefit in helping retirees to keep up with overall price increases encountered in day to day living.</p><h3> So what was the primary factor resulting in a zero cost-of-living adjustment?</h3><p> <br/> As you may have guessed it was declining energy prices. The steep reduction in energy costs had a significant effect in driving the overall inflation rate to zero. But therein lies the more important issue at hand. Is the government using the appropriate CPI index as it pertains to measuring cost-of-living for retirees?</p><p> Many groups advocating for retirees have long complained that CPI-W is not the appropriate indicator for cost-of-living affecting retirees. People who work have different spending patterns than retirees. For example, when compared to retirees, people who work spend more time driving (therefore spend more on gasoline) and also spend less on health care and long-term care than retirees. There is no question that cost of living increases for health care and related expenses has increased at a much greater rate, and affect retirees more, than the costs related to energy prices.</p><p> Given that medical care costs are rising faster than other goods, advocates for retirees favor using what's called the CPI-E (E for elderly), which attempts to take into account the different spending patterns for retirees. To that end, Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) has introduced a bill that would amend the current law by requiring the use of the CPI-E instead of the current CPI-W when calculating COLA for people on social security.</p><p> This is clearly an important issue affecting a large and growing sector of our population. Seniors are already suffering as a result of a protracted low-interest rate environment which has held interest rates on CD's and other safe and liquid investment options at historical lows and, as a result, have reduced there income in retirement.</p><p> <strong>  Millions of our seniors, especially our lower income seniors, are suffering as they struggle to make ends meet. </strong> It is unacceptable, I believe, to have a mechanism within the social security system which systematically disregards the cost of living factors which are specifically applicable to our senior population. Let's credit Congress who in 1975 added a mechanism (cost-of-living adjustments) to the social security system to help protect our seniors from rising prices in retirement. Now it's time to refine that mechanism so that we can once again help to take care of our seniors in a more effective and meaningful way.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Let&rsquo;s face it, <strong>  not many people devote much time to learning how to invest their hard-earned money. </strong> It&rsquo;s not really that fun and not at all entertaining to watch your kids&rsquo; college investment fund go up, up and-- then down, down. (Sorry CNBC). The reasons we invest money in the stock market may not be so obvious. One of my best friends is divorced with two adorable kids. They live in a comfortable, albeit, tiny family house. As a single mom, you know my friend&rsquo;s on a tight budget. I&rsquo;m impressed because this woman is brilliant at balancing her volunteer commitments, playing sports manager and working two days a week as a graphics designer. On top of all that, she has a vibrant social life. The glass is always half-full in her view. Now I&rsquo;ve been in the business of helping people understand what works when it comes to investing and managing money for years. And I&rsquo;m pretty good at keeping that conversation simple. So about a month ago the stock market had its biggest drop in four years, and of course, the word panic was repeated across every newscast and news website. On that particular day my good friend blurted out something about investing that I&rsquo;d never heard before, and it stopped me in my tracks.</p><p> She said <strong>  she&rsquo;s out of the stock market. </strong> The headlines are making her sick, and so much drama makes her even less confident about having her serious money in the market. Overwhelmed by the rhetoric, she ranted on that she needs guidance but has no idea who to trust for advice. She&rsquo;s asked, &ldquo;why Bother to invest?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the point? She told me her hard earned savings&mdash;more than $300k from her retirement accounts and divorce settlement is safe in the bank. It <strong>  doesn&rsquo;t earn any interest, but it isn&rsquo;t losing anything either. </strong></p><p> She said, &ldquo;Look, all I want is to make sure I&rsquo;ll have enough so my kids won&rsquo;t have to take care of me financially when I&rsquo;m 80. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all I want to know.&rdquo;</p><p> It dawned on me then and there. She thinks investing is something people do because they want to &lsquo;play the market&rsquo;. To those people investing is a sophisticated game. Clearly, she doesn&rsquo;t SEE herself as an &lsquo;investor&rsquo;.</p><p> What she doesn&rsquo;t see is that she is a real investor, and she&rsquo;s investing for the best possible reason, to take care of the ones she loves, and given how much taking care of her family means to her, she has as much skin in the game as Warren Buffett.</p><h3> <strong>  Reframing how we talk about investing </strong></h3><p> <br/> These insights inspired me to start a movement to change the paradigm about how we talk about investing, and by extension, how we think about investing. Let&rsquo;s reframe the conversation. Instead of viewing it as race to amass the most money, or appear to be in-the-know, let&rsquo;s make it about how <strong>  investing helps us take care of our families. </strong> If you can learn how to pack your kid&rsquo;s lunch boxes, you can learn enough of the basics to build the right college investment portfolio. Investing by its definition is delayed gratification. The payoff comes only after you&rsquo;ve developed the habit of adding steadily to your stock accounts. Wealth builds slowly over really long periods (as in at least 10 years) of time because over the decades stock prices (and your savings) rise more than they fall. You&rsquo;re participating in that growth. That&rsquo;s how wealth happens. The rest is simply taking time to get the right mix of investments to align with your temperament and your long-term goals.</p><p> Speaking of goals&hellip;Women, especially are all about relationships</p><p> Talk to a woman about money and notice how many times the phrase &lsquo;financial security&rsquo; comes up. For us, our kids, and for those in the sandwich generation, it&rsquo;s making sure our aging parents are comfortable financially. Investing is about taking care of any longer-term priorities and in turn, that reduces the stress around immediate money issues. Those are true financial goals and real reasons to invest.</p><h3> <strong>  Getting to your &ldquo;why&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re having trouble identifying what motivations resonate for you, you might like to try a technique called The Five Whys originally developed by Toyota to help engineers uncover the root causes of problems.</p><p> To try it out, think of an important financial goal. Then ask yourself, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and do it five times, progressively getting deeper into your motivation.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><li> I want to invest $500 a month.</li><li> Why? So I can have more money saved.</li><li> Why? Because I want to make that money grow so there will be more of it later.</li><li> Why? Because in a few years, I&rsquo;d like to take my family on some cool trips, and those are expensive.</li><li> Why? Because I love sharing new experiences with them and opening their eyes to the world.</li><li> Why? Because my parents couldn&rsquo;t afford to do that with me and I want to have that connection with them, and share what I&rsquo;ve learned about money with my own kids. That makes me feel like a good mom. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  And that is why we invest money. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investing as a way to achieve what matters most</p><p> Understanding clearly what underlies your goals is a great step toward making them meaningful. When you tap into an emotional motivation, you put the power of your intentions behind your efforts.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If customers include a closing in their emails, it indicates to me that they are friendly, and so I will do their work first.  <br/> <br/> A woman in one of my writing classes made the above comment when we were discussing how to end an email. Others joined in and added that they liked seeing closings in emails they received.  <br/> <br/> I agree. Emails that simply end without some kind of closing can seem too abrupt.   <br/> <br/> During my classes, numerous questions surface about which closing is appropriate in our casual workplace. Deciding what to use can be confusing. When email first appeared in the workplace, salutations or closings were rarely used. Over time, we have added both to our emails. Though there has been some discussion in the  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/the-best-e-mail-signature-is-actually-the-worst\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   media  </u>    </a> lately about whether we need to use closings, in my experience, the majority of people want to keep them. <br/> <br/> I encourage businesspeople to use closings. Here are my six suggestions: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. If you start with a salutation, end with a closing.  </strong> It provides balance to the email. The correct punctuation after the closing is a comma.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Match the closing to the salutation. </strong>  If you use an informal salutation, such as &ldquo;Hi Amanda&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hello Gavin,&rdquo; use &ldquo;Regards,&rdquo; &ldquo;Best,&rdquo; &ldquo;Best regards,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; to close. If you use a more formal salutation, such as &ldquo;Dear Ms. Jones,&rdquo; use &ldquo;Sincerely&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sincerely yours.&rdquo; Only the first word of the closing is capitalized. <br/> <br/> <strong>   3. With no disrespect intended, avoid using &lsquo;Respectfully.&rsquo; </strong>   This very formal closing is usually reserved for government officials and clergy.  Another closing to avoid is &ldquo;Faithfully yours.&rdquo; This wording comes from British English, and a woman from India who was in my class said that she was advised very quickly by her boss not to use that closing in the U.S.    <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. End with a &ldquo;closing statement.&rdquo; </strong>  Since closings are more relaxed in emails than in letters, you can use a brief statement as your closing, such as &ldquo;See you at the meeting&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thanks for your help.&rdquo;   <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Tell people what you want to be called. </strong>  After the closing, on the next line, type your name the way you want to be addressed. If you want to be called &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; you should sign &ldquo;Mike.&rdquo;   <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Once emails become a back-and-forth conversation, you can drop the closing. </strong>  It begins to sound repetitious and somewhat silly if you have a long string of emails all proclaiming, &ldquo;Best regards, Mike.&rdquo; <br/>  </p>",

Exude calm and confidence through voice and body language as you endeavor to establish trust.</p><h3> Tips: <br/>  </h3><li> Greet from a standing position. You do not want to be in the position of sitting while they stand essentially looking down on you.</li><p> Ref:  Peace talks in 1953 with North Koreans:  The North Koreans, who are a shorter people, strategically positioned North Americans on a lower level in a sloping amphitheater in North Korea.  North Koreans sat on a higher level and whenever North Americans would address North Koreans, they would look up to them.  Whenever North Koreans would address Americans, they would look down on them, so to speak.  Physical positioning is important and subliminally powerful.</p><li> Encourage them to sit. Sit after they are seated and sit the way they do.  Become chameleon-like, in order to adapt and subtly let them know you are &ldquo;with them&rdquo;&hellip; you are relating to them.</li><li> Listen with your eyes (and ears).

    "link": "transparency-is-now-the-most-expensive-part-of-marketing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  WHAT MARKETING HAS BECOME. </strong>  Thanks to digital, what used to be considered a sales support, cost center that was really good at \"prettying\" things up is now the revenue generating, ass-kicking investment center that is core to all growth. Why should anyone care? Because no one is used to it - not the marketers, not the people working with marketers, and definitely not the executive team funding marketers. This evolution has caused the value of transparency to skyrocket and those that don't realize it are paying the price.</p><p> Step back and consider what happens when people are faced with uncertainty and change? Questions, emails, reports, dashboards, meetings... and yes, even the dreaded cross-functional committees. You can't blame people for acting this way. Everyone wants to know what is happening, why it is happening, and what we are going to do about it. The biggest problem with this is the cost in time (people doing this work), money (food, meeting spaces, and even unnecessary systems), and opportunity lost (what else could you have been doing). This is the blessed curse marketing now faces and it has created a true premium on transparency. </p><p> <strong>  WORKING WITH OTHERS. </strong>  There is no way around it, in order for any marketing plan to work you MUST communicate with others about what is going on. Why? Because marketing now sits at the intersection of customer service, sales, retention, and technology. Although there are plenty of ways to keep others in the loop, I continue to see marketers more focused on marketing inside of their organization vs marketing outside of it. This is due to not having a hold on transparency. Think about it, for every hour a marketer spends trying to communicate with others, build a report, update a dashboard, etc., is a hour you lose on actually doing the planning, testing, and learning. </p><p> Just in case you think I am advocating for less internal communication, I am not. I have done that in the past and found out how bad things can be when you work in a silo. You find out there is less trust your plans, results, and insights... which means just that many more meetings, status emails, etc. What I am advocating for is taking the time to find the right balance. </p><p> Finding the balance is very, very tough, but those marketers that have figured it out are finding themselves in high demand... not for meetings, not for status updates, but for finding ways to make the company more money. And when you can get your marketers focused on finding more ways to make your company money, you will get to see the true value of marketing in this new digital world.</p><p> <strong>  THE COST OF TRANSPARENCY. </strong>  By just doing some simple math, you can see how an imbalance in transparency can cost you... A LOT. </p><p> 1. Cost of employees - What percentage over 25% (which is an avg from my experience) of your marketer's time is spent on trying to communicate internally? Whatever is over 25%, multiply that times their salary .  <br/> Example: (50% - 25%) x $60K = $15K per year extra spent trying to tell others what is going on.</p><p> 2. Cost of not learning and iterating - If your marketers are spending 50% or more of their time trying to communicate internally, then it is highly unlikely they are spending time learning and iterating on those findings. If you consider what is lost, it is at least 25% better results ( <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/100-conversion-optimization-case-studies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   check out this content to see why I say at least 25%  </a> </u> ... it is probably way more than that). Take your annual marketing budget and multiply it by 25%. This is essentially how much budget you are leaving on the table. <br/> Example: $120K marketing budget x 25% inefficiency = $30K per year</p><p> <strong>  If you have a marketing team of 2 people (@ $60K each) and a budget of $120K for agencies/programs/advertising, you are costing your company 1/4 of your entire marketing by not prioritizing transparency. </strong></p><p> NET. NET. You can not afford to keep transparency off of your a core initiatives for marketing. It is probably costing you more than anything else the team is working on.</p>",

Fintechs are mostly startup companies who want to change the banking experience and the financial industry through innovations and technology. In the process, they hope to make the financial sector more accessible, less expensive, and simpler.</p><p> I firmly believe that Fintechs will change the financial industry the way another innovative disruptor, Amazon, changed the business model of many retailers forever.</p><p> The hottest areas in Fintech, according to a recent report by  <u>  <a href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/fintech-investment-in-us-nearly-tripled-in-2014-according-to-report-by-accenture-and-partnership-fund-for-new-york-city.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City  </a> </u>  (released in June 2015), are payments, lending, trading technologies, and wealth management. The significant interest generated in these areas, along with billions of dollars in investments by banks, insurers, venture capitalists, and tech giants further fuels the explosive growth of the Fintech industry.</p><p> Everything in Fintech is still up for grabs and trends, interests, and emphasis will continue to change as customer and industry demands change.   </p><p> If I had to pick what disruptive financial technology will impact a multitude of fields in the next 5 &ndash; 10 years, I would emphasize two: blockchain technology and cognitive computing.</p><h3> My first prediction: Blockchain Technology</h3><p> <br/> I want to start my predictions by talking about blockchain technology because it already has a huge disruptive influence and impact on innovations in Fintech, financial services, and non-financial markets.</p><p> Many financial incumbents are putting enormous amounts of money and research behind blockchain technology to develop commercial applications.</p><p> They all see tremendous savings and earnings potential by eliminating the need for a &ldquo;trusted middleman&rdquo; as the technology can provide a public ledger of transactions.</p><p> Although most incumbents feel strongly about blockchain technology, it is not yet known what applications and uses will emerge that will finally change the financial industry status quo. I want to stress that financial institutions are still at the beginning of making blockchain technology work for them in the real world. Some of the key challenges and risks are the computing power needed, energy to support the system, regulation, and reliability.</p><p> Those obstacles will eventually be overcome through experimentation combined with collaboration by all market participants. More of the latter will increase the chances of making blockchain technology a reality with a tremendous real world impact beyond what we can imagine today.</p><h3> My second prediction: Cognitive computing</h3><p> <br/> Cognitive computing combines artificial intelligence (AI) with new advancements in machine learning algorithms that mimic the human brain. It allows computers to accumulate expertise, experience, and knowledge in order to participate in the decision-making process and understand and react to natural language. I believe that cognitive computing will have an enormous and far-reaching impact on the financial industry.</p><p> AI applications are successfully used today by many fields including finance, health care, science, and retail. In finance, for instance, AI is already used in cost savings, reporting, and reducing risk. However, cognitive computing will take AI to the next level.</p><p> The Fintech firm who masters the potential of cognitive computing first will have an enormous advantage over their direct competitors, financial incumbents, and tech giants.</p><p> Cognitive computing will change and have a massive impact in every aspect of business and finance. We only have scratched the surface of what cognitive computing capabilities are yet to come.</p><p> Both blockchain technology and cognitive computing will help unleash the true potential of the Fintech disruptive revolution. Their influence and impact will be felt during and beyond the next ten years.</p><h3> My Fintech Bucket List</h3><p> <br/> When I started to brainstorm about the technology that will have the biggest impact in the years to come, I was reminded of the old wisdom among science fiction writers. They always wrote about the present, even though they called it the future.</p><p> Having presented two predictions for disruptive technologies that will affect the industry for years to come, I want to discuss what I&rsquo;d like to see in the future from Fintechs. To do this, I will take a somewhat unorthodox approach and go back even further in the past to capture some feelings and dreams that still hold true today, and will also in the future.</p><p> As the inspiration for a Fintech future - a &ldquo;Bucket List for Fintechs&rdquo; - I compared two science fiction movie cult classics from 1968 which I loved: Barbarella and 2001: A Space Odyssey.</p><p> Barbarella and its heroine, who inspired and influenced pop culture for decades, showed me a sexy fantasy future that seemed so enjoyable and exciting that I wanted to be part of it.</p><p> 2001: A Space Odyssey addressed all the basic fears and impacts associated with technology and artificial intelligence by taking us into space. The excellent directing by Kubrick, the movie cinematography, and special effects were so masterfully done that it felt real. It intrigued us so much that we wanted to know what might come next.</p><h3> Both movies have the essential elements of what financial technology ultimately should be, and aim for. They made us want to be part of an enjoyable, exciting experience and at the same time kept us intrigued and curious, so we continued to long for the future.</h3><p> <br/> Thus, Fintechs, financial institutions, and tech giants will have to provide intuitive services that are sexy and exciting, like Barbarella, and technology that will provide magical solutions as implied by Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey vision.</p><p> As Steve Jobs perfectly phrased it, \"You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.\" Most consumers are not interested in the complexity that lies behind great features and products, but in how those solutions make us feel and how they make our lives easier and better.  </p><p> We know that the digitalization of all industries will stop for no one, and we either adapt to it or watch it pass us. However, I am convinced that the future is not about technology alone, but the combination of technology and human ingenuity since both can benefit from the strength of the other and create a truly win-win situation.</p><p> In the end, we are all well served by thinking and dreaming as big as possible. Even if we falter, we are still further ahead than we were before. Knowing this, I look forward to witnessing the next innovations in the Fintech industry.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We are a society on the move. And because of that, most people no longer live near their families. And because of  that , they rely on social media &ndash; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter &ndash; to stay connected and keep up with all the important people in their lives about all the important stuff. Our fixation and dependency on social media has become a game changer in profound ways. That&rsquo;s the good stuff.</p><p> However, there&rsquo;s a downside to all that social media &ndash; predominately Facebook and Instagram. The effects of social media hasn&rsquo;t always been a good thing and has proven disastrous when it comes to marriage, divorce, and relationships. All the &lsquo;fabulous&rsquo; pictures of people&rsquo;s lives being documented in real time can provoke jealousy among friends and foes &ndash; and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.today.com/money/its-not-just-you-facebook-envy-makes-people-miserable-studies-1C8119557\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   facebook envy  </a> </u> . People focus their time and attention on the wrong thing &ndash; namely other people&rsquo;s lives &ndash; and less on the right places &ndash; their relationship. All this focus on others people&rsquo;s lives negatively affects romantic relationships.</p><p> Mary arrives home from work and after spending a few minutes with her partner, sits down on the couch and spends the rest of the evening posting and scrolling through her friends&rsquo; posts. There is little conversation between Mary and her partner. He tries to engage her in conversation, but all attempts at communication are thwarted. After awhile, her partner gives up. He feel helpless. The message? Facebook is more important that their relationship. </p><p> Laura and Rick were married for several years. They were busy raising two teenage girls. She was a stay at home mom and he had his own business. However, Rick started to notice some changes in his wife that at first glance, he couldn&rsquo;t quite put his finger on. He found himself taking care of his girls more, bringing them to sports practice, and doing more around the house. Then he started to notice some things that were missing. He tried to talking to his wife, to no avail. Although he did&rsquo;t like what he did next &ndash; he did it anyway. He put a tracking device on his wife&rsquo;s car and soon learned that when she said she was visiting friends in her hometown, she was half way across the country with a guy she met on Facebook. He was blindsided. They divorced soon thereafter.  </p><p> According to research by CNBC, there is a correlation between social media usage and divorce rates in the US. The study found that with a twenty percent annual increase in Facebook enrollment, there was anywhere from a 2.18 percent to a 4.32 percent increase in divorce rates depending on the model used. One interpretation is people in problematic relationships may be turning to social media for a support system, increasing the likelihood that marriage will not survive.</p><p> Further, research conducted by University of Missouri School of Journalism, indicated that &lsquo;high levels of Facebook use among couples significantly predicted Facebook-related conflict, which then significantly predicted negative relationship outcomes such as cheating, breakup, and divorce.&rsquo; (Read the entire article  <u>  <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/06/10/facebook-can-damage-your-relationship/55846.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> )</p><p> Its not uncommon that these relationships start due to relationship strife and problems, a spouse/partner feeling isolated, disconnected, and unable or unsure how to make things better. Communication problems and a loss of safety and trust has eroded the relationship. And when there is a new relationship, its hard for the current one to compete against the feelings inherent in a new and clandestine relationship &ndash; fleeting feelings of novelty and excitement, no boredom, coupled with a desire to escape the strife in their life.</p><p> Despite the number of marriages that do end, many couples find a way to work through the relationship problems and get back on track &ndash; if  both  people are vested in the process.</p>",

Hold the complete picture in your mind at all times. This will help to keep you balanced when negative comments are directed your way.</p><p> <strong>  Negotiation includes at least two different viewpoints, several, or the entire objective involved. </strong> Successful salespeople are able to itemize all possible points of contention in order to find an agreeable solution for each. As the improvements are made so are the sales.</p><p> The main point to remember when sitting at the table is to not cave into everything the other party demands for fear of losing the sale. An improved approach is to hear everything out in full, and then begin asking many questions about what was relayed.</p><p> A deeper understanding will reveal a poor past experience or a lack of recognizing on how processes have improved over time.

    "content": "<p> Leadership does not begin when you step upon the first rung of the management ladder. One direct report does not make you a leader; nor does ten. Yet, the moment you have direct reports, you are EXPECTED to lead. And when you fail to demonstrate traits critical to successful leadership, the expectations of your colleagues and subordinates are dashed.</p><p> The previous paragraph embodies a paradigm &ndash; we are conditioned to think about leadership in terms of leading others. Every dictionary bears this out; so does our own experience. We&rsquo;ve seen the power of teamwork. We know the value of inspired employees, and we recognize the importance of uniting individuals behind a common , worthy cause. But, leadership isn&rsquo;t always directing others.</p><h3> Leadership Comes in All  Shapes and Sizes</h3><p> <br/> Think about the millions of people in the workforce who do not have direct reports. Are they expected to lead? Seldom, and at best, never to the degree of those in &ldquo;management.&rdquo; Yet, there are countless examples of sole proprietors, artists, plumbers, carpenters, and bus drivers who demonstrate leadership day in and day out. Superb acts of leadership find indelible places in our minds especially when characterized by high-pressure, courageous acts taken within limited timeframes &mdash; a cabbie delivering a passenger&rsquo;s baby, a pilot landing a jetliner on a river in a busy metropolis, a school teacher protecting her class from a gun-wielding madman.</p><h3> Craft or Career. Which Will It Be?</h3><p> <br/> Decades ago, I was moved by a business school article entitled, &ldquo;Craft or Career. Which will it be?&rdquo; The author, a professor, was making the point that crafts and careers are not mutually exclusive &ndash; that craftspeople do not have to climb the management ladder to realize fulfilling careers. Far too often, organizations discount the leadership value of skilled employees who either don&rsquo;t want to advance in the management pecking order, or wouldn&rsquo;t thrive in that particular environment.</p><p> When I was a CEO, I had the pleasure of working with such an individual, an ambitious purchasing agent who I&rsquo;ll call Walter. Walter measured career development according to one&rsquo;s place on the organization chart. But Walter didn&rsquo;t have the necessary skills to move to the next level. Sensing Walter&rsquo;s frustration, I decided to meet with him. I didn&rsquo;t want to lose Walter because he was skilled at his job and a tier-one team player. So I talked about craft and career, after which, I said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t promise you a promotion, Walter, but we&rsquo;ll do all we can to make you the best purchasing agent in this industry.&rdquo; He wanted to know how. &ldquo;By investing in you,&rdquo; I said.</p><p> In the years to follow, Walter enrolled in supply management courses at some of the best universities. He joined the boards of industry associations, he cross-trained in other departments, and he connected with skilled practitioners of his craft from other companies. Throughout the process, Walter not only advanced his career, he flourished as a leader and mentor.</p><h3> Leaders Influence Directly AND Indirectly</h3><p> <br/> Ultimately, leadership is the ability to influence others. This can happen directly and indirectly. At the most basic level, leadership takes place by example, by watching and listening to artists at work &ndash; by studying their style, their habits, their techniques, their disciplines, and their standards. And if you are lucky enough to come upon an expert who is keen to share his or her tricks of the trade, you will be in the presence of a leader.</p> ",

    "title": "Why a Niche Approach to Millennials Matters",
    "link": "why-a-niche-approach-to-millennials-matters",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We&rsquo;re in the midst of what I would call &ldquo;millennial mayhem&rdquo; &ndash; tons of articles and research about this demographic are being published every day. And I commonly find myself looking at these generalizations and shaking my head in disagreement, thinking, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t describe me at all!&rdquo;</p><p> Everyone is taking a &ldquo;broad brush&rdquo; approach to painting a picture of Gen Y, a group that&rsquo;s the  <u>  largest, most diverse generation </u>  in the U.S. So while many businesses might take note of this millennial craze and try to build offerings based on all this research, they&rsquo;ll likely find a lot of millennials (just like me) where it just doesn&rsquo;t resonate. Not because the research isn&rsquo;t valid, but because millennials want authenticity. Generic marketing efforts without any personal draw or connection will not prevail.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not enough to just do a Facebook advertising campaign (you know, because that&rsquo;s where everyone said all the millennials are). Give me something to connect with &ndash; something that stops me in my tracks when I&rsquo;m scrolling down my Facebook newsfeed, past tons of the other digital advertisements.</p><h3> Different millennial personas</h3><p> <br/> In an effort to better understand the diverse needs of Gen Y and potential niches, I sat down with a team of my peers to define different millennial personas, based on an aggregate of people we actually know. <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/10/Millennial-Chart.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Millennial Chart\" src=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/10/Millennial-Chart.png\"/> </a></p><p> Sure, advisors could just target Ashley (the heiress) or Steve (the pro-athlete) because they came into money at a young age. But are they good prospective clients down the road, based on attitude, drive, and growth potential? What about when you compare them to Chris, that doctor who just ended his fellowship after years of rigorous schooling, who is about to take over his father&rsquo;s business?</p><h3> Consider the HENRYs</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://unitymarketingonline.com/shop/buy-luxury-research-reports/meet-the-henrys-positioning-for-the-mindset-of-the-high-earners-not-rich-yet-mass-affluent-customers-updated-for-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HENRYS (High Earners Not Rich Yet)  </a> </u>  are not a niche, but rather a subset of the millennial population.</p><p> They are:</p><li> At the higher end of the millennial age bracket (about 25-34 years old)</li><li> In high-paying jobs, making between $100-$250,000 per year</li><li> Not yet in a position to build substantial assets, aside from maybe their 401(k)s or IRAs</li><li> Potentially good clients over the long term, because of their career path and drive</li><li> At an age where many life events and planning opportunities occur (marriage, kids, home-buying) <br/>  </li><p> For more traditional advisors targeting the typical pre-retiree or Baby Boomer today, these HENRYs are essentially what your current clients looked like 15-20 years ago. It&rsquo;s just a matter of catching them earlier on in their careers. Think of your existing clients and how much more successful they could&rsquo;ve been if you had advised them earlier on &ndash; before they made some of those first few financial mistakes of their life.</p><h3> Your exponential opportunity <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;ve taken you from the broad daunting  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html\" target=\"_blank\">   83.1 million  </a> </u>  millennials out there <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/10/MillennialsFunnel.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"MillennialsFunnel\" src=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/files/2015/10/MillennialsFunnel.jpg\"/> </a>  to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-are-clamoring-for-a-new-kind-of-ideal-customer-2015-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   24.3 million  </a> </u>  HENRY households. Ultimately though, it&rsquo;s up to you to define your own niche. If you&rsquo;re an older advisor, maybe it&rsquo;s the younger versions of your current niche of clients you already like to work with. If you&rsquo;re a younger advisor, maybe it&rsquo;s someone like your spouse or friends who you already understand and connect with.</p><p> The benefits of niche marketing when applied to the Gen Y, even more so than with any other generation, are exponential because:</p><p> <strong>  1. They&rsquo;re a diverse group with lots of complexities, so you can creatively specialize. </strong>  For example, an advisor could work with young couples trying to start a family, specializing in things like managing fertility costs.</p><p> <strong>  2. They&rsquo;re looking for a genuine brand they can connect with personally. </strong> As Allan Moore said at the recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://finconexpo.com/xypn/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   XYPN conference  </a> </u> , young clients are reaching for their local craft beer, rather than standard beer brands like Bud or Miller Light.</p><p> <strong>  3. Their brand loyalty could morph into a strong referral stream. </strong>  Unlike the Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, who tend to be more private and likely wouldn&rsquo;t tell their friends who their advisor is, millennials love to share their experiences socially.</p><p> Getting started now may just give you the edge over other advisors who don&rsquo;t yet see the value in this group.</p>",

    "content": "<p> During my morning reading, I came across &ndash; yet another &ndash; disturbing article about the financial plight of senior women. </p><p> The Columbus Dispatch article,  <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/10/04/too-many-senior-women-live-in-poverty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;Too Many Senior Women Live in Poverty,&rdquo;  </u>    </a> cites data from the new Census Bureau:  <strong>  12.1 percent of women 65 or older live in poverty, compared with 7.4 percent of men the same age. </strong>  It goes on to tell the story of Marjorie Meyers, a retired 68-year-old woman who routinely has to decide between buying food or medicine in order to make ends meet, despite the fact that she had a great job with the state of Ohio for nearly 35 years and a good government pension.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a story that&rsquo;s becoming too commonplace in our society. Women face harsh financial consequences in retirement, due to the choices they make along the way. In Meyers&rsquo; case, she helped raise a granddaughter and refinanced her house six years ago to help two of her three sons complete their education. In my opinion, that was a huge mistake.</p><p> <strong>  Women care too much. </strong></p><p> The tendency for women to prioritize caring for loved ones over taking care of themselves causes them to make financially irresponsible choices.</p><p> As an example, journalist, author and personal finance expert, Farnoosh Torabi spells out the &ldquo;3 Common Money Mistakes Women Make&rdquo; in this Yahoo Finance video.</p><h3> 3 Common Money Mistakes Women Make </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Mistake #1 &ndash; Harboring guilt. </strong></p><p> It appears than women are more likely to harbor guilt around money than men, due to genetics. Guilty thinking causes women to think irrationally. Have you ever hid purchases from your spouse because you felt guilty? I know I have.</p><p> Another way guilt shows up for women is in the area of parenting. Women make guilt-based choices, such as quitting their job to stay home with the kids, despite long term financial consequences.</p><p> <strong>  Mistake #2 &ndash; Failing to bring in outside help. </strong></p><p> Women have a tendency to believe that unless they &ldquo;do-it-all&rdquo; themselves, they are falling short in their responsibility to be a good care-giver. Studies show that women rank caring for their families above financial goals. This means they would rather compromise their needs &ndash; no matter how justified they may be &ndash;  in order to tend to the needs of their loved ones.</p><p> For instance, guilt will keep women from hiring a housekeeper because of the expense. When in reality (in some cases) bringing in outside help would allow them to utilize their time and energy more efficiently. A simple exercise in doing the math would enable women to make a prudent decision.</p><p> <strong>  Mistake #3 &ndash; Putting others first. </strong></p><p> This is especially true for women who have nurturer-dominant personalities. As a financial advisor, I saw over and over how this was a detriment for women. The tendency to put others first causes women to neglect their own savings, for instance, while helping out children or aging parents.</p><p> Several years ago, a former client, a woman in her early sixties, had an adult child who wanted to buy his first home. He approached my client about borrowing $30,000 from her supplemental retirement savings to go toward his down payment. I advised against it, reasoning that he had plenty of time to save on his own for a down payment, without putting her retirement nest egg in jeopardy. The risk of him losing his job and not being able to pay her back was just too great, especially since she was only a few years out from retirement.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Women+need+to+be+more+self-centered+when+it+comes+to+decisions+that+impact+long-term+finances.&amp;url=http://pattifagan.com/women-and-retirement-too-many-money-mistakes-can-lead-to-poverty/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Women need to be more self-centered when it comes to decisions that impact long-term finances  </u>  . </a></p><p> I believe women need to develop the ability to think objectively. They need to step outside of their habitual thinking patterns in order to make smarter decisions about long term financial security.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Is a business an inanimate object or a social being? </strong></p><p> On the face, it sounds like a ridiculous question. Isn&rsquo;t a corporation simply a piece of paper filed in Delaware? Just a physical entity or the sum of all the 10-Ks and 10-Qs filed on its behalf? In what ways could a corporation possibly be considered a social being?</p><p> Last year a group of cognitive scientists did research to see if there were any differences or similarities in the way that human brains perceived corporations. Regardless of your feelings about corporate &ldquo;personhood&rdquo; the study&rsquo;s results (published in the  <u>  Journal of Social Neuroscience </u>  and profiled in today&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/our-brains-say-that-corporations-are-people-too-1444920667?tesla=y\" target=\"_blank\">   Wall Street Journal  </a> </u> ) make interesting reading for anyone doing brand and business strategy work.</p><p> The study found that <strong>  how we react to the behaviors and actions of people and corporations are strikingly similar. </strong> We process these reactions emotionally using the social reasoning parts of our brain, the same parts of our brains that decrease in activity if an entity is objectified. But the study shows that corporations are not being objectified.</p><p> &ldquo;People apply similar mechanisms of moral reasoning and perspective-taking when evaluating the actions of corporations and people alike,&rdquo; the study&rsquo;s authors concluded, <strong>  &ldquo;in other words, people do not treat corporations as physical entities but rather as social beings. Further, this social reasoning network allows people to form representations of the others, giving rise to decisions about morality and justice.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Corporations &ndash; as far as our brains are concerned &ndash; are not inanimate things, they are beings &hellip; <strong>  they are WHOs. </strong></p><p> What we expect from an entity (a thing) is very different than what we expect from a being (a who). Morality. Justice. Fairness. Purpose. Customers today expect more from corporations than just blind adherence to Milton Friedman&rsquo;s belief that the purpose of business is to make money. Profit is important, but blindly following profit &ndash; at the expense of shareholders, stakeholders, and integrity &ndash; is a mistake.</p><p> Businesses however that focus on more than profit (articulating their purpose and finding shared value) have the ability to access the social reasoning parts of our brains to build emotional connections with their stakeholders, and create Heartspace. As Barry writes in  <a href=\"http://brandforging.co/why-heartspace-is-a-brands-ultimate-goal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;Why Heartspace is a Brand&rsquo;s Ultimate Goal,&rdquo;  </u>    </a> Heartspace allows for forgiveness when a business make mistakes, means one business&rsquo;s products can be preferred over cheaper or even more convenient options.</p><p> Thinking of your business as a social being rather than a thing does bring greater responsibility, but it also brings the potential for greater reward.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You can admit it. Your stomach does rollercoaster maneuvers when you get the greatest weakness question in a job interview.</p><p> I realize there are many job interviewers who think this question yields valuable information. I would rather learn how you could add value to the company. That contribution is more telling than a &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; I can likely help you overcome.</p><p> Regardless, job interviewers will continue to ask this ridiculous question long after I&rsquo;m gone, so before I kick, I&rsquo;d like to teach you how to answer the greatest weakness job interview question. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning what I consider the fourteen best interview questions and how to answer them, download your free  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/books/interview-intervention/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Interview Intervention  </a> </u>  eBook!</p><p> Before we dive in, there are a few key points to remember when you receive this question.</p><p> First, you  should  answer the question because it&rsquo;ll be more damaging to avoid it.</p><p> Second, the words you use when identifying any weakness will determine how the interviewer feels about your weakness. As I like to say, how you say what you say is just as important as what you say.</p><p> Third, no one wins the job interview based on his or her response to the weakness question. Your goal should be not to do any damage to your candidacy with your remarks.</p><p> Lastly, the weaknesses you identify should contain a duality so they could be construed as positives. This will neutralize the downside effect.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look&hellip;</p><p> When you open your remarks, don&rsquo;t use any negative words. Stay away from lead-ins such as, &ldquo;One of my weaknesses is&hellip;&rdquo; Replace the lead-in with something such as&hellip;</p><li> &ldquo;My greatest opportunity to learn is&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;One of my immediate opportunities for growth is&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;One area I&rsquo;ve been working to improve is&hellip;&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Nice. Huh?</p><p> People simply don&rsquo;t like hearing negative words. At a minimum, this phrasing does two things. First, it removes the negativity from what you&rsquo;re about to say. Second, it shows the interviewer you want to improve!</p><p> Regarding the actual content of your weakness, you should identify something that can be construed as a positive. Here are some examples to help you identify ones that might be relevant for you:</p><li> I spend too much time ensuring the details are correct (you&rsquo;re detail-oriented!)</li><li> I need to learn to delegate more effectively (you&rsquo;re a do-er!)</li><li> I know many technologies instead of knowing one extremely well (you&rsquo;re versatile!)</li><li> I&rsquo;m critical of myself (you&rsquo;re conscientious!)</li><li> I plan extensively and am looking for that balance between planning and executing (you&rsquo;re a planner!) <br/>  </li><p> Another option is to identify opportunities for which you&rsquo;ve not yet had the chance to learn but are eager to try. For example:</p><li> I want to learn the marketing function. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always been interested in, but my previous responsibilities focused mostly on sales and product development.</li><li> I want to learn technology xyz, but my previous employer used technology abc. <br/>  </li><p> You get the picture.</p><p> Happy weaknesses!</p>",

The number one reason I have a crush on Sephora&rsquo;s customer service is something quite simple. </strong>   When I went to find their customer service number online, it came up immediately in very large numbers I couldn&rsquo;t miss.   They wanted to make it easy to find them.</p><p> <strong>  #2.

No questions asked. </p><p> <strong>  #3.  The number three reason, and the most important one, is that at no point in this interaction did Sephora try to sell me anything else. </strong>   They wanted to make sure I was happy with my existing purchase.  They know a basic principle of customer engagement: make the customers happy now, and they will come back.</p><h3> In a single call Sephora created an engaging, simple experience and a customer advocate.</h3><p> <br/> For the first time in a long time I took the customer service satisfaction study at the end of the call.  I wrote an online review.

    "content": "<p> Employees can rejoice because, according to SHRM, 35% of companies increased their benefits offerings this year, compared to only 28% in 2014. In addition, only 7% of employers decreased their benefits. But this isn&rsquo;t entirely good news. Digging deeper into many common benefits shows that they can actually come at the expense of employees &mdash; not always to their advantage.</p><p> A corollary to the benefits statistics from SHRM is another stat: pay has barely budged a cent in many sectors of the U.S. economy. Benefits, then, are what companies are using to attract workers and keep them on staff.</p><p> And many benefits sound excellent &mdash; lots of vacation time, a strong maternity leave policy, great health insurance, and even creative things like a concierge desk and maid or car washing services. But you always have to look behind the curtain.</p><p> As we delve into four common perks companies offer, you can see that things aren&rsquo;t always what they seem.</p><h3> Unlimited PTO</h3><p> <strong>  Why they're useless </strong></p><p> Major companies like Netflix and Virgin have started a trend of offering employees unlimited vacation days. But many employees are starting to show that not only is unlimited PTO not a perk, but it can also be a detriment. According to a study by Glassdoor in the  <u>  Society of Human Resource Management </u> :</p><li> Approximately 25% of U.S. employees reported taking all the time off given to them by their employers </li><li> Two out of five employees only took less than 25% of their allotted time off </li><li> 15% took no time off at all  <br/>  </li><p> If, when vacation days are calculated and given out, employees are still not taking time off, companies know that an unlimited vacation time policy will only make employees less inclined to take PTO. Without the specific number in front of them, it will be even harder to ask for a day off unless they work at an organizational culture that encourages them to do so.</p><p> <strong>  Why they're beneficial </strong></p><p> During the first year of the job, it's typically difficult for employees to take the desired time off. Whether it's just a doctor's appointment, a well-earned vacation, or just a mental break, employees don't have the freedom or ability to take care of their personal needs.</p><p> With unlimited PTO, new employees are able to enjoy more work-life balance. Not having a set amount of hours to reference can be daunting and uncomfortable for employees, so it's the manager's job to reinforce the rules. Make it clear how unlimited PTO works and don't forget to encourage employees to take off much-needed days.</p><h3> Employee Wellness Programs <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"anigif_enhanced-buzz-12226-1373987691-23\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/anigif_enhanced-buzz-12226-1373987691-23.gif?t=1445446547328&amp;width=400\"/> <br/> SOURCE: buzzfeed.com</p><p> <strong>  Why they're useless </strong></p><p> Because of new laws concerning health insurance coverage for employees, many companies have turned to the preventative employee wellness programs. On the surface, they seem like great benefits. But often, employee wellness programs are hiding major concerns for workers.</p><p> First, these programs can be discriminatory, depending on how they are used. While many companies offer monetary incentives to employees who take advantage of preventative health activities, such as joining a gym and visiting a biomedical screener, other companies are punishing those that don&rsquo;t participate in these programs.</p><p> For those without the spare income to join an expensive gym or visit new doctors, companies are taking money out of their paychecks. This can easily discriminate toward those with congenital illnesses that don&rsquo;t affect their job requirements, low-income staff, and older employees. There are even cases of people being fired for smoking at home.</p><p> Second, when your company is so tuned into your medical status, there is a high concern for privacy issues. And finally, many companies are raising insurance premiums or adjusting their health care coverage in order to put the impetus into prevention help.</p><p> <strong>  Why they're beneficial </strong></p><p> Surprisingly enough, exercise motivates employees. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1095783/People-exercise-work-days-happier-suffer-stress-productive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Journal of Workplace Health Management  </a> </u>  found that 60% of employees said their time management skills, mental performance, and ability to meet deadlines improved on days they exercised.</p><p> Wellness programs help employees stay focused and get their work done on time. Even if your organization doesn't have a wellness program, you can still encourage employees to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-desk-exercises\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   exercise on the job  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Stock Options <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"giphy_6-2\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/giphy_6-2.gif?t=1445446547328&amp;width=400\"/> <br/> SOURCE: giphy.com</p><p> <strong>  Why they're useless </strong></p><p> There are two common ways organizations can offer employees shares of the company stock: traditional stock options and &ldquo;phantom&rdquo; stocks.</p><p> The former means that CEOs share small portions of ownership of the company with particular employees in exchange for their service at the company. Phantom stocks are common among private businesses that are preparing for an IPO &mdash; they are agreements of a compensation plan offering employees a payout when the company goes public. Both come with downsides.</p><p> In a traditional stock plan, employees must agree to a certain risk. In addition, stock shares tend to be taxable income, which can often result in employees paying equal to the cost of the stock shares in the first place. With phantom stocks, employees will get paid according to what the company&rsquo;s stock is equated at. However, there&rsquo;s no guarantee of what the payout will be, and if an employee&rsquo;s tenure at the company doesn&rsquo;t last until an eventual IPO, the employee receives no money at all. And it&rsquo;s not truly a perk if many employees don&rsquo;t get any benefit from it.</p><p> <strong>  Why they're beneficial </strong></p><p> They entice employees to stick around. Many organizations structure these stock options to accumulate over time &mdash; employees are given a set number of shares and are only eligible to buy them in incriments each year. Not to mention, stocks can potentially become worth a whole lot.</p><h3> Ping-Pong Tables and Other Fun Additions <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"giphy_7-2\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/hubfs/giphy_7-2.gif?t=1445446547328&amp;width=400\"/> <br/> SOURCE: giphy.com</p><p> <strong>  Why they're useless </strong></p><p> In an attempt to attract younger millennial employees, companies are investing in their office environment in creative &mdash; and sometimes extravagant &mdash; ways with things like rock climbing walls, DJ booths spinning tunes, and even ball pits that will remind you of your childhood.</p><p> A ping-pong table can be a small perk, but it doesn&rsquo;t go beyond that without more company investment. Sure, these elements are often great signs of a company culture, but only if the company backs them up with support of its employees. Is that ping-pong table coming at the expense of more vacation time, stronger maternity leave policies, and better health coverage? Or are crazy office perks &mdash; like nap rooms, free massages, and stocked refrigerators &mdash; a part of a larger organizational culture of putting employees first? That varies from company to company.</p><p> <strong>  Why they're beneficial </strong></p><p> Work-life balance. Sometimes employees need just to take a quick break from work and play a game of ping-pong. Even having a fully stocked fridge helps employees stay energized throughout the day.</p><p> When it comes to any company perk, always think about what expense you are getting it. Wellness programs can often mean higher health insurance premiums, promised major payouts can often never be realized, and pool tables sometimes are just pool tables.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Imagine the following scenario: You are assigned to a new team for a project and while <strong>  most of your new teammates are easy-going and friendly people, one person seems somewhat disagreeable. </strong> When you are late to work by a couple of minutes, your colleagues don&rsquo;t seem to notice or joke lightly about your tardiness, whereas this person tells your straight up that being late is unacceptable. Upon completion of an important assignment, you get congratulated by your teammates &ndash; except for this one person who after a quick &ldquo;Good job&rdquo; goes on to tell you about every single mistake you made and how it devalued your work.</p><p> In a situation like this, you are tempted to think &ldquo;That person always picks on me! He/she must hate me.&rdquo; What happens next &ndash; whether you decide to confront your colleague or seek to avoid any contact with him/her, etc. &ndash; is going to be based on your assumption that this colleague dislikes you. However, do you know for sure that your conclusion about the whole situation is right? There are numerous possible reasons why your co-worker acted this way. Maybe they are a very direct person who gives an opinion equally straightforwardly to everyone, not just you. Or they are the type of person to whom rules are important. Alternatively, perhaps your colleague thought of the feedback as their trying to be a good teammate and help you avoid trouble for being late in the future, or help you improve by pointing out things that you didn&rsquo;t get exactly right on your assignment. Assuming that a colleague hates you  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/understand-other-people/201504/is-your-workplace-stressing-you-out\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   can stress you out to the point where you can no longer focus  </a> </u>  on doing your job properly because you&rsquo;re constantly worrying and thinking about it.</p><p> This is just one example of how differing viewpoints, communication approaches and behavioral styles come between people and create divides. The bottom line is that we all fall victim to faulty assumptions from time to time. We create assumptions for everything that we come into contact with; our brains are wired to interpret the things that we experience through different frames of mind, ultimately either broadening or restricting the scope of our comprehension. In any given situation we can use a single frame to look at a problem and mistakenly consider it to be the only right frame. If you don&rsquo;t think this happens all of the time, consider a situation where you went to see a movie with a friend or loved one. Maybe that person hated the movie and you thought it was a terrific one. How can you see things so differently when they see the same thing you are viewing? Because we frame our own filters around things. Maybe your friend hates it when there is no happy ending, but you appreciate how the director managed to create the final, sad scene.</p><p> In the same way, we can view problems with our own &ldquo;angle&rdquo; or frame on it. We may not believe it, but it is possible to change our perception of various issues by switching frames, a process that is also known as &ldquo;reframing&rdquo; or &ldquo;cognitive restructuring.&rdquo;</p><p> The term &ldquo; <u>  cognitive restructuring </u> &rdquo; was developed by psychologist Albert Ellis to help define a behavioral technique used in cognitive behavioral therapy. Today, cognitive restructuring and reframing are frequently used interchangeably to illustrate how people who are adversely affected by a particular situation which they cannot influence can alter their perception of it, which in turn can make things seem more tolerable to them.</p><p> In a workplace setting, where at times it is necessary to work with people that we don&rsquo;t always get along with, reframing is a particularly useful skill to have. It can be used to look at someone&rsquo;s behavior that we respond to subjectively (and negatively!) and shift that perception to a more objective (and positive) one in order to facilitate understanding of the said behavior. Reframing also modifies our emotional state by de-emphasizing our feelings and focusing our thoughts on interpretation of something more objective &ndash; fact-based instead of feeling- or thought-based. Using reframing techniques we can reshape a problem into an opportunity, hostility into misunderstanding, and a deadlock into a breakthrough. By managing our negative thoughts and subsequent antipathetic responses, we can learn to better understand others&rsquo; point of view and accept it as valid.</p><p> Reframing problems does not come easy or naturally to most people; it takes time, conscious effort and consistent practice. The following few pieces of advice will help you master the ability to reframe any negative situation and, consequently, facilitate more fulfilling, stress- and conflict-free relations with other people.</p><li> <strong>  Develop your awareness of frames. </strong> Most people don&rsquo;t even realize they assign meanings to events as they encounter them. Furthermore, these meanings are strictly subjective; what one person may see as a difficult problem, the other person may consider to be just a mild inconvenience, and yet another a major, life-changing event. Everyone has the filters they have accumulated and these filters help dictate our reactions and experiences. Realizing we have filters and frames that connect to them is the first and most important step.</li><li> <strong>  Take a step back from a problem. </strong> Reframing is impossible in a state of deep emotional attachment, because the more strongly we feel a certain way about something, the more reluctant we are to relinquish our assumptions about it. Distancing ourselves from a situation will allow us to judge any problem more objectively, as observers and not participants. Considering only facts can help avoid undue stress that emotions usually bring forth.</li><li> <strong>  Challenge yourself to find alternatives. </strong> Different people will use different frames of mind to form valid perceptions of a problem, but even within one person many frames can have equal validity. Considering alternative frames can help assign new meanings to the events, thus modifying our perceptions of various experiences.</li><li> <strong>  Stop negative self-talk. </strong> While a problem itself may not pose a significant challenge, often times our subsequent self-criticism can exaggerate its gravity to unrealistic proportions. The majority of people are not even aware that their negative self-talk creates a new reality, which has little to do with an actual event. How we word things does matter, and when we think negatively about something, we tend to use stronger language, which in turn can make us feel more apprehensive, angry or annoyed. So instead of thinking &ldquo;I hate my job&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am such a failure,&rdquo; it is better to use more euphemistic expressions like &ldquo;Today was not a good day but tomorrow I&rsquo;ll give it my best.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Practice, practice! </strong>  Changing our customary beliefs and attitudes is not an easy task, but just like everything else &ndash; practice makes perfect. The more we practice noticing the frames that we use to make assumptions, detecting negative thinking patterns and adopting alternative frames of mind, the more positive our outlook on work and life in general will eventually become.</li>",

    "link": "social-media-email-marketing-the-perfect-client-generator",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Econnexx </u></p><p> Social media is one of the most effective methods of attracting new prospects to your firm or business. Email marketing is one of the most effective means of nurturing prospects to become customers/clients of your brand.</p><p> In this post we analyse both forms of marketing activity. We will demonstrate how to automate your marketing using emails and effective social media engagement. We will demonstrate how to merge both activities together to create a campaign that generates clients, sales and revenue on a daily basis through attracting, converting and closing your ideal prospects cost effectively.</p><p> Social media in conjunction with email marketing provides businesses with huge potential for reaching and acquiring new customers. However over 90% of businesses that commence marketing in both these areas give up or fail. In this article, we will explore some of the most cost effective ways of tapping into the world's largest pool of contacts to attract and convert these free contacts into customers.</p><p> Firstly let's look at each marketing activity in its own right:</p><h3> Social Media Marketing</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.econnexx.com/generate-clients-through-social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social media  </a> </u>  provides businesses with huge potential for reaching and acquiring new customers. It is not only an important element of how we now communicate in the modern digital age, it is also the biggest opportunity for businesses who want to achieve growth at a significantly lower cost than traditional marketing. In order to get an idea of the marketing potential and the number of contacts available through social media channels, it is important to firstly understand the size of these modern day market place's.</p><p> Below are up to date social media user numbers for 4 of the largest social media channels as of September 2015:</p><li> 1.5 Billion active Facebook users</li><li> 400 Million active Instagram users</li><li> 380 Million LinkedIn users</li><li> 316 Million Twitter Users <br/>  </li><p> As you can see the user numbers are huge, however, this should not be the reason for you using or adapting one channel over the other. The channels you decide to market through, should be based on your ability to reach your target market / target persona and the cost effectiveness of each in generating you the results you need.</p><p> For example, we know that more affluent users prefer LinkedIn, and also if you are a professional service provider your engagement rate will be higher, Instagram has a young market, but over recent months this has been changing, twitter users are loyal and rely heavily on their chosen channel for info, news and updates, and facebook, has a high usage, something that can be useful for increasing brand awareness. </p><p> There are 3 main ways to generate customers on social media.</p><li> Paid marketing</li><li> Personal engagement with your target market</li><li> Paid remarketing <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Paid marketing / advertising </strong>  is using the advertising platform of a particular social media channel to attract your target market and convert them to purchasing your product or services. The success of this form of advertising varies across sectors and indeed channels. From our experience, we find this to be more successful when selling products rather than services.</p><p> <strong>  Personal engagement </strong>  with your target market, we find to be the most successful form of generating sales for service related business, such as financial services, accountancy services and recruitment services, but personal engagement from the head of Walmart or Tesco is less likely to increase sales.</p><p> <strong>  Paid remarketing </strong> , is displaying advertisements to those that have previously visited your site and demonstrated interest in your product or service. Remarketing is very efficient at increasing your brand awareness, and converting a larger proportion of your target market whether generated via previously paid advertising campaigns or personal engagement. From our experience, Facebook is a fantastic platform for nurturing contacts via remarketing. Generating contact information through site visits our social team will load contacts into a facebook remarketing campaign, should these visitors have a facebook account, our media will be displayed when they visit facebook to reaffirm the brand we are marketing, increasing exposure and conversions.</p><h3> Email Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Our goal for all clients, whether product or service orientated, is to generate and increase sales. However, only a very small percentage of those that initially engage with your brand will buy, therefore it is crucual to acquire their contact details when they engage with you, to enable you to convert a larger proportion of contacts via an ongoing marketing process, the most effective of which is by delivering messages via emails.</p><p> For product related businesses, sending regular emails demonstrating the value of that product will be effective. For services related companies, personal engagement, and demonstrating expertise and authority as well as value in the service will be required to maximise conversions.</p><p> For product related businesses emails from the company brand will be adequate, but for services related companies, personalised emails from the partner, Managing Director (people of position in the business) are going to be more effective.</p><p> There are 4 reasons well-organised email campaigns are successful:</p><p> 1. <strong>  Low cost: </strong>  Using emails to market is very cost effective. Excluding the creativity and design that must be applied to email content, the fact that an interested party subscribes and gives you authority to market further to them, demonstrates a huge potential for conversion.</p><p> 2. <strong>  Measurable ROI: </strong>  Marketing is only effective if it creates a return on investment. Many believe that to market at all requires a huge budget. Our approach at econnexx is to generate client sales using the most cost effective methods of marketing available, then increase the commitment to more advanced strategies, when marketing becomes self-funding. This lowers risk for the client and ourselves. Larger marketing campaigns then become self-funding based on the lessons learned and success gained from previous smaller campaigns.</p><p> 3. <strong>  Personalisation:  </strong> When you gather information from subscribers, you can automatically personalise their greetings and emails. If you wish to send personalised emails for an appointment or sales visit, you can use their first name or full name when addressing them.</p><p> 4. <strong>  Automation: </strong>  Finally the biggest opportunity and reason for the success of email marketing is the ability to automate an engagement process with your contacts immediately after the point of them registering for information on your product or service. With 80% of sales occurring after the 5th time of asking, automating this process to send non-intrusive but information based sales requests, will dramatically increase conversions.</p><p> Once you begin establishing followers and connections, tools such as direct messages on twitter and Inmail messages on Linkedin provide you with the ability to strike up personal relationships with your social audience.</p><p> It is through these channels where you can establish a real interest in your service. By being personal and sending download links to useful brochures and offers relating to your company / brand, or sending a personal invite to join your email newsletter, those who see value will happily opt in and provide their contact details to receive the information you offer.</p>",

    "content": "<p> There's a lot of talk about how much effort a customer is required to put forth in order to complete some task with an organization, whether it's to buy a product, to get an issue resolved, or to do something else. There's even a away to measure this effort, using the customer effort score (CES). If you're not familiar with that, it's a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.executiveboard.com/blogs/unveiling-the-new-and-improved-customer-effort-score/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   metric created by Corporate Executive Board (CEB)  </a> </u> , based on the following questions, using a 7-point verbal scale: <br/> <br/> Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following statements about your service experience, overall:</p><p> - The company made it easy for me to handle my issue. <br/> - It took less time than I expected to handle this issue. <br/> <br/> Through their research, CEB discovered that service interactions are four times more likely to create disloyal customers than loyal customers. <br/> <br/> From their site: <br/> This is because 96 percent of customers who put forth high effort to resolve their issues are more disloyal, but only 9% of those with low effort interactions are more disloyal. Creating low effort customer interactions is the clear goal for the service organization. <br/> <br/> Well, all this focus on customer effort got me thinking about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/09/treat-employees-better-than-customers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spillover effect  </a> </u>  between employees and customers. What about employee effort? How do we measure that? And how does that impact the customer experience? <br/> <br/> I'm not talking about the (discretionary) effort that the employee puts into his or her work every day. I'm referring to the effort it takes for the employee to do his job, i.e., are there processes that hinder their ability to do their jobs in an efficient manner? <br/> <br/> I started wondering... </p><li> What's keeping employees from delivering the great experience that your customers deserve? </li><li> How can we simplify workflows and processes?</li><li> Can we cut out three steps from the nine required to do something?</li><li> How can we become easier to do business with - internally?</li><li> How can we make it easier for employees to do what we ask them to do?</li><li> How do we make it easier for agents to deliver a great customer experience?What complexities, complications, and bureaucracy can we remove?</li><li> How do we reduce effort for employees and then, ultimately, for customers? </li><p> When we make it difficult for employees to do their jobs, it translates to the experience they deliver for their customers. Even if the task the employee is trying to do is not directly related to a customer and his experience, the frustration that effort evokes will manifest itself in the employee-customer interaction somehow. <br/> <br/> Why do we do this? Why do we hire people to fill a role or to do some job and then make it nearly impossible for them to succeed? <br/> <br/> I have a few suggestions on how to turn things around for your employees, and ultimately, for the customer. <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Walk in your employees' shoes </strong> <br/> To really understand the effort they must put forth every day, you do have to walk in their shoes. To do this, create: (1)  employee journey maps , a subject about which Intradiem and I did  <u>  a webinar </u> , or (2) your own  undercover executive  type program, where executives take on the role of the employee. What an eye opener that can be! Once you understand the effort, you'll uncover inefficiencies and be equipped to improve the process. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Pay attention to your employees </strong> <br/> Listen and observe. Listen to what your employees are telling you. Watch how they work. If they say a process is painful or pointless, fix it. Don't brush it aside. If you get feedback, do something with it. If you ignore it, employees will resent you. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Listen to what customers are saying </strong> <br/> When customers provide feedback that their issues were not resolved promptly or properly or that  employees seemed hostile and unwilling or unable to help, perhaps this is on you. Perhaps this is due to processes set forth within the organization. Perhaps it's due to inadequate tools or training. Perhaps there are other root causes that hinder the employee's ability to support that customer in the manner in which he should. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Ensure employees have the tools </strong> <br/> Clearly define their roles and set expectations. Make sure employees have the knowledge, skills, training, and resources to do the jobs you hired them to do and to deliver on what you're expecting of them. Without this, they'll attempt to forge their own path or come up with their solutions - which isn't necessarily a bad thing - but could instead end up needlessly spinning their wheels. <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Similarly, clearly define what a great customer experience looks like </strong> <br/> When employees are spinning their wheels, trying to achieve some moving or unclear target, the effort is extreme and unwarranted. Give them a clear line of sight to the target (customers) and help them understand how to get there. <br/> <br/> <strong>  6. Provide ongoing feedback </strong> <br/> How does feedback reduce effort? The answer relates to #2. If they keep doing what they're doing and are continuing to get the same (wrong/bad) results, first of all, that's the definition of insanity. You don't want to drive your employees crazy! Second of all, if they're doing it wrong and continue to do so, what does that mean for the amount of effort they're exuding? Giving employees feedback - and ongoing coaching - helps to guide them in the right direction, to do things better, to do the right things. <br/> <br/> <strong>  7. Lose the script </strong> <br/> While that seems like a solution that contradicts simplicity, it really can be the root of all evil. If employees stick to the script, they may not really be listening to what customers are saying. Instead of being flexible and personalizing the experience for the specific customer/customer interaction, they are forced to work within this box (script), which really can make it more difficult to deliver a great experience or to find the right solution for the customer. <br/> <br/> <strong>  8. Communication is key </strong> <br/> I think a common thread throughout many of these items is communication, plain and simple. Listen to employees. Talk to employees.  <br/> <br/> I mentioned at the beginning that there's a metric called customer effort score. Is there an employee effort score? Not that I'm aware of. But why should that stop us from measuring and understanding the employee effort. We should ask employees a variation of the CES questions; how about something along the lines of... <br/> <br/> Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following statements <br/> <br/> - The company makes it easy for me to do my job. <br/> - The company makes it easy for me to handle customer issues. <br/> - The company makes it easy for me to deliver a great customer experience. <br/> <br/> I'd include an open-end question so that employees can provide details about their responses and  offer up suggestions for improvements. What else would you add? <br/> <br/> Sometimes it's just easier to sit around spinning your wheels than it is to move forward...but you never get anywhere. -Susan Gale</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Delegation is great. Giving up control, philosophy and initial concept, however, is not. </strong> In marketing, <strong>  delegation is often critical to execution </strong> , but it&rsquo;s also where results can start to break down. So, where is the disconnect that leads to this breakdown?</p><p> Delegation, as a concept, is fairly simple. You hand over a task or job for another individual to carry out. But, <strong>  in order for delegation to work, the people that are being delegated to may require the same understanding as you do of the situation </strong> , as well as the goals and objectives. It seems obvious that the person delegated to should KNOW what they are doing before doing it, but the delegation failure is a recurring and often troubling issue that I hear about far too often. So what is going wrong?</p><p> Delegation can be dictatorial &ndash; and sometimes that is appropriate. But in today&rsquo;s world of collaboration and empowerment, <strong>  successful delegation may take just a little more time in order to create the results you desire. </strong> If you want delegated tasks carried out properly, often you may have to first make a concerted effort to connect with the other person to make sure that they see things from your perspective.</p><p> When delegating, do you give all the information needed? Personally I know that I don&rsquo;t always take the time to give all the details and background about a project. I have assumed that my staff knows or can figure out the rest of the story. Five more minutes used to explain the project may have given them all the information they needed. Sometimes I forgo the five minutes and spend 20 minutes of frustration and another 60 minutes of time cleaning up what wasn&rsquo;t done. And, it was my fault, not theirs.</p><p> So if you are having issues when you delegate, <strong>  try taking those extra five minutes. </strong> Explain any goals, expectations and background information that could be helpful in having the task(s) completed the right way the first time. Give it a try, and you may find that you experience more successful delegation.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I just got pinged some more research from Deloitte, who have produced a fascinating report about the size of the market for the Internet of Things (IoT). Here's the management summary and you can  <u>  download the whole report here </u>  if you want.</h3><p> <br/> Financial services have long trafficked in the intangible, from counterparty risk and online bill payment to things that used to be tangible but increasingly are not any longer, such as stock certificates and even money itself. So all the talk about the Internet of Things (IoT)&mdash;a suite of technologies and applications that provide information about, well, things&mdash;might not seem directly relevant to the way financial services institutions (FSIs) do business. But the IoT may be as broadly transformational to the financial services industry as the Internet itself, and leaders should make an effort to recognize the opportunities and challenges it presents for the financial sector as well as for industries with which FSIs work closely. Notwithstanding the inevitable hype, many industries see great promise in IoT applications: Analysts and technology providers forecast added economic value of anywhere from $300 billion to $15 trillion by this decade&rsquo;s end.1 Few analysts seem to expect anything but a transformative effect on just about every dimension of economic activity by 2020.</p><p> The IoT&mdash;based on the concept of physical objects being able to utilize the Internet backbone to communicate data about their condition, position, or other attributes&mdash;is likely going to matter a great deal. (For an overview, see Deloitte University Press&rsquo;s &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; collection of articles.2) And FSIs can be active participants in this transformation. Indeed, FSI leaders can easily imagine the potential benefits accruing from having more comprehensive, real-time data about their own or their clients&rsquo; physical assets. Some use cases have already proven themselves: Applications such as auto insurance telematics and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; commercial real estate building-management systems offer clear IoT examples of new products or changed processes. Our aim in this report is to go a step further by exploring the IoT&rsquo;s potential impacts on the financial services industry when those effects are hazier. We also aim to help FSI professionals such as claims administrators, portfolio managers, loan officers, and leasing agents understand how IoT applications may change their jobs in the coming years.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As a parent, you want to provide for your children. You want to give them access to higher education, so funding a college savings account is important to you. But you also know that you and your spouse have a financial future to consider, as well. You need to save for retirement.</p><p> When there&rsquo;s only so much money to go around, what&rsquo;s a parent to do? SC</p><h3> The Argument for Putting Retirement First</h3><p> <br/> According to a <a href=\"http://corporate.troweprice.com/ccw/home/pressReleases/pressRelease.do?pressRelease=/html/content/home/pressReleases/pressReleaseContent/03052015.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   2014 study by T. Rowe Price  </u> </a>  on family finances, 52% parents believe that it is more important to save for their kids&rsquo; college rather than their own needs. It&rsquo;s understandable that parents want to provide a solid educational and financial foundation for their children. But the other 48% of respondents have it right:  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-invest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your retirement savings  </a> </u>  come first if you have to choose.</p><p> Why?</p><p> It&rsquo;s up to you to provide for your future. Unlike the aging baby boomers, many of today&rsquo;s young parents can&rsquo;t rely on company pensions for their retirement. Instead,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/401k-vs-roth-ira-which-is-right-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   self-directed savings  </a> </u>  are an important part of being able to pay your bills in retirement.</p><p> You can borrow for college; you can&rsquo;t borrow for retirement. Very few banks will lend money to aging retirees who aren&rsquo;t able to pay their bills. But college students have a range of options in paying for college.</p><p> Students can receive scholarships, grants,  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/whats-the-best-options-for-student-loan-repayment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   and other financial assistance  </a> </u> . They can apply for student loans from the federal government that offer favorable interest rates, flexible payment plans, and even offer loan forgiveness in some situations. And your kids don&rsquo;t need you to foot 100% of the bill &mdash; they can work with you to find affordable college options and they can pick up part-time work.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you prioritize college over retirement, but you plan to catch up when the kids are graduated. What happens if things don&rsquo;t go according to plan? If you suffer a serious illness or extended unemployment, you&rsquo;ll be severely stretched for saving for retirement.</p><p> That might leave you depending on your children just as they are beginning their own financial lives. If you save for retirement and find creative ways to pay for college, you&rsquo;ll allow your own investments to compound more aggressively for a larger number of years. The whole family will end up with more money to go around.</p><h3> How to Fund Your Retirement</h3><p> <br/> Now that we&rsquo;ve established how important saving for retirement is, how do you get started? The first place to contribute is in an tax-advantaged retirement account. The exact type and name of the retirement account will depend on your employment.</p><p> For most employees, the best place to start is to begin putting away money in a tax-deferred retirement plan. Many employers will match some amount of your contributions. If they do, that&rsquo;s free money!</p><p> Stay-at-home spouses can set aside money for retirement in spousal IRAs, which are IRAs where the working spouse contributes income for the stay-at-home spouse. And if you&rsquo;re self-employed, look into a  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/retirement-plans-for-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP IRA) or a Solo 401(k)  </a> </u> .</p><p> Another great option for all workers: a Roth Individual Retirement Account (Roth IRA). When you contribute to this account, you pay taxes on the money you put in. However, when you withdraw the money you pay no additional taxes, even on the new investment gains.</p><p> If investing for retirement seems overwhelming, remember that starting is the most important thing. Just open up the account and transfer in an initial amount to get started sooner rather than later.</p><h3> Making a Plan for College Savings</h3><p> <br/> Paying for college is no easy feat. Even if you aren&rsquo;t able to pay for the entire cost of college, your child can emerge with a strong financial footing by planning ahead.</p><p> Let your children know that the whole family &mdash; including them! &mdash; will need to work together to make college affordable. Students can apply for grants and scholarships to cover large portions of tuition and living expenses. Also, many students benefit greatly from working part time jobs in high school and college.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/06/08/work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Some studies  </a> </u>  even show that part-time work increases student engagement.</p><p> Even if you find creative ways to cut down on the cost of college, you&rsquo;d still like to put money aside when you can towards college expenses. Make the most of those dollars by saving in an  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/13-money-tips-for-parents-to-be/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   educational savings account  </a> </u> .</p><p> The 529 plan is a popular option and allows you choose mutual funds or other similar investments. Other states offer 529 plans that allow you to prepay the cost of in-state tuition. In some state plans, you can contribute over $300,000 towards a single beneficiary.</p><p> Another option is a Coverdell IRA. While the yearly contribution limit of $2,000 is low, the Coverdell IRA legislation does allow for a wider range of investment opportunities.</p><p> These educational savings accounts offer federal tax advantages similar to a Roth IRA. You pay federal tax when depositing the money, but you can withdraw all the money, including the investment gains, without any further taxes for qualified education expenses.</p><p> Some states also offer tax breaks on state income taxes for money invested in educational savings accounts. The exact specifics of the plan depend on your state and the state that runs the 529 plan, so you&rsquo;ll want to do your research to find the best option for you and your student.</p><p> It&rsquo;s possible to both create a secure financial future and retirement for yourself and to help your children start their adult lives with a strong financial footing. Save for your retirement first &mdash; and then get creative about paying for educational expenses.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a young management consultant, I initially struggled to make sales. I tried, as best I could, to copy some of the behaviors that I saw others display when in front of clients.  Unfortunately, my results showed that I was getting nowhere.One of the senior managers, an old hand at sales, took pity on me and one day took me aside and said &rdquo;let&rsquo;s talk&rdquo;. He told me how he&rsquo;d watched me sell, and noticed my results were nowhere near expectations. He then asked me: &ldquo;what goes through your mind when you are in front of a client?&rdquo;.I started blabbering about how I felt self-conscious, wondered if they took me seriously and had concerns around whether what I was saying was actually making any sense at all.He looked me deep in the eyes and said &ldquo;Ago. I&rsquo;m going to give you a little piece of sales advice.&rdquo; <strong>  You&rsquo;re not nearly as important as you think you are. </strong> When I first heard it I thought, &ldquo;what a strange thing to say&rdquo; (my ego was still pretty well-developed back then). But as I reflected on it over the next few days, I gradually discovered the hidden meaning behind his words. What he was saying was that &ndash; in reality &ndash; selling wasn&rsquo;t about me at all. It was about my client.The moment I understood that, my sales results started changing. Gradually at first. But soon, I started getting very different results and started building a reputation as a capable, able seller.Over the next few months and years, I discovered three core principles that to this day, I put into practice in every single client conversation.</p><h3> #1. Practice Better Listening</h3>In spite of all the talk about how sales equals listening, many sellers are still not very good at it. The reason is that they listen selectively &ndash; only listening for clues they can use to launch into a pitch about their product or service. Great listening is part art, and part science. It involves the whole body, as well as the mind. It&rsquo;s all about placing the other person front and center in the conversation, and for a brief moment forgetting about your own agenda.Slowing down the conversation, clarifying and paraphrasing, listening to the emotions behind the words and asking great questions are all <u> <a href=\"http://www.insightsquared.com/2014/03/6-important-tips-for-becoming-a-better-listener-in-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  crucial skills for better listening </a></u>.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0GCxQS7AuF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-21-at-11.50.11-AM.png\" width=\"746\"/></a>Click to view.<h3> #2. Ask Better Questions</h3>The great writer, historian and philosopher Voltaire once said &ldquo;judge a man by his questions rather than his answers&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sure he wasn&rsquo;t dispensing sales advice when he thought of it, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less relevant for those of us in sales and business development.I remember many long meetings in corporate life with the single most valuable thing that I heard an entire hour was a carefully crafted question. Questions have the power to accomplish great things: elicit thoughtful responses, get others to (re)consider their point of view and collaborate with teams and individuals.But perhaps most importantly, questions are an excellent tool to position yourself as a knowledgeable, intelligent, considerate and value adding conversational partner.Fast Company recently published an excellent list of <u> <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3043487/work-smart/how-to-ask-better-questions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  five things to consider when crafting your questions </a></u>.<strong> Questions should:</strong><li> <strong>  Empower </strong>  &ndash; giving others the opportunity to answer them without feeling judged or attacked</li><li> <strong>  Create inclusiveness </strong>  &ndash; related to common experiences in order to help others (re) consider their point of view</li><li> <strong>  Challenge assumptions </strong>  &ndash; they should help us go in with an open mind and ask questions to seek better understanding</li><li> <strong>  Cause the person to stretch </strong>  &ndash; they should invite us to expand upon ideas, explore what is important to us and challenges to &ldquo;think big&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Encourage breakthrough thinking </strong>  &ndash; they should encourage us to find new ways of doing things, or encourage  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-most-valuable-secrets-sales-success-ago-cluytens/\" target=\"_blank\">   new ideas and perspectives  </a> </u>  to come to the forefront</li><h3> #3. Focus On The Other &ndash; Not Yourself</h3>George Bradt, a columnist for Forbes and the author of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2012/09/08/take-care-of-your-people-and-theyll-take-care-of-you/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  &ldquo;Take Care Of Your People And They&rsquo;ll Take Care Of You&rdquo; </u> ,</a> once said &ldquo;One of the most fundamental lessons of leadership is that if you&rsquo;re a leader, it&rsquo;s not about you.  It&rsquo;s about the people following you.  The best leaders devote almost all of their energy to inspiring and enabling others. Taking care of them is a big part of this.&rdquo;He might as well have been talking about sales &ndash; the very best sellers I know have the ability to completely focus on the other, and just for a moment ignore their own selfish needs and desires. It&rsquo;s almost like they lose their entire ego, and become completely absorbed in uncovering the other person&rsquo;s needs and desires, their hopes and dreams.Yet, perhaps paradoxically, by focusing on the other they meet their personal needs far better than if they would&rsquo;ve been focused on their own agenda.As sellers, if we strive to raise the bar and stand out as professionals, advisers and trusted counterparts to our clients, we owe it to them to listen more carefully, asked better, more insightful questions and keep our focus firmly on their needs instead of our own. And that&rsquo;s just about the best sales advice I can give you.  ",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve had a pretty great life so far.</p><p> Of course, there were things that weren&rsquo;t all rainbows and unicorns, like my child who needed medical care for the first few years of her life. There was also the time the company I worked for was acquired, and my lovely job was sold to a big behemoth with values that didn&rsquo;t match my own. Still, all things considered, I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for when life comes crashing down and let me be clear, it hasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s more like I&rsquo;ve run into an unexpected kink in a very curvy wire that has gotten me to where I am today.  </p><p> You may know the feeling. </p><p> Things are going well, you travel, enjoy your job and have a partner you love. At times, it may seem a lot  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/i-want-off-this-hamster-wheel/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   like a hamster wheel  </a> </u> , but you&rsquo;re happy enough to keep going, until the day you&rsquo;re not. Crash.  </p><p> One day, you&rsquo;re minding your own business, running on your wheel, and shit happens. </p><p> Spouse cheats.  </p><p> Fall out of love and get divorced.  </p><p> Lose your job. </p><p> Crash your car.  </p><p> Child gets hurt on the playground. </p><p> Biggest contract goes poof. </p><p> Find out you need to have a bilateral mastectomy even though you felt healthy, and cancer was the furthest thing from your mind. (Welcome to my kink in my perfect life.) </p><h3> What to do when your perfect life comes crashing down?</h3><p> <br/> We never anticipate the crash, do we? </p><p> It&rsquo;s not the crash that breaks us; it&rsquo;s the unwillingness to break the frame and embrace the change instead of rallying so hard against it that you create a forever derailment.  </p><p> It&rsquo;s the frame, struggling to keep you and me safe in the comfort of our lives; that makes us want to scream and yell as it&rsquo;s being pulled apart. </p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair!&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; </p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this.&rdquo; </p><p> Who does want it? Um, nobody. </p><p> Unfortunately, even through a time of pain, you need to find the strength to take out the hammers and the nails and create a new frame, to ultimately move forward with confidence, competence and creativity once again.  </p><p> That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t be sad, or feel the loss, or even anger. You can and you should, it&rsquo;s human.  </p><p> My wise friend on social media,  <u>  Christopher Demers </u>  (@ChristopherinHR) had a brilliant tweet recently that was truly on the mark and definitely hit home. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"154\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-21-at-12.09.24-PM_0.png\" width=\"495\"/> <br/> That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.

The goodness is there for you.  </p><h3> The wrong choice vs the best choice.</h3><p> <br/> There are many times you need to make the best choice you can with the information that&rsquo;s available. Three years later, when you know more, it may become clear that there was a better choice, an easier path to follow. Quite frankly, who cares? </p><p> Making a choice and taking action based on what you know today with confidence is the  <strong>  best choice </strong> . Allow yourself to accept that you made the best choice you could instead of beating yourself up with a terrible losing game of &ldquo;what if?&rdquo;  </p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Best+choices+are+never+wrong%2C+they%E2%80%99re+the+best+you+can+do+in+this+moment.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/life-comes-crashing-down/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Best choices are never wrong, they&rsquo;re the best you can do in this moment  </u>  . </a>   </p><h3> The beautiful thing is that change is up to you.</h3><p> <br/> I know people who have gotten divorced and wasted their next decade as bitter, angry, untrusting human beings.

    "content": "<p> The Greek word  pyr  means fire. Combining the form in English creates compound words that mean &ldquo;heat&rdquo; or &ldquo;high temperature.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> In Mount Clemens, Michigan, when you combine the initials of longtime friends Philip Yamron (PY) and Robyn Ochs (RO), you also get a lot of fire, heat and high temperatures at their glassblowing studio and gallery. <br/> <br/> Born and raised in Michigan, Yamron took an interest in glassblowing early on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hypnotic,&rdquo; he says, much like the way a campfire can mesmerize you.  While he worked in construction and as a plumber, he began taking glassblowing classes in his early 20s. After a while, he realized he wanted to earn his living from the craft. <br/> <br/> He worked as an instructor and also as a glass blower at Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan (http://www.thehenryford.org/village/index.aspx). Today, it&rsquo;s known as the Henry Ford Museum and in addition to the many exhibits, there are Liberty Craftwork Artisans who create works in pottery and glass. From 2003 to 2012, Yamron and six others worked in the glass studio making 125 distinct products. They cranked out 10,000-12,000 pieces of glass work per year for the museum gift shop. It was here, Yamron says, he got the most experience as a glass blower. <br/> <br/> In late 2011, he got a call from a colleague telling him the River of Glass Studio in Mount Clemens was selling all their equipment. The owner was a chiropractor by trade and had the studio on the side. Not being able to devote the time he needed to the craft, he was selling. The colleague asked Yamron to spread the word to other glass blowers he knew. <br/> <br/> In passing, he told Robyn Ochs. Yamron had been her first glass blowing teacher and they had become friends. After some thought, Ochs came back to Yamron with the concept that they should buy the equipment. &ldquo;There are people who tell you about their [small business] and how they fought and struggled to make it all happen. That wasn&rsquo;t the case with us. What happened is that Robyn and I had to make ourselves available and show up for all that was possible. It fell into place&hellip;It was meant to be in a sense,&rdquo; Yamron says. <br/> <br/> The friends now equally co-own the studio on Main Street. The shape of the building still indicates that it was once a gas station. In fact, Yamron says when he and Ochs were first setting up business, an elderly man came by and told them how he had worked in the two-bay station during the 1950s. The man was a teenager then in the famous car-producing state; there was a great drag racing scene and he would fill up the cars. <br/> <br/> Today, gas and electric fuel the furnaces at PYRO Art Glass Studio. The glass furnace burns at 2000 degrees 24/7. The reheating furnace and cooling oven are the only pieces that are turned off at the end of the day. During a cold Michigan winter, it&rsquo;s one of the warmest places to be. <br/> <br/> For those who visualize the state as a scarf and mitten, Mount Clemens is located right in the &ldquo;thumb&rdquo; of the mitten. Detroit is a 45-minute drive south on I-94. Yamron says he knows of nine other small glass studios in the metro area.  He and Ochs do well by continuing to create a wide variety of one-of-a-kind vases, bowls, dishes and decorations. No molds are used. Everything is hand shaped. They sell pieces in their studio and at art fairs around the area. <br/> <br/> Additionally, they pass along their knowledge and love of glassblowing with classes. Students attend three hours a week for eight weeks. Workshops and special events are also offered. Yamron says he and Ochs have a goal to share this unique experience with the public. &ldquo;Most people haven&rsquo;t really seen glass being made before,&rdquo; he notes.  Visitors not only experience the heat, but watch the movement of taking a molten substance and using centrifugal force and gravity to shape it into a solid object. <br/> <br/> Yamron and Ochs are also focusing on building the PYRO business with a product line of glass for wholesale and individual one-off pieces for galleries. In 2014 they were commissioned by Friends of the Clinton-Macomb Library to create  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pyroartglass.com/#!copy-of-installations/cjmm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Soaring&rdquo;  </a> </u>  a suspended sculpture. Asked whether he sees himself as an artist or a craftsman, Yamron spends a lot of time discussing the topic. Of course, he and Ochs are both. However, because he is more of a vessel maker by trade, he sees himself as a craftsman. He says it gives him a sense of pride. Yamron then goes on to explain the spectacular craftsmanship of Venetian glass blowers, masters in the world of glassblowing. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deny that level of craftsmanship,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but all art is subjective. Someone may see a bowl or vase as art.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> In addition to being able to view and purchase pieces at the studio gallery, Yamron and Ochs host two big events a year. One is in October, where the 2015 PYRO Pumpkin Patch showcased 1300 glass pumpkins and gourds and between 400 and 500 visitors came through in a two-day period. &ldquo;We went through 38 dozen donuts very quickly,&rdquo; Yamron said, noting it wasn&rsquo;t the most scientific method for measuring attendance. The annual Holiday Open House in December has tents warmed by the studio furnaces and features glass trees, snowmen and ornaments. Equally large crowds are expected.</p>",

    "title": "Sales Leads: 3 Great Paths to Conversion",
    "link": "sales-leads-3-great-paths-to-conversion",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/knowledgence\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lisa Dennis  </a> </u>  | <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kitedesk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   KiteDesk  </a> </u></p><p> It&rsquo;s common knowledge that all sales leads are not created equal.  Whether generated online or offline, converting a sales lead implies that the lead is fully qualified. Depending who you talk to (marketing or sales) there are many different versions of what constitutes a qualified lead.  In the endless battle between sales and marketing, the subject of lead management gets tossed back and forth like a hot potato. Marketing delivers leads for sales to follow up on, and sales is typically looking for pre-qualified leads &ndash; which can also have many interpretations.</p><p> The line of responsibility around leads can blur.  But it should be simple.  Marketing targets the best fit prospect profiles in selected market segments.  They deliver on the first half of the work:  targeting and lead generation.  Does every lead convert?  Of course not!  Some of them are tire kickers, some of them just want whatever free content you may be providing, and some might be just doing research.  The good news is that they are showing interest and they connected with your company.  Sales needs to winnow down this targeted lead pool to a subset of fully qualified leads.  (The balance should be nurtured by Marketing.)  Conversion starts here.  Let me say that again: Conversion starts at qualification.   </p><h3> One: Qualification Is the Key</h3><p> <br/> A fully qualified lead has a number of moving parts. This might sound like I am stating the obvious. But the reality is that there are literally hundreds of thousands of leads clogging up pipelines everywhere that were never fully qualified in the first place.  Doesn&rsquo;t convert?  Won&rsquo;t close? Start with revisiting your qualification of that lead. And before you succumb to the urge of pointing the finger at marketing, let me state emphatically what every single salesperson needs to wrap their arms around. SALES is responsible for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2012/10/quickly-qualify-to-focus-on-winnable-deals.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LEAD QUALIFICATION  </a> </u> . I&rsquo;ve had too many conversations with reps who tell me the leads are crap and that&rsquo;s why they can&rsquo;t close them. I&rsquo;ve been in both marketing and sales. So I am not pointing the finger at anyone! Each group has its role and conversion requires equal effort.</p><p> Next step:  Go back and RE-qualify the lead. It will either give you what you need to know to move it forward towards conversion, or it will get it out of the pipeline and make room for something that is fully qualified.</p><p> At a minimum you need to confirm the following:</p><li> Is there budget available for the purchase?</li><li> Do I need/have an internal coach to help me navigate?</li><li> Am I dealing with the person who has the authority to buy?</li><li> Does our value proposition connect with their needs?</li><li> Are there time constraints around the decision to buy?</li><li> Who else is on the shortlist and can we counter? <br/>  </li><h3> Two: Simpler Is Better</h3><p> <br/> Making it simple for someone to choose your offer has many facets to it.  In other words, there are many ways to make things simple.  They range from the initial message to the buying experience, and they all count. Nothing is a purchase killer like starting out simple and getting more complex as  <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Tvh-4eKZQdA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the buyer journey  </a> </u>  progresses. Here are four simple approaches that can help speed conversion. (Note:  I mean simple for the potential customer. You will have to put in lots of effort to pull these off.)</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.valueproposition.expert/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Value proposition  </a> </u>  is targeted, clear, and value-based (not feature-based) with quantification and verifiable proof.</li><li> You make it easy to get access to educational, non-salesy, content that provides objective, value- based information that will help the buyer build a case for the purchase.</li><li> Your road map through the buying process accommodates the buyer&rsquo;s own process and is clearly explained before the purchase.</li><li> Delivery, service, and support options are spelled out before the purchase and do not show up as an upsell at the eleventh hour. <br/>  </li><h3> Three: A Sales Lead Decision Is a Jigsaw Puzzle</h3><p> <br/> Depending on the nature of the purchase, there can be a range of decision criteria that need to be addressed in order to convert the sales lead. The more complex and/or expensive the offer, the larger the group of people on the buying team, each with potentially different criteria that must be addressed. Too many organizations rely on a single set of criteria that addresses only one member of the team. Even if that person is the decision maker, not being able to address the needs of the CFO, end-user, or key influencer could spell trouble for lead conversion. To assemble the puzzle is a multi-step process:</p><p> Step 1:    Identify all members of the buying team. <br/> Step 2:    Go back to the prospect&rsquo;s needs and extract potential criteria <br/> Step 3:    Assign the criteria to appropriate team members <br/> Step 4:    Fill in the gaps by asking good questions of your &ldquo;coach&rdquo; or the individual in question, or through research. <br/> Step 5:  Personalize sales messaging to weave in criteria responses.</p><p> Whether the sale is simple or complex, online or off, these steps can be adjusted to reflect the buying process and contribute to the ease of conversion.</p><p> Smart organizations will address all three of the ways presented above to improve sales lead conversion.  But of the three, qualification is the biggest piece as nothing is more counter-productive than trying to convert a lead that isn&rsquo;t fully baked.  Checking your lead qualification steps can help grease the path &ndash; either by adding factors, or tightening the existing ones.  Netting it all out, the probability of converting a sales lead increases the more qualified, simplified, and decision proof you can make your buyer&rsquo;s journey.</p>",

    "content": "<p> For advisors, thought leaders and game-changers, your content&mdash;your body of work&mdash;is a serious asset.</p><p> Successful authors know this. They&rsquo;re used to trading words for money and are well versed in the value of book deals, copyrights and licensing fees.</p><p> But if you haven&rsquo;t published (yet), you may be vastly underestimating the value of the blogs, white papers, videos and assorted training materials you&rsquo;ve spent precious days, months and years developing.</p><p> Not to mention that idea floating in your head. You know the one. You&rsquo;ve been flirting with it for a while but have yet to buckle down and build it out into something tangible.</p><p> It breaks my heart when I meet a talented creator who hasn&rsquo;t quite figured out how to put their works to their highest, best use. To create revenue and&mdash;ultimately&mdash;build wealth from their content.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let that be you.</p><p> Instead, explore your content like you&rsquo;re going on a treasure hunt. Keep an open mind and you just may surprise yourself with the value you have locked away.</p><p> The rule: just because you did something five or 10 or even 20 years ago, doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t still be relevant. Just don&rsquo;t assume all you have to do is dust it off. Times have changed and your work needs to look, read, play and sound current. Right-now modern and up-to-date.</p><p> Okay then. Let&rsquo;s do this.</p><p> <strong>  Destination One: Your client work. </strong>  We&rsquo;re talking about the tools, content and supporting systems you&rsquo;ve developed for your direct (private) client consulting, coaching and teaching. You may have used it 1 to 1 or in group meetings and private workshops, events and training. Note to new consultants: try recasting your experiences as consulting or coaching engagements to fully realize their value.</p><p> Some examples: client presentations, consulting deliverables, worksheets, calculators, projection models, coaching assessments, surveys, private research studies.</p><p> <strong>  Destination Two: Your published content.  </strong> Think anything and everything that&rsquo;s seen the light of day beyond your private client work. This is your public self&mdash;your shared ideas and tools.</p><p> Some examples: blog and guest blog posts, e-newsletters and mailings, videos, articles, books, speeches, public workshops, webinars, interviews conducted or granted, media mentions, digital or physical products, white papers, surveys, research studies.</p><p> <strong>  Destination Three: Your unpublished ideas.  </strong> There may well be untapped gold here, but if you don&rsquo;t get in the habit of jotting down your ideas, you may never uncover it. Keeping your musings front and center tends to encourage synchronicity with the people and circumstances that will bring your best ideas to life.</p><p> Some examples: the book idea you&rsquo;ve toyed with, a new kind of client that might appreciate your work, a new service to add to your repertoire, a potential alliance, a new way to get paid.</p><p> This excavation is something I do with every client, whether they are building an emerging pool of authority assets or have amassed a lifetime body of work.</p><p> It&rsquo;s essential. Because without doing some spadework, you&rsquo;ll never fully realize the power of what you  already  have.</p><p> So&mdash;set yourself the task of exploring your existing content this week. Inventory your assets. Make a master list.</p><p> And then come back to this space next week (or sign up on the pink bar above) and I&rsquo;ll show you how to start unlocking that revenue.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rochellemoulton.com/convert-your-content-into-revenue-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   If you followed my map  </a> </u> , you&rsquo;ve now got a full inventory of your content gems&mdash;from your client work, your published pieces and your ideas-still-in-formation.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve done the prep work. Now you can dive in, assess your works logically AND indulge in a little magical thinking.</p><p> <strong>  Step 1: Look for themes. </strong>  Try taking a first pass through your content collection and marking your most treasured pieces with a star. Don&rsquo;t judge why (yet), just search out your favorites.</p><p> Then, step back and peruse your starred list. What themes tie some or all of them together? You&rsquo;re looking for things like similar topics, or an angle&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;re the consummate devil&rsquo;s advocate&mdash;a type of client, industry or specialty. Be sure to also think outside of the sand box you&rsquo;re currently playing in.</p><p> One consultant presented himself as an expert on multiple generations, but as we dug down, it turns out his REAL touchpoint was the Millennial cohort. Focusing his work more narrowly shot up his speaking fees practically overnight.</p><p> Another had a broad array of PR content for small businesses, the result of working in a smaller city where that was the only game in town. But when she started working with healthcare professionals&mdash;and narrowed her niche even more deeply to integrative health experts&mdash;her practice took off nationally.</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: Do your homework. </strong>  It&rsquo;s not enough to just focus your content on something that makes just you happy (unless you have a trust fund and are dabbling just for fun). You want to ensure that 1) There&rsquo;s an audience for what you&rsquo;re developing and 2) There is a road to revenue that makes sense for you.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not unusual to decide on a topic/audience/specialty and then get discouraged when you discover 30 other people already in your niche. That is NOT a bad thing&mdash;it actually means you&rsquo;ve hit on an existing audience with a demonstrated need. Bingo! Now your trick becomes to find YOUR corner of that niche&mdash;with a compelling and unique message&mdash;to claim your share of the audience.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve hit on your message and audience, you want to explore how best to make your money. This is not to be trifled with&mdash;do both short and long range thinking to ensure any investment you make will support your brand and your business.</p><p> Take the financial advisor with a very successful, mostly off-line, business. Over two years, he built up his on-line reputation by publishing in two prestigious digital outlets as well as starting a weekly blog and developing a commanding Twitter presence. His goal was to create a pipeline into his firm and it&rsquo;s working beautifully.</p><p> But he&rsquo;s also perfectly positioned to develop on-line products&mdash;and yet he doesn&rsquo;t. Why? He has a team of financial advisors to keep busy and a single new client is worth well into five figures every year. The financials and his existing commitments don&rsquo;t pay for him to invest in a different strategy.</p><p> But maybe you&rsquo;re firmly committed to creating alternative revenue streams to your one-to-one consulting, advisory or coaching practice. Then your homework is to pour over everything you can source in your area of specialty.</p><p> Buy a training program so you can see how it&rsquo;s assembled. Take the free webinars and training offered by various experts&mdash;some of whom you may even consider your competition. Soak it in&mdash;and take great notes. Because it will surprise you how many examples and resources are at your fingertips.</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: Lay out a plan. </strong>  Well, &ldquo;duh&rdquo;, you may be thinking. You wouldn&rsquo;t dream of advising or consulting or coaching your clients without a plan. But do you always create one for yourself?</p><p> Exactly. We&rsquo;re not talking multiple spreadsheets here, just&mdash;at least at first&mdash;an outline of what you plan to do, key dates, time commitments and cost. Because it&rsquo;s way easier than you might imagine for this project of yours to turn into a black hole that sucks up your resources without delivering a commensurate return.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s say you decide to focus your content to attract entrepreneurs and business owners with dysfunctional executive teams. You&rsquo;re ultimate goal is to guide them to work together more seamlessly and increase not only revenue, but team harmony.</p><p> Your big-picture plan might look something like this:</p><li> Rework 10 prior blog posts to hit on the five key problems facing dysfunctional executive teams&mdash;and how to solve them.</li><li> Distribute these posts through my social media accounts. Share posts with my posse and ask them to share with their social media audiences.</li><li> Depending on responses, develop a ________(survey, 1-pager, worksheet) to give away on my website to attract more of my target clients.</li><li> Based on feedback from my target market, set up a ______ (survey, webinar, e-course, etc.) to build my digital list with more target clients. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Step 4: Strap on the training wheels. </strong>  Once you have your focus and are drafting your plan, it&rsquo;s tempting to pitch your article idea to The New York Times or your consulting process to Google, but think training wheels.</p><p> Like the plan just above, let the results and feedback from each step inform your next.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve decided to develop an on-line course. Do NOT start with an 8-week foray into every problem your buyer might want to solve. Nope. Try starting with a free email course on one small area your clients struggle with and build a list of people who want more.</p><p> Or begin with a paid course&mdash;think a price point just under $100&mdash;that is short, sweet and reeks of value. You&rsquo;ll spend a lot less development time and then your students will TELL YOU what they want next.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s be 100% clear. Turning your content into revenue isn&rsquo;t something you do in a day if you&rsquo;re just starting to create. But if you&rsquo;ve been steadily building a body of work, simply leveraging it in new ways for your sweet-spot audience(s) can pay huge dividends.</p><p> Whether you need to re-think, re-purpose or just use your prior works as a springboard&mdash;just start. And you&rsquo;ll be one step closer to building the revenue you know your work deserves.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> When  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Alan Mulally  </u>    </a> joined Ford as CEO in 2006, the company was floundering &ndash; to put it mildly. It was 17 billion in the red. Its stock price had fallen precipitously. It was widely expected that Ford would eventually file for bankruptcy.</h3><p> <br/> Mulally&rsquo;s impressive turnaround of the company saw him garner a 97% approval rating as a CEO. The company has achieved a 700% increase in its share price since 2009. Ford has seen the best profitability in decades and shed its junk bond status.</p><p> His leadership style and results earned him CEO of the Year by Chief Executive Magazine (2011), MarketWatch (2010) and Man of the Year by Automobile Magazine (2010), plus a host of other esteemed accolades and awards.</p><p> There are many reasons why Mulally has been lauded as one of the best corporate leaders of our time.</p><h3> <strong>  What was the most powerful action he implemented from the get go? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Setting ground rules around the behaviour expected of his key leadership team.</p><p> PLUS, he had a zero tolerance policy for any deviation from these ground rules. Like a new teacher walking into a classroom of rebellious teenagers, Mulally had all eyes on him &ndash; and a brief window to let everyone know how it was gonna be.</p><p> Did he get challenged? You bet! But, he held steadfast to these behavioural ground rules. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p> In so many organisations, KPI&rsquo;s of senior leaders focus on the &lsquo;what&rsquo;. Profit margin, growth, revenue and market share. In other words, outcomes.</p><p> And, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. The question is more about &ndash; what is missing?</p><p> &ldquo;We respect what we inspect &ndash; not just what we expect.&rdquo; This quote was made for setting ground rules on behaviour with your team.</p><h3> Mulally put as much emphasis, dare I say it, more emphasis on the how. He knew that if they got the behaviour right, the rest would take care of itself.</h3><p> <br/> How the team worked together. <br/> Interacted. <br/> Created trust. <br/> Respect. <br/> Safety to be vulnerable. <br/> To share. <br/> To focus.</p><h3> <strong>  How can we learn from this inspiring story? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here are 6 ways you can create (and enforce) ground rules in your teams:</p><h3> 1. Create a team charter. </h3><p> Do this collectively, but be transparent about the ones that are non-negotiable. Alan and his team had &ldquo;people first,&rdquo; &ldquo;respect, listen, help and appreciate each other,&rdquo; and &ldquo;no jokes at anyone else&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo; Others may resonate more for you and your organisation.</p><h3> 2. Look at ways and places you can demonstrate these. </h3><p> Alan used his infamous Thursday meetings as the predominant platform for sticking to the behaviours they agreed to follow. For you and your team, there may be more suitable ways and occasions for living the behaviours you have set. Meetings, operating rhythms, organisational rituals, processes. Look to every opportunity to live and breathe your leadership charter.</p><h3> 3. He modelled them himself. </h3><p> He held himself to account on these critical behaviours. He gave his team permission to call him on it if and when he fell short. He held his leadership team accountable to the same high standards.</p><h3> 4. Practice zero tolerance. </h3><p> Like children, if you renege once, it&rsquo;s almost worse than having the rule itself. Apparently, if someone started to use their mobile phone in a meeting, Mulally would stop the meeting and ask, &ldquo;Is there anything we should know from that phone call?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The important thing is that we are all accountable to each other. You are accountable to the team, and the rest of the team is here to help you.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5. Make sure everyone knows. </h3><p> Communicating the ground rules at every level is key. Mulally distributed wallet-sized cards with Ford&rsquo;s business plan on one side and 16 expected behaviours on the other, but you may have other ideas to spread the word.</p><h3> 6. Get buy in. </h3><p> Ensuring everyone understands the ground rules and why they are important is vital. Make sure everyone is on the same page. As Mulally said, &ldquo;It is about people working together for the good of all of us.&rdquo;</p><p> How do you create and enforce ground rules in your teams? I&rsquo;d love to hear your comments</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most of us strive for happiness. From a medical perspective, those of us who can be happier, tend to be healthier. But optimal health is not only physical, but is a balance of mind, body, and spirit. In order to begin achieving holistic, optimal health right now, I suggest pursuing the following.</p><h3> 1. Continue to Grow</h3><p> Take advantage of the fact that each day affords you an opportunity to learn more. As you learn, use that knowledge to discover new ways to improve yourself and others.</p><h3> 2. Be Grateful</h3><p> Gratitude goes a long way, and there is always something about which to be grateful. Even if it is only the bright sky on a sunny day, or the nurturing watering on a rainy one.</p><h3> 3. Let Go of the Past </h3><p> People often confuse this with not learning from the past. You can always learn from past circumstances, but you can never wish them away. Wrap your arms around the future and place your back up against the past.</p><h3> 4. Forgive</h3><p> In order to fully let go of the past, you must learn to forgive. This does not mean giving a free pass to the person whom you forgive; it gives you a free pass to move.</p><h3> 5. Be Patient</h3><p> This should not be confused with inaction. Instead, being patient means that your hard work will take time to develop. There is a saying, &ldquo;Overnight success usually takes about ten years.&rdquo; All worthy pursuits take time. Keep moving forward, don&rsquo;t give up, and be patient.</p><h3> 6. Stay in the Moment</h3><p> Our primitive, reactive (automatic) brain causes us to fight and flee danger, such as the unknown. To that brain, the past already happened, therefore you know the outcome, and something known can&rsquo;t be dangerous. So your automatic brain will try to take you there, with emotions as regret. The future is the unknown, so in order to protect you that brain will try to predict it, with emotions as worry.  Staying in the moment, neutralizes this brain and helps you become more peaceful.</p><h3> 7. Cherish Your Gifts</h3><p> We all have them. You may have one; you may have many. The key is to embrace your gifts, strengths, talents and be proud of them. Don&rsquo;t concern yourself with how they rate compared to someone else. Always do your best, without trying to be the best.</p><h3> 8. Listen to Your Inner Guidance</h3><p> In your quietest moments, you usually know what is right. For me, this occurs while I meditate. When you take time to be alone ask yourself questions as, &ldquo;what am I going to do today to make this a meaningful day?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t think about the answer let your inner guidance tell you.</p><h3> 9. Have More Compassion</h3><p> Understand that hurt people, hurt people. We all have challenges and struggles and we all have a story. Even someone who you may feel has more than you faces challenges. Simply having this understanding can help you open the door to a happier place.</p><h3> 10. Be Assertive</h3><p> Being assertive is the behavior of the mind and helps you walk in concert with your personal power, pure potential; what I call, Divine nature. It is not a fight (aggressive) or a flight (passive). It is stating your needs and wants in a straightforward, confident, non-threatening fashion. It means you are not allowing someone or some circumstance to threaten you.</p><h3> 11. Have More Courage</h3><p> When you believe, trust, or take direction from your primitive, automatic brain, it means your reactions are motivated by fear. Rejecting this, thus nurturing courage, opens the door to your mind and our personal power.</p><h3> 12. Stand Tall and Smile</h3><p> Simply controlling your posture and body language causes physiological changes that can neutralize the most primitive components of your brain. Not only does it improve your overall health, but it helps you attract other positive people and circumstances.</p><h3> 13. Take Care of Your Body</h3><p> Keeping your body moving and controlling what you feed it will help remove the barriers to your mind by regulating the electrochemical impulses of your primitive automatic brain.</p><h3> 14. Live</h3><p> I have a saying, &ldquo;While I am still alive, I plan on living.&rdquo; This means that while you are living and breathing here on earth, you should make it your plan and duty to, each day, enjoy, explore, and rejoice in the life that surrounds you.</p><h3> 15. Have More Faith</h3><p> Not only believe more in yourself, but believe in the process of life. Remember you can learn from the past. One thing to learn is that you have survived up until this point, no matter what faced you that you didn&rsquo;t think you could survive. Have faith that you can create a wonderful life and that, whether you believe in God or not, there is energy circulating around that we cannot see or understand; yet, it can help to transform negative to positive; chaos to harmony. </p>",

    "content": "<strong> I wrote a blog post entitled,  <u>  <a href=\"/workforce/dead-man-walking-the-annual-performance-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dead Man Walking: The Annual Performance Review  </a> </u> , jumping with both feet firmly planted on the growing bandwagon of CEOs and senior HR leaders predicating the end of the ineffective and universally despised annual performance review.</strong>Many have proposed throwing reviews out altogether. I&rsquo;m not on that particular bandwagon. We all need feedback. Of course, we all prefer positive over negative feedback. Some of us have a hard time receiving negative feedback while others welcome it and see such feedback as means to an end: self-improvement.In Dead Man Walking: The Annual Performance Review I proposed that the fix lies in creating a better appraisal, one that is tied to job role competencies. We can go a step further. Millennials, who now represent more than half the workforce and growing, view training and the opportunity to experience a variety of roles and responsibilities as the means to self-improvement. Relevant training and experiences that allow them to freely move up, across, or down the career lattice are highly desirable and promote both engagement and retention.&ldquo;Creating engagement strategies is one of management&rsquo;s big goals. But managers who have developed successful strategies for retaining boomers are going to have put those strategies in the corporate archives&rdquo; said <u> <a href=\"http://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/the-millennials-a-new-generation-of-employees-a-new-set-of-engagement-policies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jay Gilbert </a></u> in The Millennials: A new generation of employees, a new set of engagement policies.<strong> &ldquo;Creating strategies to engage millennials requires a whole different approach &ndash; and strategy.&rdquo;</strong>While giving employees the ability to explore different career options by navigating a company&rsquo;s career lattice whether on paper or by application, this alone is not sufficient to achieve a return on the investment in training, mentoring, and otherwise developing employees. There still needs to be a way to assess the efficacy of this investment on employee performance and ensure a positive return.I contend that we must replace the current annual performance review with a systematic competency-based approach to talent management that blends performance, employee career aspirations, and development in one cohesive system putting the employee&rsquo;s career aspirations at the center. There are a number of products on the market today that claim to improve employee engagement by providing a job role navigator and suggestions for training and experiences that an employee might follow to transition from one role to the next. However, these applications don&rsquo;t relate the suggestions back to actual performance required to be successful or the employees future progression path.The very best applications on the market effectively blend continuous feedback, goal management, competency-based assessments, 360 feedback, career path exploration, and development into a comprehensive and cohesive system designed to maximize returns on individual employee investments, driving improvements to the top and bottom lines, and dramatically improving engagement and retention.<strong> When you are searching for a tool to assist in this process, be sure to:</strong><li> find one that links assessment to an employee&rsquo;s talent profile so that you can assess proficiency levels,</li><li> demonstrates all available next moves within their existing department and beyond, and</li><li> serves ups a personalized career development plan.</li>I&rsquo;m open to your thoughts and insights.",

Staying in touch with prospects, following up in a timely and mindful manner and following a customer-centric sales process is something that sales managers need to instill in their sales people so they can succeed to their fullest abilities.</p><li> <strong>  But what if the sales managers themselves don&rsquo;t stick to their process? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What if they don&rsquo;t stay on track to move things along? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What can they do to hold their teams accountable for moving sales forward? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Lead by Example </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s hard to expect accountability from your people if you don&rsquo;t lead by example.</p><p> In my work with many companies trying to establish sales processes and programs, I encounter sales managers who don&rsquo;t stick to their own time-lines far too often.</p><p> In our first meeting they usually have a clear picture as to when they want to implement training, who they want to enroll and what the desired outcomes should be, and why they have chosen this approach to support company objectives and goals.</p><p> We also ask them to have their team complete our online, proprietary Skills &amp; Knowledge Assessment so everyone will know their current skill level and where their learning gaps are.</p><h3> <strong>  Stick to Your Timeline </strong></h3><p> <br/> What sometimes occurs then is a delay in the implementing of that time-line. Not a problem, as long as the reason makes sense for the company, such as restructuring of the team, new team members coming on board, etc.</p><p> It seems to be a trend, and when a pattern begins to take shape, I start paying attention.</p><p> So, in my mind, the question arises: How can sales managers expect their team to be accountable and productive, if they don&rsquo;t stick to their own time-line? It&rsquo;s almost like a parent expecting a child to be courteous while never being polite when interacting with people in front of their children!</p><h3> <strong>  Be Accountable </strong></h3><p> <br/> My European background always kicks in when people make promises they then don&rsquo;t keep. I just simply don&rsquo;t understand it.</p><p> A huge part of my success in sales and business is due to the fact that I always show up on-time, always follow up on what was agreed upon and always follow through on my promises.</p><p> And, there is no difference whether I&rsquo;m dealing with a prospect, a client or a vendor. That&rsquo;s what accountability looks like &ndash; being good for your word.</p><p> On a personal note, just pushing the envelope a bit here, in my subjective and slightly biased view, I&rsquo;ve experienced that it&rsquo;s usually women who keep their promises.</p><p> So, whatever happened to the phrase: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man of my word&rdquo;?</p><h3> <strong>  Create Stellar Performers </strong></h3><p> <br/> So in closing, Sales Managers &ndash; if you want to build a trustworthy, successful team you need to lead by example and stick to the promises you&rsquo;ve made, otherwise it will be hard to expect stellar performance from your team.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As the oldest millennials reach their mid-30s, they&rsquo;re turning their minds to big financial goals, like saving for retirement or their kids&rsquo; education. At the same time, slightly younger millennials are getting serious about their careers and saving for their first homes.</p><p> Whatever stage they&rsquo;re at, millennials are a key demographic advisors should be striving to communicate more effectively with. Start with these tips:</p><h3> <strong>  Encourage research </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many millennials are choosing to manage their own investments rather than work with advisors. There may be many reasons for this, but one that comes up time and again is the idea that millennials are a highly skeptical generation.</p><p> They have more access to instant, high-quality information than any generation before them. They use multiple sources to research everything. As a result, they tend not to take advice &ndash; including financial advice &ndash; at face value.</p><p> On the one hand, it can be frustrating to have every recommendation and decision questioned by a client. On the other hand, shouldn&rsquo;t all clients, regardless of age, be doing their own research and taking some responsibility for their financial education? Encouraging independent research is a great way to build trust with millennial investors.</p><p> Let them know that you support their efforts, and look for ways to balance their findings with the advice you provide.</p><h3> <strong>  Communicate online </strong></h3><p> <br/> The in-depth annual review is essential for tracking clients&rsquo; progress and keeping up to date on their financial goals, risk tolerance and life stage. For most, this review is best handled in person. When it comes to more frequent types of communication, though, advisors should keep in mind that millennials spend a lot of time online. They don&rsquo;t want to meet in person or chat on the phone any more than necessary.</p><p> To stay in touch with millennials, be willing to communicate by email or connect with these clients on social media. If you&rsquo;re not willing to do so, these investors are likely to find an advisor who is.</p><h3> <strong>  Make it personal </strong></h3><p> <br/> That said, millennials are bombarded with email, direct messages and social media notifications. This can be overwhelming.</p><p> Communicate with millennial clients when you have information you truly think they&rsquo;ll want to see. Keep it personal, too. If you come across an article on housing prices in a certain city, and you know your client is looking for a house in that city, send that along. Follow up with ways they can finance a down payment.</p><h3> <strong>  Always use discretion </strong></h3><p> <br/> If your clients just had their first baby, don&rsquo;t terrify them with an article about the skyrocketing cost of a university education. Maybe start with an article on most common baby names and slowly work the conversation toward RESPs. Remember that every piece of information you send doesn&rsquo;t have to be about finance, as long as you&rsquo;re thoughtfully building a connection.</p><h3> <strong>  Think about a digital newsletter </strong></h3><p> <br/> Of course, this tailored communications approach is time consuming. If you only have time for a monthly newsletter, one that goes to all clients, make sure the content is relevant to multiple demographics.</p><p> Also think about adding a personalized opening line. Something along the lines of, &ldquo;Hi Jack. I thought the article on career tips for millennial CEOs might be of particular interest to you.&rdquo;</p><p> With these few simple actions, advisors can capture a larger share of this growing market.</p> ",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CentricDigital\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   David Palmirei  </u> </a> |  <a href=\"http://centricdigital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Centric Digital  </u> </a></p><h3> Companies that offer tools for every stage of digital transformation </h3><p> <br/> With a legacy that includes four former employees who became the President of the United States, Dun &amp; Bradsteet's evolution to big data leader is paradxically surprising and to be expected. One of the original big data companies before big data was a concept, D&amp;B has been providing business data for nearly 175 years. At the advent of the digital revolution, however, the historic company faced difficut decisions.  Ultimately, D&amp;B decided to take its legacy of in-depth business insights and move it online. D&amp;B's leadership committed to revitalizing the stagnated company through real digital transformation. Management understood that to digitally transform a company meant to commit to a process that would continue well into the company's future. The lessons we can learn from D&amp;B's example are a testament to the power of digitally transformed companies.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-22-at-11.24.22-AM.png\" width=\"463\"/></p><p> Real digital transformation is not a terminable program or finite project, it&rsquo;s an ongoing process of reinvention that companies must commit to for many years. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the 175-year old provider of business information, began the successful process of digital transformation a decade ago and it continues today, ensuring the company remains relevant for its customers far into the future.</p><p> Founded in New York in 1841, Dun &amp; Bradstreet is the original &ldquo;big data&rdquo; company. In those early days, the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;reporters,&rdquo; including a young  <u>  Abraham Lincoln and three other future US Presidents </u> , collected business data door-to-door. Today, D&amp;B&rsquo;s massive database, with information on just about every business on earth, is used millions of times a day to make critical business decisions.</p><p> By the mid-1990&rsquo;s, however, D&amp;B had grown into a slow-moving, underperforming holding company of unrelated businesses that included everything from ratings company AC Nielsen, to bond-rating agency Moody&rsquo;s, and even a young technology outsourcing company called Cognizant. To transform the company, management split the company into smaller, nimbler parts that could be closer and more responsive to customers.</p><p> I joined D&amp;B in 2003 shortly after the last of these divestitures and the arrival of a new management team on a mission to revitalize the core business of D&amp;B. Over a decade later, D&amp;B continues to successfully reinvent itself in an ongoing process of digital transformation that offers great lessons for other traditional businesses.</p><h3> <strong>  DEVELOP A DIGITAL-FIRST STRATEGY </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first step in transforming D&amp;B was articulating a clear strategy with digital as a core component. In the early 2000&rsquo;s, it was already clear that information companies needed to become digital, but most of D&amp;B&rsquo;s products were still based on outdated legacy technology. As the new leader of the company&rsquo;s core product line, I inherited a dizzying array of disconnected products and platforms that delivered D&amp;B data via everything from fax machines to mainframes to dial-up modems.</p><p> Rather than continue to evolve these legacy products, we made a clean break. We developed a strategy to move the business from printed reports and installed software to a dynamic, cloud-based, software-as-a-service platform that we called DNBi. This strategy allowed us to focus our previously fragmented product development investments on a single modern platform that was much more flexible, modular, and scalable for the future.</p><p> Internally, this was considered a radical strategy. Customers, however, immediately saw the benefits of a new world-class user experience, unlimited subscription pricing, and a seamless upgrade path to new versions and features. In the course of a few years, we migrated most of D&amp;B&rsquo;s core business to this new platform, driving significant revenue growth and big improvements in customer satisfaction. While moving away from  <u>  <a href=\"http://centricdigital.com/blog/omnichannel-customer-experience/how-omni-channel-experiences-drive-brand-transformation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   old products and pricing models can be hard  </a> </u> , D&amp;B was not afraid to disrupt itself with a bold digitally focused product strategy.</p><h3> <strong>  CREATE A DIGITAL CULTURE </strong></h3><p> <br/> When new management came to D&amp;B in the early 2000&rsquo;s, they realized that in order to transform the business, they would first have to transform the culture. Like many traditional companies, D&amp;B&rsquo;s culture was too risk averse and slow moving to respond effectively to a market that was changing much faster than ever before. Delivering on the new digital strategy would require the company&rsquo;s employees to break from familiar practices and embrace significant change in the culture of the organization.</p><p> The first step in establishing a more modern culture was tearing down the traditional hierarchies and bureaucracy that had developed over many years. Titles were abolished, and everyone at every level in the company assumed the title of &ldquo;Leader&rdquo; of his or her area of responsibility. The title changes communicated a broader idea: that every employee was expected to act like a leader. They were expected to take ownership and think, not just take orders from &ldquo;management.&rdquo;</p><p> The second step was defining what behaviors were expected in this new culture. D&amp;B&rsquo;s &ldquo;Winning Culture&rdquo; model defined Guiding Principles and Rules of Engagement for how employees should interact with each other day-to-day. These principles encouraged more open and honest communication, decisive action, and more &ldquo;challenging up&rdquo; than the old hierarchical D&amp;B culture.</p><p> Finally, D&amp;B created a physical environment that supported the new culture. The old company headquarters, with its wood paneling and private offices, was sold, and the company moved to a new, modern, open floor plan office. Coupled with a rebranding effort that refreshed the company&rsquo;s logo, colors, and brand standards, this new environment sent a powerful signal that this evolution into a new kind of company was real, permanent, and not just a passing fad.</p><h3> <strong>  BECOME AN ESSENTIAL PART OF DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMS </strong></h3><p> <br/> While D&amp;B&rsquo;s original digital strategy was to become &ldquo;an important presence on the web,&rdquo; the first efforts were clumsy at best. The company migrated paper reports to web delivery and acquired Hoover&rsquo;s, a digital native competitor. For a brief time, D&amp;B even managed the business entity verification for SSL certificate provider Verisign.</p><p> Over the years, however, this aspect of the strategy evolved, and D&amp;B increasingly focused its attention on integrating into a wider and wider digital ecosystem. Rather than expecting every customer to come to D&amp;B, even over the web, the company is bringing its capabilities to where customers are.</p><p> One example of this is Data.com, a partnership with Salesforce.com. Data.com integrates D&amp;B data with customer data deep inside Salesforce.com&rsquo;s leading CRM platform and makes the combination accessible to Salesfore.com&rsquo;s ecosystem of app developers.</p><p> More recently, the company launched D&amp;B Direct, an API layer that offers &ldquo;data as a service&rdquo; for others to much more easily integrate D&amp;B data into their applications. It also created the D&amp;B Data Exchange, a platform on which other business information providers can combine their data with D&amp;B&rsquo;s data and organize it around the  <u>  D&amp;B DUNS number </u> .</p><p> By opening up their data to both their customers and a world of third-party app developers and other data providers, D&amp;B is building an ecosystem around itself &mdash; tapping into the creative power of the market to drive innovation from the outside in and in ways that the company would have never imagined alone.</p><h3> <strong>  THE TRANSFORMATION CONTINUES </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the fifteen years since its digital transformation began, the enterprise value of Dun &amp; Bradstreet has increased over fivefold. Today, a new generation of management is driving an updated strategy, under a newly refreshed brand, and an even more open, externally focused culture. The company is boldly embracing the cloud, social media, and its rightful place as one of the originators of the exploding world of &ldquo;big data.&rdquo;</p><p> Not a project or even a multi-year program, real digital transformation, like what D&amp;B has undertaken, is more of  <u>  <a href=\"http://centricdigital.com/digital-transformation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; that companies must adopt  </a> </u>  if they are to stay relevant. The dynamic and powerful example of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a company that turns 175 years old next year, proves the leadership committed to change can create sustainability for an organization and significant value for shareholders and customers.</p>",

    "link": "can-a-reverse-mortgage-pay-for-home-care-in-retirement",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> How do you picture your retirement? If you are like most people, your focus is on having time to spend on activities you enjoy and the people you care for the most. The last thing on your mind is how to pay for health care services if you, your spouse, or partner becomes disabled. While the ideal scenario is to live a long, healthy life, most people have some level of disability during their retirement years. Does it make sense to use a reverse mortgage to pay for home care in retirement to keep other savings intact as long as possible?</p><h3> What is a Reverse Mortgage?</h3><p> <br/> A reverse mortgage is a type of loan which is available to seniors. You would borrow money against the equity in your home. Assuming your home is fully paid off, the equity is the market value of your home. If you have an existing mortgage on your home, your equity is the difference between what you owe on your house and its value.</p><p> One of the advantages to taking out a reverse mortgage is that you do not need to make any monthly payments on the loan during your lifetime in many cases. You do need to be at least 60 years of age to qualify for a reverse mortgage.</p><h3> How Much Can I Borrow with a Reverse Mortgage?</h3><p> <br/> The amount you will be able to borrow against your home will depend on several factors. The value of your property will need to be appraised, and your age is also a consideration. As you age, you will qualify for a higher percentage of the value of your property.</p><p> The amount you can borrow with a reverse mortgage is capped at 40 percent of the value of your property. There is a minimum and maximum amount that you can borrow under this type of loan, as well.</p><h3> How Do I Receive Payments Under a Reverse Mortgage?</h3><p> <br/> You have the option of receiving the funds under a reverse mortgage in a lump sum, as a series of monthly payments, or as a combination of the two. The right choice for you will depend on your financial needs and goals, both immediate and long-term. It&rsquo;s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor before making a decision about how to access the funds.</p><h3> How Do I Repay a Reverse Mortgage?</h3><p> <br/> If you end up staying in your home until your death, the reverse mortgage (including the principal amount and the interest accrued on the amount borrowed) would be treated like a regular mortgage on the property. The house would be sold and the reverse mortgage would be paid out of the proceeds. Any money left over would be paid out to your heirs.</p><h3> Can a Reverse Mortgage Pay for Home Care in Retirement?</h3><p> <br/> The funds from a reverse mortgage can be used for any purpose which makes sense to you, including being used to pay for home care in retirement. Some seniors choose to use to take a lump sum payment to pay out an existing mortgage, make necessary repairs to their home, and/or fund living expenses. Converting some of the equity in your home in this manner can make sense if it means you can increase your cash flow without having to rely on your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or other sources of retirement income.</p><p> Determining whether a reverse mortgage is right for your can be a complicated matter.</p>",

The influential former talk show hostess bought a 10 percent stake in the weight management company, sending its shares up from $6.79 to $18.25 in as few as two trading sessions.</p><p> This is hardly the first time one of Oprah&rsquo;s endorsements, whether verbal or monetary, has lifted a struggling business or product. There&rsquo;s even a name for it: the Oprah Effect.</p><p> No matter your opinion of Oprah&mdash;her politics, her tastes&mdash;you have to admit that she&rsquo;s a phenomenally savvy businesswoman, whose rags-to-riches success has helped make her one of the most powerful women in not just the U.S. but the world. As such, it&rsquo;s important for investors to pay attention to her and other such &ldquo;smart money&rdquo; influencers. Their decisions often have the power to move markets.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s moving gold right now?</p><p> Quite a lot, actually, from widespread doubts of a 2015 interest rate hike, to strong seasonal demand in India and China, to Russia&rsquo;s military action in Syria.

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karenkeller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Karen Keller  </a> </u>  |  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.karen-keller.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Keller Influence Indicator  </a> </u></p><p> You are a new salesperson for a company who sells buses. The owner of the company has been successful for a long period of time. He has a particular sales approach that uses old school methodology that has consistently generated revenue. As you get immersed into the field, you realize there are some sales strategies that need to change, which could amplify the volume of sales. Your supervisor, who is also new to the company, is a sales manager from the medical industry who is always insisting on modernized sales changes, but you watch him get continually shut down by the owner. The owner thinks these new sales methods, while working with your sales manager&rsquo;s previous white collar audience, won&rsquo;t work with the more blue collar transportation managers who authorize bus purchases.</p><p> You want to influence the boss, but in light of your sales manager&rsquo;s failed attempts, you doubt your ability to bring change. What do you do?</p><h3> <strong>  DOMINATE FIRST </strong></h3><p> <br/> To influence change, you first must  <a href=\"http://karen-keller.com/content/building-trust-workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  gain the trust </a>  of those who you wish to influence. A key way to earn trust is through visible results. You can&rsquo;t show results using an approach or system that isn&rsquo;t allowed. You must use the existing tools at your disposal. Donald Rumsfeld once famously stated, &ldquo;As you know, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.&rdquo;</p><p> The reason &ldquo;new ideas, even great ones, are often dismissed is because their issuer has no &ldquo;street cred.&rdquo; To gain credibility, you first need to dominate the existing structure. </p><p> In our story, you (the new bus salesperson) accomplish this by selling more buses than any other salesperson has sold at the company using the existing methods the owner favored. Unlike the new sales manager, you now have skin in the game.</p><h3> <strong>  INFLUENCE THE FUTURE </strong></h3><p> <br/> You are now able to go to the owner and say:</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made you a lot of money this month, but I&rsquo;d like to help you earn more. We have a solid sales system, but there are some improvements I believe we could make to increase profits. The good news is that we have a system I can make work if any of these suggestions don&rsquo;t increase sales the way I believe they will. Let&rsquo;s start by having me implement these new ideas, and if they are successful, we can roll them out to other salespeople.&rdquo;</p><p> The owner says, &ldquo;If you think you can increase sales from last month (which he knows were solid), let&rsquo;s definitely give it a go.&rdquo;</p><p> You have just influenced for positive change!</p><h3> <strong>  BREAKING IT DOWN </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are several reasons dominating the current system before suggesting changes for the future works well. Let&rsquo;s break down the conversation to see why it couples so well with having delivered results.</p><h3> <strong>  Celebrate the Past </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;&hellip;we have a solid sales system&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Every suggested change may be seen as an insult to the past. It&rsquo;s important you celebrate the strengths a company or individual already possesses, and not in a false-flattery way. Find things to celebrate and acknowledge - even about the things you wish to change.</p><h3> <strong>  First Get Results, Then Amplify Them </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made you a lot of money this month, but I&rsquo;d like to help you earn more.&rdquo;</p><p> The reason our sales manager couldn&rsquo;t influence change with the owner is because he can&rsquo;t claim the first statement. It appears he can&rsquo;t sell within the given context. The owner wonders if the sales manager wants the change because he can&rsquo;t cut it and is merely blaming the system. By achieving results within the given system first, you are able to say, &ldquo;I focus on getting results, and I want to amplify what is already delivering for the company.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Mitigate Risk </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;The good news is that we have a system I can make work if any of these suggestions don&rsquo;t increase sales the way I believe they will.&rdquo;</p><p> No one likes to &ldquo;bet the farm.&rdquo; Instead, you are more able to influence the owner by stating that you are setting up boundaries and keeping the existing sales safe. This allows for A/B testing, you against yourself in the previous system, and your new way against the old way maintained by others. This makes it easier for others to buy into the change.</p><h3> <strong>  Take Ownership </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start by having me implement these new ideas&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> You are not suggesting a system that, if it were to fail, you can pass blame to others for not instituting it properly.  You are stepping up and taking responsibility by stating, &ldquo;I am owning my idea, and I will execute it. If it fails, it is because it wasn&rsquo;t a good strategy as the same person using the new system succeeded in the previous system.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Contained Rollout </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;&hellip;if the new ideas are successful, we can roll them out to other salespeople.&rdquo;</p><p> It not only takes energy and effort to get the owner to buy into change, it also takes energy to get the other salespeople to buy into it. By experiencing success yourself, you are able to find some of the forward thinking salespeople and allow them to be early adopters. They can become your advocates and walking testimonials for further implementation.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t produce results from the existing system before influencing change, it can quickly appear that you are merely a whiner or naysayer. Succeed in the current method and then begin having the influential conversations with decision makers acknowledging what is already working, mitigating the risk, taking ownership and using a contained rollout. This also positions you to be the LEADER of the new system, further increasing your value and leadership within the organization. Who knows? Soon YOU may be the sales manager or hold an upper management position.</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the most important skills for leaders to own is their ability to communicate effectively. Although we each may have unique styles of conveying our messages, each message represents who we are and how we are perceived. I usually begin my  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/services/#sthash.5S8vLUfi.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Assertive Communication  </a> </u>  workshops by asking each person to share what they usually get tripped up on when they speak or write. It is always interesting to hear the various responses:</p><p> &ldquo;I feel that I can&rsquo;t always find the right words to use.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I tend to be soft-spoken and sometimes people don&rsquo;t take me seriously.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;My emails are not professional enough and I get called out on it.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I tend to use too many details and then others can&rsquo;t follow what I am saying.&rdquo;</p><p> I am sure you can add your particular challenges with communication and maybe you can relate to some of these replies. We all face situations where we have a difficult time saying what we want to say or even finding our voices. Yet, when we think of strong leaders, we think of strong communicators. One cannot lead themselves or others without communication chops.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Strong+leaders+are+strong+communicators.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/10/19/do-you-lead-with-powerful-communication/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Strong leaders are strong communicators.  </a> </u></p><p> All aboard for strong communication strategies:</p><h3> Choose Authentic Vocabulary</h3><p> <br/> Often when we can&rsquo;t find the right words to use, it is because we aren&rsquo;t being honest with our own choices. Use language that feels comfortable while still being professional. When we try to communicate with another&rsquo;s voice, we will not be successful. Of course, we can change our style at any time to fit who we want to project.</p><h3> Remain Flexible to Different Views</h3><p> <br/> Our suggestions aren&rsquo;t the only way to go, so being open- minded can really elevate our leadership voice.</p><li> Ask for input from all the essential stakeholders</li><li> Incorporate the different perspectives in communicating your ideas</li><li> Be approachable and willing to compromise</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/07/06/five-key-skills-for-new-leaders/#sthash.b2icsFlg.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Avoid judgmental or negative  </a> </u>  word choices</li><li> Swap &ldquo;but&rdquo; for &ldquo;and&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> Know Your Own Body Language and Respect Distance</h3><p> <br/> Think about what you are doing with your hands and body when communicating. Does your body language support or detract from your message? Are you able to maintain a healthy distance between others in a face-to-face conversation? Remember we each have a comfort level of how close we need to stand. What is comfortable for one person may not be comfortable for another. So if you find yourself waltzing across a room when speaking with someone, step back and realize you have invaded their comfort zone.</p><h3> Be Aware of the Emotions on Your Face</h3><p> <br/> Our faces give away our true message so keep them consistent with the words. Good eye contact is critical as it shows we are focused in the communication. Smile when appropriate. Laugh when something is funny. Let your face enhance your communication.</p><h3> Listen to Grasp</h3><p> <br/> How many times have you heard the words, but couldn&rsquo;t read the message? Leaders use  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2014/02/17/prove-you-are-really-listening/#sthash.97wGSqK7.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   strategic listening  </a> </u>  to respond purposefully in an interaction.</p><li> Ask  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2011/07/07/empowering-your-team-to-succeed/#sthash.FK0J806V.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   empowering  </a> </u>  and open-ended questions</li><li> Restate what is being shared</li><li> Nod and lean in slightly</li><li> Summarize to show true understanding</li><h3> Be Clear While Still Respectful</h3><p> <br/> Leaders need to be assertive communicators which means they need to state their needs and wants in a clear way, while still being respectful of the other person&rsquo;s point of view. Clearly share your message with descriptive word choice, while validating the opinions of others.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=When+leaders+are+assertive+communicators+they+respect+other+views.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/10/19/do-you-lead-with-powerful-communication/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   When leaders are assertive communicators they respect other views.  </a> </u></p><h3> Practice Sharing Your Ideas and Voice</h3><p> <br/> As with most skills, practice being a strong communicator. Get feedback from those you trust and try to incorporate some of those honest suggestions into future communications. The best way to become that great communicator is by growing your skills.</p><p> <strong>  What communication strategies have helped your leadership? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  A record amount of entrepreneurs will decide to sell a business over the next decade. If you&rsquo;re one of the business owners looking to monetize your life&rsquo;s work, you may be in for a rude awakening. </strong></p><p> Nearly 75% of the businesses that will go to market will fail to identify an ideal buyer. That&rsquo;s a lot of time, effort and energy put into something that is so important &ndash; only to have nothing to show for all of your troubles.</p><p> There are thousands of reasons why businesses fail to sell when they go to market, and our team at Vesticor has helped clients navigate through these rough waters. But, in order to start your exit journey off on the right foot, there are two very critical questions that can easily determine the likelihood of a successful exit strategy. We thought it might be helpful to share them here.</p><h3> Why Do I Really Want to Sell My Business?</h3><p> <br/> We have witnessed every possible reason why entrepreneurs want to sell their businesses. It can be for health, retirement, travel, changes in the industry or countless others. But, there is usually one main reason that every business owner can lean on to keep them focused on the prize at the end of the journey.</p><p> Having a constant reminder of &ldquo;why&rdquo; you are selling the business is extremely powerful, and the science behind having this vision is tough to challenge. The motivational energy needed to work through rough periods (that come with any exit strategy) can be strengthened by understanding what drives your desire to sell now.</p><p> In a recent transaction, our client (a serial entrepreneur) wanted to sell a business because he desired more time to spend with his other company. This business was growing rapidly and had tremendous upside potential. He needed to devote a full-time effort to this growing business if it was to succeed to its fullest potential, and he needed to sell the business that we represented. The &ldquo;why&rdquo; for him was to free up his time to build something even greater, and this motivation gave him the strength to power through a couple of obstacles and roadblocks that came along with the transaction. We were able to find a large strategic buyer, and he was able to devote more energy on a business that gave him more excitement.</p><p> Knowing your &ldquo;why&rdquo; will fuel ambition and inspiration around the one thing that is the most important to you, and will help move your transaction forward.</p><h3> What Will I Spend My Time Doing After I Sell My Business?</h3><p> <br/> When someone comes to us for the first time, we like to ask them to share their vision of what an ideal day would look like after they sell their business. The answers are a clear look into what motivation they have to make the commitment to sell in the first place.</p><p> We just finished representing an owner who spent the last 20 years building his business to a top spot in his industry. He worked hard for this position, but couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about moving to a warmer climate and spending time with his wife on their new boat. He went into great detail on what his ideal day would look like out at sea, and we knew that he was ready to make the commitment to meet with our buyers.</p><p> The main reason that most businesses fail to find a buyer is because the seller is missing some type of motivation to make it happen. A seller that lacks the proper motivation to work toward closing the transaction will likely never get to experience the thrill that comes with selling something that they built with their own hard work and dedication.</p><p> If you cannot get really motivated by the wealth and change of scenery that will come from selling a business, then chances are that it&rsquo;s just not the right time to sell.</p><p> The process of selling a business can be a ball of emotions all rolled into one experience. If your not truly motivated to move onto the next chapter in your life, then buyers will sense this lack of motivation and they will move onto another business.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_burdon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mark Burdon  </u> </a> | <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Hire-Vue  </u> </a></p><p> In the hallowed halls of unsung heroes, the Inside Sales Representative holds a special place. </p><p> Less celebrated than the Field Sales Executive, or the Director of Business Development, the Inside Sales guy (or gal) is the \"Oracle\" to the field sales \"Batman\". He or she can become invaluable taking care of business from the home base. Though many telesales professionals may have had experience in the field, just like Barbara Gordon did as Batgirl, they have honed a set of inside sales best practices to deliver value to customers and their colleagues. </p><li> Keeping the senior sales rep informed of inbound opportunities</li><li> Resolving any customer satisfaction issues </li><li> Getting intel on the competition, or the \"villians\" of the sales process</li><li> Acting as an information broker, and setting up sales appointments for their field counterparts  <br/>  </li><p> LIke any great sidekick, a skilled Inside Sales professional may not command the headlines, or get the glory. Yet when the Senior Sales professionals are out hunting big game and net new customer deals, there are many ways the Inside Sales team can maintain the existing client base, and harvest smaller, strategic transactions. </p><p> Here are five inside sales best practices which will help your team keep focused, motivated and working towards a common goal with their face to face sales colleagues. </p><h3> 1. Focus on the Right Success Metrics</h3><p> <br/> \"Sales is a numbers game, the more calls you make, the better chance you'll have to generate revenue!\"</p><p> \"If you aren't connecting with your customer on the third attempt, just try five more times! You just have to get them at the right time!\"</p><p> The best inside sales team don't necessarily make a higher quantity of calls. It is more often demoralizing when you try to \"smile and dial\" a random set of people. Quality calls, as is often the case, trumps quantity.</p><p> Warm up cold calls by</p><li> Researching a set of prospective clients</li><li> Finding the right people in the organization who to talk to</li><li> Making my goal of calling an appointment, not a hail mary closed deal</li><li> Understanding the strategic benefits of my solution to the client, and how to position them</li><li> Establishing and nurturing relationships and building trust, don't sell once and leave a path of wreckage</li><li> Working with your marketing counterparts to develop reasons to call, beyond just a quick sale <br/>  </li><p> Many companies are more interested in reps who are busy, instead of an inside sales team that is productive. </p><h3> 2. Leverage Inside Sales to Maintain Relationships </h3><p> <br/> Using your  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/the-growing-power-of-inside-sa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   inside sales team  </a> </u>  to only try and \"shake the trees\" for new leads can backfire. If your company sells high priced products with long sales cycles, consider assigning the responsibility of working with existing customers, business partners, or working to onboard newly signed clients who need some extra TLC in their early stages of their relationship with your company.</p><p> The proximity of the inside sales team to the operations teams within your organizations can be beneficial to get approvals,access subject matter experts, and to be as responsive as possible to inbound inquiries. </p><h3> 3. Ensure Co-Operation, Not Competition</h3><p> <br/> If your telesales reps feel like they are competing with their fellow inside sales reps, or counterparts in the field, you are setting your company up for infighting, confusion, and potential embarrssment in front of the client. Make sure you establish: </p><li> Clear rules of engagement on territories, deal sizes and any \"named accounts\" which are protected by specific sales reps</li><li> Create incentives for collaboration between inside sales and field reps. If an inside rep uncovers a high value opportunity which closes for significant revenue, have a Sales Program Incentive Fund for celebrating the role the telesales rep played in identifying, and qualifying the lead before passing it to the field </li><li> If there are opportunities for inside reps to go on \"ride alongs\" into the field on occaision to learn from their colleagues, make it happen! Ride alongs are a great mentorship opportunity for sales managers for their reps, and equally so from field sales with their inside sales colleagues, <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Educate Your Marketing and Management Teams</h3><p> <br/> A great way for your marketing team on what prospects and/or existing customers are saying when approached by your sales team is to have them listen in to customer calls Inside sales calls are a great way to</p><li> Improve your presentation materials for webinars</li><li> Get feedback on the effectiveness of your web presence,</li><li> Honing your customer messaging on social media based on real client conversations  <br/>  </li><p> If you manage an inside sales team, you should take the time to sit in on customer calls with your reps. Not just to seek out mentoring opportunities with your reps, but also to get an understanding what customers are looking for, and to see what works and what needs improvement. If you listen in on a particularily challenging call, you can use it as a coaching scenario for your next  <u>  HireVue Accelerate </u>  session. </p><h3> 5. Leveraging Your Calendar and CRM to Their Potential</h3><p> <br/> Determining the best time for your team to call clients can help them to optimize their odds of reaching a customer live. Calling a prospective client on a Thursday is often the best day to reach a person live, and in many cases calling early in the morning is the best time to reach a decision maker. Once your reps make initial contact with a high value prospect, they can schedule an appointment for a different day and time.  </p><p> Since your telesales reps tend to make the highest number of calls, web chat conversations and e-mails, documenting these conversations can be a very valuable source of customer intelligence for your company. Ensuring your cloud CRM solution makes it easy to capture calls and e-mails is vital. Expanding the roster of contacts you have in your marketing list is valuable, as is understanding the org chart of your prospects and existing customers. </p><p> Adhering to inside sales best practices like these can be extremely effective to:</p><li> Close high volume, lower revenue transactions</li><li> Nurturing partner and customer relationships </li><li> Improving your customer and prospective client intelligence <br/>  </li><p> Recognizing the strategic value of your telesales reps, and mentoring them to retain and grow their skills can pay great dividends to your company over the long term. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VHLawGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Chad Van Horn  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.vanhornlawgroup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Van Horn Law Group  </u> </a> Student loan collection scammers are everywhere. Even my mother has been the target of these lowlifes! She received a text saying, \"WARNING: Call 855-425-7023 as your student loan account has been red flagged.\"  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wwmt.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/Scam-alert-for-anyone-with-student-loans-211804.shtml#.Vg6CwtZwuLM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   It&rsquo;s been reported  </a> </u>  that calling this number gets you someone claiming to be from the Department of Education or even from the FBI, and they&rsquo;re demanding money. This is obviously not the case. A fast Google search for this number turns up plenty of complaints, and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.okcaller.com/detail.php?number=855-425-7023\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   people warning against the scam  </a> </u> .</p><h3> How to Spot Collection Scammers</h3>It&rsquo;s easy to understand how people could fall for scams like this. Student debt is a source of real anxiety, and even legitimate loan servicers have engaged in some <u> <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-orders-discover-bank-to-pay-18-5-million-for-illegal-student-loan-servicing-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">  shady or even outright illegal </a></u> tactics to collect. What do you do when you can&rsquo;t tell the white hats from the black hats? First of all, remember that even though you may owe money, <u> <a href=\"https://www.credit.com/debt/top-10-debt-collection-rights/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  you still have rights </a></u> under <u> <a href=\"http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb-fair-debt-collection-practices-act.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  federal law </a></u>. Take a deep breath, calm down, and then use these methods:<li> If you are contacted by someone claiming to be a debt collector, ask for the company&rsquo;s name and address, the name of the person calling you (with a callback number) and the original creditor. If they are unwilling to provide this information and a Google search turns up nothing, you can bet that it&rsquo;s a scam.</li><li> If you have a student loan that&rsquo;s outstanding, get your paperwork and call your servicer and check on the status of your account.</li><li> If they threaten you and then offer to &ldquo;help&rdquo; you with your debt for an upfront fee, promising to make it all go away, or are demanding an amount that you could not possibly owe, don&rsquo;t get flustered. Check your credit report. If it&rsquo;s not on your credit report, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</li><li> If you are threatened with legal action, request written notice of the debt to be sent to you via certified mail and that under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you do not wish to be contacted again.</li>Remember, no matter what, you should not pay them any money. Do not send money by PayPal or wire transfer, do not pay by credit card, do not give banking or login information to your student loan account. It&rsquo;s hard to hold your ground and they run their scam this way because it works. Scared people can do impulsive things that can hurt them very badly later. You can even end up with your identity being stolen by someone overseas, and no hope of catching them. If you are ever contacted by these people, the <u> <a href=\"http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/E3EB45228E9229DD85257B05006E32EC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Florida Office of the Attorney General </a></u> should be your next call.If you think you may have been caught by one of these scammers and worry that it&rsquo;s damaging your finances, credit and life, we have you covered. Call <u> <a href=\"http://www.vanhornlawgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  my offices </a></u> and we&rsquo;ll let you know the options available to help you get back to normal.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Kidnapping cases present FBI agents with some of their most challenging investigations. More often than not, the choices that the agent makes has life and death consequences. The goal is always to recover the victim safely and put the kidnapper behind bars. </strong></p><p> Grit is the word that best describes the attitude that takes hold of an agent when they will not allow themselves to consider the possibility of failure. When someone&rsquo;s life is at stake, you keep going&mdash;no matter how dark the path ahead.</p><p> The way in which we look at ourselves, and our circumstances, dictates our attitude when faced with adversity. As entrepreneurs and business owners, you will have several moments where lots of negative thoughts will be occupying your mind.</p><p> To jettison those negative thoughts, you may find it necessary to express your situation differently. When you rethink, or reframe, your adversity, it helps to move it into a context that is more favorable.</p><p> This is not to make light of tragedy. It&rsquo;s perfectly normal to be sad when we are immersed in a negative situation. That said, we do not need to let the crap moments produced by adversity sabotage our efforts to keep moving toward success. </p><h3> 1. Reframe Your Situation</h3><p> <br/> Reframing is a fancy word for changing the way you place limits around your goals and behaviors. If something sucks, the most logical thing in the world is to call it out for what it is. But, when you grit up in the face of adversity, it means you seek out new interpretations and perspectives that will help you keep moving forward.</p><p> Bad news will never keep a dedicated FBI agent from looking for a kidnapping victim. Instead, the agent will reframe the situation so they maintain a more positive and resourceful state of mind. </p><p> Reframing is not about pretending everything is perfect and positive! Instead, it&rsquo;s about providing you with different ways of interpreting your less than perfect situation so you can expand your possibilities. </p><h3> 2. Reframe The Content</h3><p> <br/> If you reframe the content of your situation, it means you choose what you focus on. Nothing has changed, but instead of wallowing in what did not work, you intentionally choose to focus on what did work.</p><p> For example, instead of spending time complaining to everyone that you&rsquo;ve lost a contract, take the time to analyze why you lost it&mdash;learn from the incident. And then move on. No one wants to keep hearing about it&hellip;</p><p> Ask yourself:</p><li> Why did we lose the contract?</li><li> Could we have done something earlier to head it off? What?</li><li> What can losing this contract teach me about myself? My company?</li><li> Are there any negative behaviors that need to be addressed for the future? <br/>  </li><p> Another example might include a mistake that you made. Ask yourself:</p><li> What is positive about this situation?</li><li> What did I do well?</li><li> What can I learn about myself from this experience?</li><li> How can make this information useful for future behavior? <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Reframe Context</h3><p> <br/> In almost every situation where the interrogation of a kidnapper does not lead to a confession, the interviewing agent always kicks themselves by asking, &ldquo;What should I have done differently? What could I have said that would have made them buckle and confess?&rdquo;</p><p> Perhaps the evidence was overwhelming, and yet the kidnapper did not feel compelled to admit to the kidnapping. It&rsquo;s even worse when the victim has still not been found.</p><p> Almost all behavior is appropriate in some context&mdash;maybe not the one in which you are currently in&mdash;but in another situation, your behavior or decision might be quite acceptable and helpful.</p><p> Just because your performance was not appreciated in this context, it does not mean it might not be appreciated in another time or place. This is important to remember so that you don&rsquo;t come down too hard on yourself when you face adversity and things don&rsquo;t work out the way you anticipated.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take the same example as above: you&rsquo;ve lost a contract so you might ask yourself:</p><li> What different conversations would have been appropriate?</li><li> In what context would my choice of words have been the right one?</li><li> What behavior or words could have saved me in this situation?</li><li> Can I recognize that situation in the future?</li><li> When has my behavior helped me in the past? <br/>  </li><p> When faced with adversity, maybe there is no right or wrong way to handle things. What might work in one situation or context may not work in another. Keep reframing things so you can look at all possibilities.</p><p> Grit is learning how to bounce back, no matter what your situation.</p><p> How have you bounced back from adversity?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Sometimes I get a funny response from people when I ask them what their plans are for retirement. It is on more than one occasion that I have heard folks say something like, &ldquo;Oh, I love my job! I&rsquo;m never going to retire&hellip;I&rsquo;m going to keep working until the day I die.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Well, this kind of an attitude is more a hope than a plan. Remember that hope is not a strategy. Hope is a feeling while a strategy is a plan of action. Everyone, I&rsquo;m sure, would love to imagine themselves effortlessly making boat loads of money in their 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, relaxing at the office as they enjoy working away, skipping to work with a smile on their face.</p><p> But here&rsquo;s why many of the people who say they&rsquo;ll never retire are going to find that things didn&rsquo;t exactly go as they planned.</p><li> You may not have the physical freedom you think you&rsquo;ll have. Before I had my first child, I defiantly told my boss that I only needed two weeks for maternity leave. I was healthy, after all, I had run marathons, I had been a personal trainer for heaven&rsquo;s sake. No matter what anyone said, I was adamant about not missing a beat at work. Well, fast forward to my 36th week of pregnancy when I was sitting there in the exam room and the radiologist told me that my baby was displayed in breach position in her ultrasound. I had to undergo a C-Section. To say that it knocked me off my grind is an understatement&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t lift a jug of milk for a week. The incision didn&rsquo;t heal right. I could barely sit down. It hurt to wear anything but loose fitting clothing. Long story short, when I did return to work after two weeks, the best I could do was to work from home and I was such a raging bundle of hormones that half the time I couldn&rsquo;t even concentrate. <br/>  </li><p> The moral of the story was that as defiant as I was, there are forces of nature that can not be defied. As human beings, we are all fragile and there is no denying that the control we have over our physicality is somewhat limited. If I could have gone back, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so unrealistic to believe that I was physically immortal - and made plans accordingly.  It would have made things alot easier for my family.</p><li> Your employer may have other plans. The harsh reality of life is that business is about money and at the end of the day it&rsquo;s about who gets the most done for the lowest amount of capital investment. You may find it challenging to be on the job market after age 60.</li><li> You may have someone else to take care of. Grandchildren, children, an ailing partner. Life happens and how would you feel if someone in your life needed your care and attention but you couldn&rsquo;t be there because you had no choice but to go to work and earn money instead of being with them.</li><li> Tax rates may be so high it might not be worth it. While nobody can predict the future for sure, most of us feel that tax rates are on the up not the down. Working in years that are not the prime earning years might mean going to work every day only to break even.</li><li> Your grandchildren may not live close to you. Being able to enjoy working forever rests on two key assumptions. One, that you will never want more time with your grandchildren than time will allow. Two, that you&rsquo;ll be able to see your grandchildren freely whenever you are not at work because they live close by. Those two assumptions may hold true, but imagine if they do not and you wind up always wanting more time with them because other than the two weeks a year of vacation time all you get is to Skype and talk on the phone.</li><li> Work may not be the activity of choice anymore. There may come a time over your 40 or 50 year career when you feel differently about getting up and earning the paycheck every day as opposed to doing something different with your time, activities other than spending time with children or grandchildren. Examples include traveling, volunteering, writing a book, taking up a new hobby, or starting a business. <br/>  </li><p> Working forever sounds good, but the truth is that this scenario likens to more of a reverie than a reality. It&rsquo;s never too late to take control of your future. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with working until the bitter end, but consider investing some time in planning out a strategy to fall back on in case your wish doesn&rsquo;t come true.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Sponsored by Fidelity Investments </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An independent broker-dealer nurtures Next-Gen advisors to support Next-Gen investors <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> . This is a case study on how Securities America has taken steps in their business to support their next-gen advisors to meet the needs of next-gen investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Many advisory firms tend to focus on an older and wealthier segment of the market. According to the Fidelity 2014 Executive Forum Poll, <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [2] </a> seven in 10 participating firms said that investors 49 years of age or older, or those with $1 million or more in investable assets, dominate their current client acquisition strategy. </strong> A large number of these baby boomer <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [3] </a> clients, however, are moving from an asset accumulation to an asset distribution stage of their life, which is raising questions about how to replenish this business with Gen X/Y investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help firms explore what these marketplace changes may mean for their businesses, Fidelity spoke to advisors who are taking steps to appeal to this younger audience. This includes initiatives to attract and train younger advisors with similar profiles and preferences who may have an opportunity to establish long-lasting relationships with this segment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecurities America, Inc. (SAI), is an example of a firm that has launched a program to train and mentor advisors under 40 years of age to specifically serve younger clients. This next-gen group currently represents about 20% of the firm&rsquo;s 2,000+ advisor population. Fidelity interviewed Kirk Hulett, <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [4] </a> Executive Vice President of Strategy and Practice Management for SAI, to learn more about the program. Hulett leads a team of business coach consultants who work with SAI&rsquo;s advisors on all aspects of owning and running a business&mdash;from planning to marketing to human resources issues.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>We discovered that there are four main components to the firm&rsquo;s next-gen strategy: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Respond to the needs of Next -Gen advisors <a href=\"/?p=4#_ftn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [5] </a></li>\r\n\t<li>Provide appropriate training</li>\r\n\t<li>Coach and mentor</li>\r\n\t<li>Offer tools to be relevant for next-gen investors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Respond to the Needs of Next-Gen Advisors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;When thinking about the next-gen investor, we believe there are some stereotypes that, generally, are just not true,&rdquo; says Hulett. &ldquo;For example, some say these individuals don&rsquo;t have investable assets, aren&rsquo;t willing to pay for advice, and only want to work with a digital advisor. In reality, there is a lot of business opportunity here, and advisors need to engage this group, especially the children of current clients. In our opinion, one of the best ways to do this is to have people working in a practice who look like these investors.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSAI knew it wanted to nurture younger advisors, and in 2014 formed a next-gen advisory council to gather intelligence on how best to serve this segment&mdash;what development programs, marketing programs, and technology to provide. The council is currently made up of eight under-40 advisors who meet via conference call every quarter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe council suggested that SAI create a special next-gen workshop designed to address issues of interest to younger advisors. Held at the firm&rsquo;s national conference, the workshop included presentations by a number of senior advisors. Topics ranged from how to create a fee-based service model to how these senior advisors describe the value they offer relative to the price they charge. Topics also covered succession planning, providing insights on how younger advisors can prepare to take over a practice when an older advisor retires.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The workshop was so well received, we are now rolling out online forums accessible from our intranet,&rdquo; notes Hulett. &ldquo;People will be able to post questions and get responses from other next-gen advisors, and upload documents, pictures, and examples&mdash; all in a searchable archive. We will also use what has been posted as a form of market research to help us identify areas where we might want to develop additional tools or educational materials.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Provide Appropriate Training</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSAI created an Associate Advisor Training Program specifically aimed at next-gen advisors. Hulett&rsquo;s team mapped out the critical competencies they felt were needed for success, and then designed a curriculum to address each of these skill sets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The information is delivered through 22 video training modules, with a moderator explaining the concepts,&rdquo; explains Hulett. &ldquo;They also contain a coach&rsquo;s corner, where one of our senior team members provides a play-by-play review of what was discussed. Each video has homework to reinforce the lessons. For example, under personal productivity, next-gen advisors try to better manage their time and block off hours for high-priority activities, such as prospecting and education. Under client advice and delivery, they craft and present their value proposition, and make a list of useful information to gather when they meet with clients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;In the end, we want these younger advisors to be purposeful about how they create and run their businesses,&rdquo; says Hulett. &ldquo;They need a plan for where they want to be longer term, the type of client to focus on, and the services to provide. We also emphasize the importance of continually showing their value in very tangible ways, as that&rsquo;s crucial to maintaining client relationships and getting referrals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Coach and Mentor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSAI believes that one way for an associate advisor to move to the top-tier is by shadowing an experienced advisor. So they pair a junior advisor with a senior advisor in a mentoring relationship that complements the training and provides opportunities for wisdom transfer. Every other week for a 12-week period, the senior and junior advisor have a phone call with one of the firm&rsquo;s coaches. The coach&rsquo;s role is to guide the discussion and keep it focused on the core competencies junior advisors need to learn, asking questions and facilitating impromptu role plays along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;We started this approach with four coach-mentor relationships to test things out, and things have gone well,&rdquo; says Hulett. &ldquo;Two of the four junior participants have already taken the initiative to go and visit the senior advisor&mdash;although in-person meetings were never anticipated. One of the visits was to see how the senior advisor conducted client seminars for prospecting and education, and the person came back with a number of ideas to incorporate into his practice. We are now expanding this program and taking it to a broader group.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&raquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/297107136;120431617;w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Continue to Full Article </a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Related Articles </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Keeping It in the Family: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/297107339;120431617;b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Four Ways to Help Build Client Relationships Across Generations </a></li>\r\n\t<li>Winning Younger Investors: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/297107337;120431617;z\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Six Ways to Help Attract Gen-X and Gen-Y Clients </a></li>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<li>[1] Born between 1965 and 1992; also referred to as Gen X/Y.<br />\r\n\t[2] The Fidelity 2014 Executive Forum Poll was conducted from May 4 to 7, 2014.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alanscarlson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Alan S. Carlson  </u> </a></p><p> As neuromarketing continues to increase in popularity, there are still many people who do not fully understand the field and often form misconceptions about neuromarketing. Below are the some of the top misconceptions held by marketers and the average person about neuromarketing:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Neuromarketing is Evil </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many people think neuromarketers might someday find the &ldquo;buy button&rdquo; in the human brain that will cause people to act like zombies and make purchases they don&rsquo;t want to. Upon examining how the brain works, it becomes clear that this is impossible, as the human brain cannot be controlled by an advertising message. Too much goes on inside the brain when making decisions for it to be taken control of in this way.</p><p> The fact is any form of marketing could be used for evil, such as making false claims about a product. It is not exclusive to neuromarketing. And in fact neuromarketing can ultimately be used for the greater good.</p><p> Imagine how we could make advertisements for organizations such as the Salvation Army or the Red Cross convince more people to volunteer their time for humanities sake.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Neuromarketing will make Focus Groups and Surveys Unnecessary </strong></h3><p> <br/> Conducting a thorough neuromarketing analysis is more costly (for now) and can&rsquo;t get many things the survey and focus group can. The cost of using an fMRI and EEG machine can be great, considering they can mostly be found in medical centers and require someone with an advanced degree to use. While there are less expensive and less complicated neuromarketing techniques, surveys still provide good insights at significantly lower costs. So we definitely won&rsquo;t be replacing the standard ways of conducting market research anytime soon.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Neuromarketing can cause your nonconscious mind to control your conscious mind. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It has been confirmed in hundreds of studies that this is not true. The fact is the very opposite is true. Your conscious mind always has the power to take control of your nonconscious mind. In scientific experiments, when test subjects are made aware of nonconscious techniques being used on them in order to persuade them, the effects instantly go away.</p>",

    "link": "financial-planning-is-still-trying-to-become-a-profession",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a client or potential client, you may regard fee-only financial planners as professionals on a par with attorneys or CPA's. <strong>  Yet financial planning is still trying to become a profession. </strong></p><p> Several hallmarks distinguish a profession: prolonged or special training, a particular skill, a high level of education, and a formal qualification. By definition, professions are inherently separate from trades, industries, and businesses.</p><p> The financial services industry, where financial planning currently resides, includes a broad spectrum of companies and individuals who sell a variety of products, provide various services, and offer financial advice. Many planners feel that financial planning, as it relates to giving financial advice, needs to be elevated to a profession. Academia has also begun to offer undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees in financial planning.</p><p> Professions such as medicine, law, and counseling require certifications from licensing boards before anyone can begin practicing. There is no such requirement for financial planners.</p><h3> <strong>  The closest thing is a certification which is something less than a formal qualification. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It is a formal procedure by which an authorized organization assesses and verifies the qualification of an individual&rsquo;s skills in accordance with established requirements or standards. Of several certifications for financial planning, the most recognized is the Certified Financial Planner (CFP&reg;) designation from Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc.</p><p> As professional organizations grow and mature, they often tighten the requirements for membership and certification. This has been the case with major professions such as law, medicine, engineering, and mental health.</p><p> In contrast, the CFP Board recently reduced four of the qualifications to earn the CFP&reg; certification:</p><li> In 2012 the Board modified its requirement for three years of financial planning experience to include a two-year apprenticeship option.</li><li> In 2014 the comprehensive exam was reduced from two days to one, a move seen by many CFP&reg; practitioners as the first step to make obtaining the certification easier.</li><li> In June 2015 the Board eliminated the requirement for certain applicants to take a designated financial planning course before taking the CFP exam.</li><li> In June 2015 they broadened the definition of \"financial planning experience.\" Required experience previously included teaching financial planning or delivering financial plans to clients. The new definition includes what the CFP Board describes as \"activities and responsibilities reflecting financial planning knowledge and competencies that indirectly support the financial planner and/or the financial planning process.\" <br/>  </li><h3> As financial planner and writer <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kitces.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Kitces  </a> </u> points out, under this definition \"virtually any job in the entire financial services industry will now qualify as financial planning experience, including an employee benefits administrator, a compliance attorney, and even a journalist who simply writes about financial planning topics.\"</h3><p> <br/> The watered-down requirements are hard to comprehend if the CFP Board's intent is for the CFP&reg; certification to be the mark of the financial planning professional. If the goal is to help financial planning develop as a profession, the organization might tend to tighten the educational and experience requirements, not ease them. Instead, it appears that the goal of the CFP Board is to broaden the CFP&reg; as the mark of the financial services industry.</p><p> <strong>  The CFP Board has left it up to financial planners and academia to elevate financial planning to a profession. That will not happen anytime soon. </strong></p><p> Until a formal qualification for financial planners develops, the public would do well to understand that a CFP&reg; certification is only a mark of education. It does not guarantee that someone has financial planning experience, is competent, or has a fiduciary duty to the consumer. Potential clients still need to verify a CFP&reg;'s qualifications the old-fashioned way: by asking a lot of questions. </p>",

    "link": "stop-pitching-the-gatekeeper-and-what-to-do-instead",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> One of the biggest mistakes many inside sales reps make is pitching the gatekeeper.  For some reason they feel compelled to pour their pitch on the first pair of ears they get, and, unfortunately, this usually gets them into trouble. </h3><p> <br/> To start with, the gatekeeper is just that &ndash; someone whose job it is to screen salespeople from getting through to the decision maker.  The worst thing you can do is immediately identify yourself as a salesperson by pitching them in hopes that they&rsquo;ll be so moved by your pitch that they&rsquo;ll want to put you through.  Doesn&rsquo;t happen.  Instead, all you do is trigger their automatic response of, &ldquo;Just email something, and I&rsquo;ll forward it to my bo ss.&rdquo;  Or worse&hellip;</p><p> By identifying yourself as a salesperson, you&rsquo;ll actually be making it easier for the gatekeeper to just blow you off with, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not interested.&rdquo;  Think about it: They take sales calls like yours all day long, and after a while (like two days on the job), they&rsquo;re as sick of getting phone calls as you are of making them.  So leading with your pitch is the last thing you want to do.</p><p> Also, the reason you don&rsquo;t want to pitch the gatekeeper is because they don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;re selling and they usually have zero say in whether to buy from you or not.  Again, they are gatekeepers &ndash; not decision makers.  Pitching them will mean nothing, and all it will do is annoy them and waste your time.</p><p> So, what to do?  Your job, believe it or not, is to get past the gatekeeper with as little interrogation as possible (and with as little pitching as possible), and connect with the decision maker.  That is the person you want to give your brief pitch to&hellip;  So here are a copy of ways to avoid pitching the gatekeeper, and, instead, getting to the decision maker:</p><h3> 1) By now, you&rsquo;ve already read about my &ldquo;Please, please, please&rdquo; technique.  Some of you are already using it and isn&rsquo;t it great?  For those of you who missed it, it&rsquo;s simple.  To avoid 65% (or more) of any screening, simply open your call with:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hi, this is (your name) with (your company), could you please connect me with (DM&rsquo;s name) please?&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s it.  To read the whole technique, simply check out my blog here: <a href=\"http://mrinsidesales.com/insidesalestrainingblog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://mrinsidesales.com/insidesalestrainingblog/ </a></p><h3> 2) If you don&rsquo;t know the name of the person you&rsquo;re looking for, simply say:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Hi, this is (your name) with (your company) and I need a little bit of help please.&rdquo;</p><p> After they ask how they can help you, you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for the person who handles X &ndash; who would that be please?&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s it.  No pitching, no pleading to be put through, instead you&rsquo;re simply asking for their help and then directing them to put you through.  If you ask this in a polite way, you&rsquo;ll get through 65% of the time.</p><h3> 3) Now here comes the tricky part: In some cases, the gatekeeper has a little more authority, like an office manager, or executive assistant, etc.  In this case it&rsquo;s O.K. to deliver your opening value statement &ndash; just so they know what it&rsquo;s about &ndash; but then it&rsquo;s highly important to try to get through to the decision maker as soon as possible.  Here are a few ways to do that:</h3><p> <br/> The best way is to quickly qualify for decision maker status.  As soon as you ask if they make the decision on what you&rsquo;re selling, and are told that someone else makes the decision, that is your cue to ask to be put through to the actual DM.  Try:</p><p> &ldquo;Oh, I see, tell you what: If you&rsquo;d put me through to (boss) briefly, I&rsquo;ll explain what this is about and if he (or she) is interested in learning more, I can make an appointment that fits his/her schedule.  I&rsquo;ll be happy to hold on while you connect me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;It sounds like the best thing to do before I send something is to have just a few words with (DM), and that way I can save us both a lot of time depending on their level of interest.  Could you please let (DM) know I&rsquo;m holding please?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Before I bother you with emails and then follow up calls, why don&rsquo;t you put me in touch with your (boss) briefly, and I&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s an interest on his/her side.  If so, I&rsquo;ll take the appropriate action, if not, we&rsquo;ll save us all a lot of time.  Could you let (the boss) know I&rsquo;m holding, please?&rdquo;</p><h3> 4)Sometimes the gatekeeper or office manager will want a little more information on what it is you&rsquo;re offering, and in this case it&rsquo;s O.K. to give them more details, but just make sure that you qualify for their role in the decision process and that you ask for the best way to connect with the other decisions makers if possible.  Sample questions include:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;And beside yourself, who makes the decision on this?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer with:</p><p> &ldquo;Great, can I connect briefly with them to make sure this is something they&rsquo;d like to know more about?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;If this is something you like, how much influence do you have in the decision process?&rdquo;</p><p> If they tell you their boss would make the final decision, then layer with:</p><p> &ldquo;I understand completely.  Tell you what, so we don&rsquo;t waste your time or his/hers, let me have a brief word with them, and I&rsquo;ll see if this is something they even want to learn more about.  I&rsquo;ll be happy to hold on&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re then told they aren&rsquo;t available, try to get their name or direct email address or extension, and when you call back if the assistant isn&rsquo;t available, ask for the DM directly.</p><p> <strong>  The major lesson here is that you must resist the temptation to pitch the gatekeeper, or to give too much of your pitch to the assistant if they aren&rsquo;t the final DM.  </strong> Give just enough to qualify for interest, and then try to get through to the actual DM.  This will save you a lot of time and headache later on.</p><p>  </p>",

I am reminded of it as I watch politicians lobby for a vote. I watch, I listen, and I do a gut check: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Can I trust you? </strong></p><p> I think about you and me. Our spheres of influence. Our everyday interactions with folks. Colleagues, clients, friends. Our laboratory for everyday leadership.</p><p> <strong>  Can they trust us? </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s assume competence, for a moment. Let&rsquo;s assume we honor our commitments.</p><p> Beyond the 2 c&rsquo;s, it boils down to consistent behaviors that embody our character, doesn&rsquo;t it? Behaviors that unambiguously signal that we can be trusted. These signals are transmitted in nanoseconds. The specific behaviors can be learned. They will, however, always inhibit trust the moment they become rehearsed.</p><p> <strong>  Here are 4 of those signals. I think of them as Everyday Trust Builders. </strong></p><h3> You speak the truth.</h3><p> <br/> You have your own bullshit meter. You keep your own crap in check.  The platitudes. The easy responses. Yeah, they often sound good. And folks can tell when you&rsquo;re on automatic pilot.</p><p> When there are things you can&rsquo;t divulge, you don&rsquo;t pretend to be transparent. You acknowledge that there are things you can&rsquo;t talk about. You stay real even when you have be strategic. That is speaking your truth.</p><h3> You shut up.</h3><p> <br/> You invite conversation. In conversation, you let others talk. You listen to the words they say. To the deeper meaning behind the words. You don&rsquo;t fake-agree. You don&rsquo;t fake-listen. You give evidence that you have listened AND understood. If you don&rsquo;t understand, you ask for clarification. You engage with sincere curiosity.</p><h3> You appreciate.</h3><p> <br/> You appreciate folks at every organizational level. The attendant in the parking garage. The receptionist. The new hire. The accountant who is retiring after 30 years of service. The Head of the Board. Your competitor.</p><p> Your appreciation doesn&rsquo;t hide in your thoughts. It is actively expressed. It is expressed not with clich&eacute;s and platitudes. Your every word and action explicitly show that you have noticed, and that your appreciation is sincere.</p><h3> You show up.</h3><p> <br/> That means you show up on time. Show up mentally prepared. Show up with heart and mind intact. Yes, you show up undiminished, as the whole person that you truly are, beyond the confines of your job function.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t remember our Everyday Trust Builders only on a good day. We remember them on a tiring day, on a frustrating day, on the occasional day from hell.</p><h3> Yes, every day.</h3><p> <br/> The more we remember, the sweeter our interactions become.</p><p> The day from hell becomes a sweeter day from hell.</p><p> The shift happens nanosecond by nanosecond.</p><p> We just need to remember.</p><p> Trust follows.</p>",

Customers are your company&rsquo;s assets. </strong> Understanding customers is the key to provide them good service. To deliver your promise, you need know your customers well so that you can anticipate their needs and exceed their expectations.  To become a customer focused company, you need a 360 degree view of a customer. Companies need to use better data analytics to gain a much more complete understanding of the customer behavior- what prompts customers to buy, how they prefer to shop, what factors make them switch from one company to another, what they will buy next and why would they recommend your  company to others.</p><p> <strong>  Data is out everywhere. </strong> Finding the right information at the right time is tough. To achieve this 360 degree view of the customer, organizations need to leverage the Big Data. The 360 Degree customer view model captures and structures all internal customer, transaction and account data. The communications between the customer and organization (via email, service calls, website and paper), customer promotion links, demographics, credit and address validation information and segmentation data are stored here. This 360 degree customer view business framework helps to organize, enhance, manage, analyze and disseminate customer information across all departments. With analytics know-how, these departments can extract relevant information to help foster enhanced customer engagement, increased revenue, and long-term loyalty.</p><p> <strong>  In the corporate world, people are continually on the lookout to grab the customers from their competitors. </strong> In order to retain your existing customers and increase engagement, you require a complete, knowledgeable picture of the customer.

The 360&deg; customer view reduces cost to the companies by providing a single source of clean, integrated customer data. It reduces time to market your new products and services by providing an accurate view of customers&rsquo; buying patterns. It also increases customer satisfaction and deepens relationships.</p><p> <strong>  The 360 degree view gives a consolidated view of the customer across your enterprise. </strong> Harness Big Data to obtain the 360 degree view. Unlock the deep customer behavior and sentiments, search, analyze and explore the data, and use the Big Data to inform, cross-sell, up-sell and prioritize promotions.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> <strong>  Are You Using Bulleted and Numbered Lists Correctly? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Bulleted and numbered lists are everywhere and can be especially useful in business writing. And there are good reasons to use them:</p><li> They break up dense text and make it more readable.</li><li> They allow you to emphasize key words and phrases.</li><li> They help you to clearly describe a process. <br/>  </li><p> In our editing work, we see a fair amount of confusion about how and when to use bullets or numbers, so here&rsquo;s the quick and dirty on what you need to know when you want to use lists.</p><h3> Only Use Bullets or Numbers When You Have Two or More Items</h3><p> <br/> We see the use of one-item lists more than you might think, especially when it comes to detailing a process. But a simple rule is that if you don&rsquo;t have a step 2, you don&rsquo;t need a step 1. (This can be a little tricky if you have sub-steps, but we&rsquo;ll get into process-writing tips in another post.) The same goes for bullets. Now I get that some of you like to use a single bullet point to set information apart from a block of text, and I&rsquo;m willing to bend to that logic in certain circumstances. But in general, if you only have a single bullet item, consider setting it off as a note, like this:</p><p> Note: Avoid using single bullets.</p><h3> Bullets or Numbers?</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m always surprised to learn that a writer doesn&rsquo;t know when to use either bullets or numbers (what, you didn&rsquo;t all go to technical writing school?!). So here are the rules of thumb:</p><h3> Numbered list: order is important.</h3><p> <br/> This is a must when detailing a process or procedure. We see a lot of bulleted lists used when a numbered list is the correct choice. Don&rsquo;t let the order on the page or screen be the only indicator of the order of steps; be clear about it and number the steps in the order they should be completed. <br/> <br/> You can also use numbered lists to rank the importance of the items in the list. For example, you could use a numbered list to rank the goals for a project.</p><h3> Bulleted list: order is not important.</h3><p> <br/> So, for example, you would use bullets to list the benefits of a program or the items that should be included in emergency preparedness kit. If you can completely jumble your list items and the information is still accurate, bullets are the way to go.</p><p> <strong>  Easy, Right? </strong></p><p> Remember:</p><li> Use a list when you have two or more items.</li><li> Use numbers when order is important.</li><li> Use bullets when order is not important. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Happy listing! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Corporate-backed bonds in the tax-exempt municipal bond market have retained their value in recent months compared to similar corporate-backed bonds in the taxable bond market. </strong> Under federal tax statutes, bonds backed by private companies may be issued on a tax-exempt basis for specified purposes, such as pollution control facilities. As a result, some corporations back debt in both the muni and taxable bond markets.</p><p> <strong>  In 2015, the prices of the tax-exempt debt of those corporations have been more stable than the taxable debt. </strong> For example, tax-exempt bonds issued in local governments in Louisiana for facilities owned by Marathon Oil Corporation (Baa1/BBB/BBB+) have fallen by about two cents in the third quarter to about 102 cents on the dollar. In contrast, prices of Marathon&rsquo;s taxable debt have fallen from 96 cents on the dollar to 88.5 cents during the third quarter. While SNWAM does not hold any Marathon Oil debt, we hold both tax-exempt and taxable debt issued for Waste Management Inc. (Baa2/A-/BBB). While the price of Waste Management&rsquo;s tax-exempt and taxable debt have remained stable, the tax-free bonds total return during Q3 was about 50bps higher than the taxable bonds in the 3 year part of the yield curve.</p><p> <strong>  The outperformance of corporate-backed tax-exempt debt relative to corporate-backed taxable debt has been fueled by technical factors. </strong> The supply of corporate backed bonds in the Q3 exceeded $315 billion, a 4.5% increase over Q3 of 2014. Conversely, the issuance of corporate-backed munis for the entire year is still shy of $300 million. On the demand side, taxable bond funds have been bleeding assets in 2015. During the week ending October 7, taxable bond funds had over $6.3 billion of outflows while muni bond funds had inflows of $558 million. In September, taxable bond funds had outflows that reached $16.4 billion while outflows of muni bond funds exceeded inflows by about $750 million.</p>Sources:  Bloomberg, SIFMA, ICI",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Procrastination results from one or a combination of the following: trying to be a perfectionist; a lack of self-discipline; a lack of self-confidence; the inability to fight off distractions; a lack of specific goals (and a commitment to them); and fear. </strong></p><p> How many times do you start the day knowing what you want to do (and should do), but eventually come up with a reason why you just can&rsquo;t get started and so you put it off? You know, you say to yourself things like: &ldquo;the timing is just not right,&rdquo; or &ldquo;let me get these few little (usually less important) things done first.&rdquo;</p><p> Whatever your reason may be, the fact is you are procrastinating. And, that&rsquo;s bad for you, your company, your team and your clients/customers. Left unchecked, procrastination can be a career and/or business killer. Here are 3 useful tips to help you:</p><h3> 1. Stop trying to develop the perfect plan; just start doing.</h3><p> While planning and goal setting are important, over planning and trying to identify every single component or issue you &ldquo;might&rdquo; face can be deadly. In fact, when you do this, you likely will make the task bigger than it really is or needs to be. You end up being in a constant state of &ldquo;getting ready, to get started, to commence, to begin.&rdquo; The solution is simple: just get started!Start with just the first three steps of the task at hand. Then evaluate the results and take the next three steps and so on. Allow yourself to &ldquo;learn as you go.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Do the hardest thing first each day.</h3><p> Dale Carnegie said, &ldquo;Do the hard jobs first. The easy jobs will take care of themselves.&rdquo; This is a key point to understand when fighting the urge to put off taking action. It involves self-discipline and your ability to confront your fears about what needs to be done and what the outcome &ldquo;might&rdquo; be. Whatever the task may be, just get it done and behind you as soon as you can. Imagine the boost you will give to your self-confidence and self-esteem knowing that you &ldquo;got it done!&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Fear: face it and push it aside.</h3><p> Many procrastinate out of fear: the fear of failure; the fear of doing the wrong thing and making a mistake; the fear of looking silly; or the fear of rejection or criticism. These folks have not learned how to take a risk. Risk taking is how you move forward and the fear of taking a risk is like nailing your feet to the floor. You stay in the same place with no movement. When we take a risk, we feel &ldquo;uncomfortable&rdquo;. Many of you have heard me say that to be successful, you must learn to &ldquo;be comfortable being uncomfortable.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how you manage the fear. Nothing is ever as bad as we first think it may be. Evaluate the situation; consider the risk and then act.</p>",

    "title": "10 Tips for Men Going Through Divorce",
    "link": "10-tips-for-men-going-through-divorce",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Divorce is rarely, if ever, easy. The emotional roller coaster that embodies divorce often leaves a person&rsquo;s head spinning, even in the best of circumstances. Close to half the population goes through at least one divorce, if not more. It&rsquo;s a hot topic discussed extensively on blogs, articles, and podcasts.</h3>I think it's fair to say that in the past, much of the information available about divorce has been relegated to women. Fortunately, that tide has turned. The number of articles, blogs, websites, newsletters, and forums for men has increased exponentially with many of these dedicated to men, for men, about men, and written BY men. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. Actually &ndash; it&rsquo;s a great thing!When it comes to divorce, the effects on men are transformational. Aside from a man&rsquo;s career, his relationship with his partner is his most vital relationship. Thus, the loss of this through divorce can often be a traumatic experience. How he interprets and experiences this recent trauma varies. Each man is different. However, what does hold true are feelings of trauma are often exacerbated by feeling inadequate and socially isolated more than he has before in his life. This can occur because by and large, women are often the ones that create and maintain social relationships outside of the marriage and men come to depend on them.With the loss of his most stabilizing relationship ending along with the other social relationships and connections, it is not uncommon for men to quickly throw themselves into new, sexual relationships &ndash; often long before they are ready, emotionally, mentally, and psychologically. They seek comfort and distraction from the incredible pain they feel. On the flip side, many isolate themselves, which only worsens the problems and their feelings of loneliness. Many remain bitter and insecure.Yet, despite the trauma of divorce and the emotional roller coaster everyone rides going through divorce, there are several things you can do to help you manage this very difficult time in your life and truly come out on the other side &ndash; healthier, healed, centered, and feeling good about the next chapter of your life.<h3> Here are a few suggestions on how to get there:</h3><li> <strong>  Take care of yourself. </strong> Don&rsquo;t neglect yourself physically. Get up, shower, and show up. So many men let themselves go and not do the basic things that make them feel better. Don&rsquo;t let this be you.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t tell yourself to &lsquo;man up.&rsquo; </strong> Part of the problem our society has is that we expect men not to feel or to grieve. Give yourself permission to grieve the loss of your marriage and any dreams and hopes you may have had for your future.</li><li> <strong>  Reach out &ndash; even if it feels uncomfortable (and it probably will). </strong> Gone are the days of engaging in unhealthy behaviors that keep you locked in a negative mind set about your divorce. Turning to drinking and drugs and not paying attention to what is going on in front of you prevents you from taking stock of what is happening in your life presently.</li><li> <strong>  First, give yourself time to heal and accept your circumstances. </strong> A big part of your healing process is taking charge of your life despite any hidden hopes of reconciliation.</li><li> <strong>  Learn to ride the roller coaster of emotion. </strong> Identify and understand your triggers, how they make you feel, and, more importantly, the thoughts behind the triggers. Triggers often beget more triggers and soon you may feel that, everywhere you turn, you experience a trigger. This might be the case &ndash; but remember that eventually the triggers will decrease in number. They will one day disappear.</li><li> <strong>  Reach out for support. </strong> Although men are not inclined by and large to do so, this is a critical time. Support is vital to your process of recovery and ability to get through your divorce. Support can come in the form of family, friends, a coach, or an experienced therapist. It creates a space to help you heal, talk about your problems, and find resolutions. Doing this will also help you examine your past and your present in order to find a different &ndash; and better &ndash; future.</li><li> <strong>  Hobbies! Are you interested in a particular hobby? </strong> Did you want to take up a new hobby but didn&rsquo;t while you were married? Now is the time. Take the newfound free time that you have and make use of it. Learn to surf or snowboard. Read more. Build things. The world is your oyster.</li><li> <strong>  Exercise. </strong> I cannot express the importance of this! It will help you mentally, emotionally, physically, and psychologically. It not only gets you into shape (or keeps you in shape), but it keeps your mind off things. It releases endorphins. It&rsquo;s good for you. It also releases those feel good neurotransmitters like Serotonin!</li><li> <strong>  Get in touch with what&rsquo;s important to you. </strong> As you begin your journey through divorce, get to know yourself, who you are, what&rsquo;s important to you, what you like and dislike, what you want your new home to be like, and how you want your life to look like &ndash; even if you are not completely sure at this time. Ground and understand yourself. Recognize the things that are important to you and remember them.</li><li> <strong>  Practice forgiveness. </strong> Not just for yourself but your soon to be ex-spouse. This is no easy feat, but it is necessary to move forward. If not, you will stay stuck in the anger, disappointment, and sadness. Though those were there for a purpose in the beginning, keeping them there will keep you stuck in the past and not allow you to keep pushing on.</li><strong> Stay strong and carry on!</strong>Related links worth checking out:<li> <u>  <a href=\"http://chris.pirillo.com/2010/07/27/50-divorce-tips-for-men/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   50 divorce tips for me  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/askmen/6-indispensable-divorce-tips-on-s_b_5194078.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   6 Indispensable Tips on Surviving Your Divorce  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://goodmenproject.com/arts/a-guys-divorce-survival-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A guy's divorce survival guide  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://fathersworkandfamily.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fathersworkandfamily.com  </a> </u></li>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  There is an increasing rush to provide Robo-offerings from institutions and an increasing amount of angst from advisers wondering how to combat it. </strong></p><h3> The way to combat it is for us &ndash; the advisory side of the business &ndash; to educate consumers.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  WE, the advisers, need to take responsibility for providing financial literacy as it is in our best interests to do so </strong> , and it is the element which will generate demand for advice rather than just product solutions.</p><p> Consumers take greater responsibility for their own well-being when they have the knowledge and confidence to make good decisions.  They tend to become more aspirational as they see plans come to fruition, and they accumulate personal net worth.  With increasing aspirations comes the need for more strategic advice, or more specialist strategies.</p><p> <strong>  WE need to take charge of providing financial literacy because it is a primary driver of generating future advice clients in other words. </strong>  Frankly we can&rsquo;t really rely upon the bureaucrats to do it terribly well from what I have seen over the years. They come into the market far too late, and with far too little.  They also pitch far too much of their effort into the no-man&rsquo;s land where limited literacy and low aspirations interact with simple needs.</p><p> When we think about how or where financial literacy of consumers intersects with their requirements it becomes apparent that there is a place for a variety of business models, including robo-advice.  Those consumers with limited understanding, or just simple needs that can be relatively easily met with an off-the-shelf product solution, are prime candidates for a model that provides convenience, simplicity and low cost.  Robo-advice models will meet most needs here.</p><p> However there are also consumers who need only product solutions at certain points (or for particular problems) in their lives, and have the financial competency to be able to make sound strategic decisions in reasonably complex areas.  The &ldquo;brokerage&rdquo; model is ideal for those consumers as it is a personalised but largely transactional service which tends to deal in locating ideal product suites for complex problems once the consumer has largely identified their own need.</p><p> Of course for those consumers who are competent, though perhaps not confident, and who have reasonably complex financial lives there is a requirement for more strategic advice services, whether they be of a general or specialised nature. The complexity in their lives often leads to the need for plans linking product, taxation, advice, legal structure, and mixing business and personal financial needs.</p><p> The critical element therefore in moving consumers beyond simple low-cost product solutions is empowering them to have a better understanding of their own possibilities, together with a recognition of the types of different advice components that can provide meaningful value.   <strong>  That means educating more consumers. </strong></p><p> The good news for advisers is that with the abundance of low-cost communications mediums in the form of social media, blogging, newsletters and increasingly specialised publication services, we have no significant barriers to producing, publishing and distributing empowering content for the consumers we wish to engage with.   <strong>  The even BETTER news for advisers is that consumers are wanting more education and quality content, so there is a convergence of demand and the supply capability. </strong></p><p> Whether enough advisers take advantage of the convergence remains to be seen, however I am convinced that the ability for advisers to generate future clients from todays increasingly discerning consumers is through taking the lead on providing financial literacy.   <strong>  Delivering quality content that educates and empowers consumers will lift their knowledge levels and decision-making abilities, and more consumers will see the need for more strategic or more specialised advice services. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  6 questions you and your partner should consider before you hit the fork in the road </strong></h3><p> <br/> When partnerships are formed, they are always done with the best interests of clients in mind. And done right, a partnership can &ndash; and should &ndash; also provide the perfect environment for synergy, added capacity and expertise, succession and overall success for the advisors. Yet like with any business, the shared mindset the advisors started out with years ago may not be the same today.</p><p> Nothing stresses a partnership more than reaching a fork in the road and having to make a joint decision. Those inflection points are almost always what bring to light the differences between folks&mdash;not at all unlike a marriage. Two examples come to mind&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  What served us so well yesterday&hellip; </strong></h3><p> <br/> David, an advisor with 15 years under his belt, formed a partnership with Alex, a young, successful advisor with whom he had a good relationship. An alliance born seven years ago &ndash; with the intention of solving for succession and creating an opportunity for Alex to eventually inherit a book of business he was already familiar with &ndash; seemed like the perfect union. And it certainly was: together they built a business that grew exponentially in size and service model. But, as David inched closer to his retirement date, he slowed down, contributed less, and became more vested in the status quo. Alex, on the other hand, wanted to evolve and grow the business further by leveraging social media, speaking engagements, expanding client demographics and the like.</p><p> With plenty of time left on his career clock, Alex was left ruminating over the following:</p><p> &ldquo;Is this partnership that served us so well to this point still valid and right for the business&rsquo; future?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Do I continue to stay the course with someone who no longer wants what I want, yet will most likely provide me with a huge succession opportunity down the road?&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  This isn&rsquo;t working for me anymore&hellip; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Debbie, a 48 year-old advisor, and 53 year-old Ted, encountered a chasm in their partnership when their firm&rsquo;s bureaucratic culture got in the way of how they did business. Despite their relative similarity in age, Debbie felt that the toxic, inefficient environment was at DEFCON 1&mdash;more than enough to make her say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to move on to greener pastures.&rdquo; And while Ted was rattled by the imperfections of the firm&rsquo;s culture, it was not enough to leave the relative comfort of the &ldquo;devil he knows&rdquo;. Together, they considered their future:</p><p> &ldquo;How do we resolve this gap between us?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Do we both stay put, make a move together, or split the partnership and go our separate ways?&rdquo;</p><p> Disparities like these often lead to frustrations&mdash;which left unchecked, can not only break-up a partnership, but also destroy a business in the process. These inexorable frustrations are often the catalyst that propels people to investigate the landscape and in doing so, they find that opportunities exist that could increase growth potential, provide better client support, and ultimately provide them with the business life they want.</p><h3> <strong>  Yet your partner doesn&rsquo;t necessarily agree&hellip;so now what? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Certainly, it&rsquo;s rare that differences such as those illustrated above arise suddenly. The fact of the matter is, very few individuals change their goals or behavior overnight. And most often, such differences arise out of a lack of communication&mdash;both at the onset of the partnership and throughout the tenure of the relationship.</p><p> Just like a marriage, the early years of a partnership reflect the initial values and ideals you shared as a courting couple. Over time, people evolve and life changes&mdash;yet those changes often come with some clues. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s smart to check in with yourself &ndash; and your partner(s) &ndash; from time-to-time in order to assess the following:</p><li> Why did we form the partnership in the first place?</li><li> Are those reasons still valid?</li><li> Do we still share the same vision?</li><li> Do we continue to see the world the same way: that is, from an investment management and client service perspective?</li><li> Is our collective work ethic still complementary?</li><li> And, perhaps most importantly: has our evolution as individuals and professionals stayed in sync? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Move forward&hellip;together or separately? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately, relationships have a way of spinning out of control, leaving individuals sitting on separate sides of a line drawn in the sand. All problems have a solution; the solution, however, may not be perfect for all. For example, if Alex stays the course with David, he may gain the book of business in the end, but may need to come up with another way to build the business of his dreams in the meantime. In Debbie and Ted&rsquo;s case, if they choose to stay where they are, she&rsquo;ll be unhappy; if they leave, Ted will likely be unhappy. In either of these two scenarios, if they part ways, they can each solve for their own issues and stay true to their own goals and values&hellip;but the cost of that is either having to find a new partner or solving for the things your partner handled in a new way.</p><p> Ultimately, it is up to each individual to assess his own needs and define what is best for his future. Then, staying on top of your own goals &ndash; and that of your partner(s) &ndash; and considering what changes, if any, are required to maintain alignment is key to a healthy partnership. At the end of the day, remember that it&rsquo;s easier to prevent a fire than to put one out.</p>",

    "content": "<strong> &ldquo;Fintech. Fintech. Fintech.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s childish I know but, like my eight- year-old practising his swearing, I&rsquo;m just going to get it out there. Simply repeating the word is going to irritate plenty of people. Why? Because it&rsquo;s become the Rorschach test of our times and industry. Here&rsquo;s how.</strong>Right up there next to &ldquo;robo advice&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;Fintech&rdquo; polarises people.In my experience, senior financial services executives react to fintech both rationally and emotionally. It&rsquo;s the second half that&rsquo;s really interesting.<h3> <strong>  The lovers </strong></h3>So, to the lovers &ndash; as exemplified by Rob. He&rsquo;s a senior executive in an unnamed &lsquo;big 5&rsquo; financial services institution. He isn&rsquo;t actually in fintech, he is a keen observer of the sector &shy;&ndash; for good commercial reasons.First, he sees the disruptive plays emerging in Australia and offshore as a serious competitive and strategic threat to his own business. Second, he&rsquo;s curious about the fresh thinking, innovation and potential for disruption inherent in the best emerging financial services technology businesses. A little of that, over here, would be helpful, Rob thinks. Finally, he sees an opportunity to learn to evolve his own business from these players.Mark Zuckerberg didn&rsquo;t invent online social networking, but he sure did make it scale. Rob, while working within the constraints of a behemoth, can see opportunity and threat, and wants to be part of the action: driver, not passenger.<h3> <strong>  The haters </strong></h3>Now to the haters. &ldquo;Haters gon&rsquo; hate&rdquo;, as they say. It&rsquo;s a strong word, hate, and it&rsquo;s hyperbole to say it applies to many. However what I do hear is intelligent, seasoned and normally rational leaders in financial services calling BS on fintech founders, hubs and the broader, albeit emerging, ecosystem.These people (let&rsquo;s call them &ldquo;Fiona&rdquo;) might be in a sales-oriented organisation where personal relationships or deep domain expertise drive long cycles enterprise sales. They think they are undisruptable. (Too big to fail?)They forgot about what LinkedIn did to recruiters and Uber has done to the taxi and hire car industry. The new players didn&rsquo;t kill the traditional model per se but they did kill the ones who didn&rsquo;t get with the technology. And they sure did smash margins.<h3> <strong>  The sceptics </strong></h3>Ok, now to the sceptics. Let&rsquo;s meet John, a.k.a the CEO who told me: &ldquo;Twitter will never matter to my business because we&rsquo;re institutional&rdquo; in 2012. Then said in 2014: &ldquo;Twitter is the best source of news I have. We think it&rsquo;s got great potential for our own communication&rdquo;. John is actually many different people, in many different businesses. But the common thread is this: I&rsquo;m not buying into the buzz purely because it&rsquo;s buzz. And therefore just a flash in the pan.Oh John! Do you remember the &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; about digital??? Because that sure didn&rsquo;t take off &hellip; Not. To John my message now would be as it was about Twitter in 2012: &ldquo;Things are going to happen whether you believe in them or not. So now&rsquo;s the time to make a call on how you&rsquo;re going to deal with it.&rdquo; What is fintech anyway?Which brings us back to the buzz at hand, the mashed up word fintech. It&rsquo;s defined variously, but the version I prefer is this, from a Wharton student:Fin&middot;Tech noun: an economic industry composed of companies that use technology to make financial systems more efficient.And that, dear colleague, is why it&rsquo;s an ink blot test. Because by definition fintech changes the status quo. Which we find exciting. #loversnothatersThe first fintech launch I did was in 1997, when I worked for one of those Big 5. It was bad, very bad. The technology was ghastly, it relied on mobile dial up (don&rsquo;t even start me), and it cost a mind boggling amount of money for something a 10-year-old can now do. I wanted to dig a hole for myself at the media briefing and quietly die. No such luck.Two weeks ago, by contrast, I chaired the Q&amp;A at the <u> <a href=\"https://au.onmarketbookbuilds.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  OnMarket BookBuilds </a></u> media conference where the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, launched the <u> <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/malcolm-turnbull-launches-onmarket-app-to-democratise-capital-raising/story-e6frfmdr-1227560677388\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  world&rsquo;s first mobile application enabling retail investors to buy directly into an IPO or placement </a></u>. It was an extraordinary moment. The leader of our country showing up for financial services industry innovation, a fair go for investors and the &ndash; get this &ndash; disruption or increased efficiency of capital markets.In a few weeks we&rsquo;ll launch another fintech brand with real potential to shift the game for Australians who want financial advice. Without an adviser. Some will call it robo advice (it&rsquo;s not), and many will be really annoyed.The &ldquo;so what&rdquo;? My point is this: hating won&rsquo;t hold back the tide. If we want to evolve our businesses we&rsquo;d better be watching the people who are going to disrupt the entire value chain. So we can evolve, not devolve, or just disappear.Be we fintech founder, avid internal change agent at AMP, CBA, ANZ, nab/MLC or BT/Westpac, or a fund manager serving large super funds, there are lessons aplenty from the fintech sector. Some of those will be what not to do. Some might be about how to disrupt traditional structures, give people better financial futures &hellip; and make a motza while doing so.Lots of senior people in financial services understand this. Our BlueChip <u> <a href=\"/fintech-center\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  fintech map </a></u> has been the single most popular piece of content we&rsquo;ve put out in our firm&rsquo;s history. Based on that, I&rsquo;d say there are more lovers out there than haters. So, as I asked John back in 2012, how are you going to deal with it?",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  Finding a Bank or Financial Planning Firm Who Actively Cares About Their Clients </strong></h3><p> <br/> A few weeks ago, Jack Sun who is a net worth investor, received an unsolicited email from Europa Transactions Bank in Chicago requesting he invest in a high-yield investment opportunity. Apparently, the offer was being extended to all of the prospects and clients in the bank&rsquo;s database who had previously filled out any kind of inquiry form.</p><p> Jack felt quite queasy in his stomach at receiving an unsolicited offer like this from a bank with whom he had no personal relationship. He had received similar emails from other banks before and gradually built up a lot of negative resistance to such approaches.</p><p> He couldn&rsquo;t understand how a bank can make this offer when they hardly know anything about him. Jack&rsquo;s skeptical mind began to wonder whether some of the banks were trying to get an edge on the consumer using faulty diesel-powered systems. After all, in the modern day age of Big Data research it would be reasonable to expect that a bank would at minimum use statistics and some casually built online surveys to roughly paint a persona of the prospect or client.</p><p> Jack reflected that given the recent stock market turbulence and increasing complexity of investing, this might be the time to find the right financial planning relationship.</p><h3> <strong>  The Land Grab by Banks for Owning the Client-Centered Financial Planning Space </strong></h3><p> <br/> While I was hearing Jack&rsquo;s story on the golf course, I felt motivated to tell him that there was a fresh approach to banking and financial planning coming. No longer would banks and financial planning firms be playing the guessing game of what is suitable to offer a client and how to engage them.</p><p> I told him of an emerging trend of established banks out there starting to make a grab for the space of being the leading client-centered brand that put the interests of their clients first. In fact, this is what the regulators globally are requiring and the Obama Administration is pushing with the Fiduciary Standard, although it has not been happily embraced by all, yet. For a few years now, some of the banks had been re-branding themselves as client-centered but had no high-quality scientific process which required active client participation to demonstrate it. Jack became intrigued and asked more about what to look for from a bank who would potentially meet his wealth management needs.</p><p> I explained to Jack that what he should look for was a bank who adopts the approach of &ldquo;understanding people before numbers&rdquo; by discovering who the client is first and then collaboratively building a financial plan and investment policy statement which recognizes his complete financial personality. Jack said he had started to read about the idea of behavioral finance in the newspapers and investing magazines. I said that behavioral finance should be the foundation of the bank&rsquo;s approach to customized communication and to the recommendations they make.</p><p> Ultimately, our conversation ended with me suggesting to Jack that he ask each of the banks and financial advisors he interviews:</p><li> What formalized processes do they have to implement a behavioral finance approach which will help him achieve his goals?</li><li> Further, have the processes they use been built and tested by a reputable and independent supplier of behavioral systems or have they been developed in-house to fulfill &ldquo;tick-the-box&rdquo; requirements? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Key Features of the Ideal Financial Planning System Powered by Behavioral Finance Insights </strong></h3><p> <br/> A few days later, at Jack&rsquo;s request I gave him, in email format, a more specific list of the features that should be present in the financial planning service model to fit within the &ldquo;new behavioral economy&rdquo; age of financial planning:</p><li> <strong>  Clear organizational messaging: </strong>  the &ldquo;why&rdquo; and the &ldquo;mission&rdquo; for delivering a service that helps clients live a quality of life based on who they uniquely are, in harmony and without regret. Put another way, helping every client in a customized way to &ldquo;Live with Meaning.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Completion of an online activity at the banks very first touch point with the client: </strong>  to discover the client&rsquo;s communication style and the desired client service experience using a robust scientifically validated process.</li><li> <strong>  Customized first meeting experience with a relationship manager:  </strong> someone who can naturally create the right environment for the client to share what they need and expect.</li><li> <strong>  Assignment of a wealth management team matched to the behavioral style of the client:  </strong> to deliver a service that matches what the client wants -financial planning, investment management, philanthropy, family business etc.</li><li> <strong>  Completion of an in-depth online activity to comprehensively discover the client&rsquo;s financial personality: </strong>  the starting point &ndash; to reveal their natural instinctive behavioral style. This is not just a standard 5 to 20 question risk profile invented in the marketing department which can be manipulated and rarely tells the truth in down markets. Rather, a robust, scientifically validated process which objectively uncovers the client&rsquo;s broader set of behavioral biases (including risk-taking) that strongly influence their decisions. Also, the financial personality reporting must be provided to the client for transparency with the comparison to the advisor.</li><li> <strong>  Completion of a goal-based questionnaire addressing balance across the key areas of life:  </strong> to prioritize the needs and wants to be factored into the financial plan and investment portfolio design. Ideally, each of the client&rsquo;s specific goals is addressed in the portfolio design.</li><li> <strong>  Real-time behavioral management of every client:  </strong> during periods of market volatility on their unique terms. Use of online tooling to enable the client to monitor on a real-time basis their own &ldquo;Market Mood&rdquo; and patterns of behavior.</li><li> <strong>  Bank compliance processes:  </strong> providing real-time monitoring of the recommendations made to each client with respect to their financial personality, financial capacity, and goals. The client should know that the bank will use exception reporting mechanisms to ensure their advisors keep the solutions offered within acceptable boundaries.</li><li> <strong>  Bi-annual review:  </strong> conducted in person with the client or virtually using video.</li><li> <strong>  An advisory team that serves as the Wealth Mentor of the client: </strong> they need to adopt a coaching approach through asking powerful questions that transform the clients thinking as they go through life transitions. Further, the firm and advisors demonstrate through this approach that the client is at the center of the relationship and not the bank&rsquo;s fees. <br/>  </li><p> Jack called me two weeks later and said that after extensive research and introductory phone calls he found many banks and financial advisors who said they delivered this service but actually did not. However, he was pleasantly surprised to find some leading banks and financial advisors were on this pathway. All of those firms on the right path were those using the  <a href=\"http://financialdna.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Financial DNA </a>  behavioral finance platform developed by DNA Behavior International.</p><p> Jack made the decision to start working with the wealth management division of a large, well-known US bank. He added that his research had revealed large banks and financial advisory firms in Canada, Australia, England and Europe moving this way.</p><p> <strong>  I said to Jack, that as banks and financial advisors realize that relationship building is about customizing the communication with clients and the solutions offered, then they will win. </strong> Those who think relationships are only built on rates of return will fall far behind. Conversely, banks and financial advisors who act as a guide to clients in the financial planning process, rather than dominate them with transactions, will, within the next 3 years, grab significant market share, as well as, reduce the business risks of compliance.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The best way to understand the future of work is to go talk to people outside our comfort zone and become an adventurer pursuing possibilities. </strong> If we continue to have the same conversations with the same people, go to the same conferences with the same people, or read books by the same people, what will happen? Well, much of the same in a nutshell. And today, we have created the same culture, one of sameness. One in which everyone is getting to get together to find out what the heroes have done so we can capture their best practice and then go do the same thing that they did. Won&rsquo;t that guarantee success?</p><p> <strong>  Albert Einstein made us aware that this type of behavior is the definition of insanity. </strong> It&rsquo;s like someone telling us the 17 foods that we shouldn&rsquo;t eat. We may be one of 500 people listening to his talk capturing a photo of these 17 dangerous foods. But then when we sit back and reflect, we realize that the person up on the stage doesn&rsquo;t really know us. They have no idea what our body chemistry is so how could they know what&rsquo;s dangerous to us? The best advice that he could give us is to stop eating mass produced garbage and start eating whole foods. After a recent talk on 21st century leadership at a conference, someone came up to me and told me that while she loved my talk, I covered a lot and she wishes I had provided the five key takeaways at the end. I thanked her and shared with her that as I don&rsquo;t know her, I could not provide her with her five takeaways. I was happy to talk and and learn more about where she was in life.</p><h3> #1 Something remarkable is indeed happening</h3><p> <br/> There is no short cut, magic carpet, best practice or formula for the new world we are entering in this century. The 21st century leaders from around the world that have generously contributed to Our Journey to Business Common Sense: What&rsquo;s New is Old (stay tuned for the upcoming crowd funding campaign for the book launch) continuously share with us that the new economy is human-to-human. The leaders and organizations that get the shift that is happening in our world will thrive. We don&rsquo;t need any more change programs in the 21st century as change is constant. What we desperately need is a mindset change. And here are some of the main areas to think about that are emerging from real live stories of 21st century leaders in the book.</p><h3> #2 &ndash; People are consciously leaving scarcity behind and making way for possibilities </h3><p> <br/> Notions of fear, scarcity and competition no longer serve us. For us to &ldquo;win&rdquo; in the 21st century means that there is enough for everyone. The organizations that get it have let go of the notion of taking market share away from their competitors. They are spending their energy on connecting with people who believe in their products (their customers) and building unlikely and unusual partnerships. Why? Because they can in a world that is open and connected.</p><p> Only 2% of the population knows how to use social media tools to build relationships; the rest are stuck in 20th century branding and are using old advertising models that no longer resonate with many people. Most organizations are so stuck in their social media strategies that they are missing opportunities every day to build their business with the people who care about what they create in the world. So it&rsquo;s time for a massive reboot of our mindsets. We have everything we need. We just need to open our eyes and hearts and see it.</p><h3> #3 &ndash; Whole people are creating holistic solutions</h3><p> <br/> Most of the people are sharing with me that they are doing the work in the world they believe in and at some times, at huge personal costs. I have the honour to talk to people from around the world who care deeply about themselves, their communities, the world and the planet. Every single person has a story of wanting to bring the team back together to do meaningful work. And every story is not about bringing more band-aid solutions but taking on a big issue in their organization or the world and bringing people together around shared purpose. One told me that she not only wants to make a dent in the universe but she wants the universe to make a dent in her.</p><p> People no longer want to be segmented and fragmented into a box or a label. We have spent so much time on organizational structure that the cracks are starting to show. And when we know how to use technologically effectively, we no longer need to talk about it as it is simply an enabler of our life and our work. Technology is not changing the workplace. The fact that it can connect us and allow for open dialogue (where not censored) is making so much more possible in our world.</p><h3> #4 &ndash; Waking up to the human-to-human economy</h3><p> <br/> In a human-to-human economy, it&rsquo;s all about relationships. The biggest currency of the 21st century is trusted relationships and community. The days of sales pitches are coming to an end and the most important question any organization and individual can ask themselves and know the answer as well is who do you trust? And most importantly, who trusts you? In this economy, you need to know what are you creating and who wants it.</p><p> Our collective consciousness is awakening to the fact that consumers have a voice and they will make a point of being heard more and more. Our organizations have antiquated terms like &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; and &ldquo;employee engagement.&rdquo; A new world is emerging that make these terms irrelevant. In business, you will need to know how to simply share your creations (products or services) with the world and connect with the people who could benefit from them. You will need people who believe in what you are creating and that your values match theirs. It will no longer be an issue whether they fit into your culture in the new world of  <a href=\"http://www.itbusiness.ca/blog/lifeworking-in-abundance-in-the-21st-century/55027\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  LIFEworking </a> .</p><h3> #5  &ndash; More people are picking themselves, especially women</h3><p> <br/> There is an excitement amongst 21st century leaders that we are able to incorporate good and people in how we do business. There are conversations emerging around what people will want in exchange of their time. The days of patriarchy are coming to an end as more women will stop buying into the fragmentation that exists today and simply create new spaces for solving problems. That is what the 21st century leader does; she brings people together and does not always have the answer. She doesn&rsquo;t need to be the expert in the front of the room.</p><p> This is the era to pick ourselves and not wait to be picked. The increasing number of women leaving to start their own businesses is an indication of a larger trend and large organizations need to start shifting so more women stay and help them lead in the 21st century. In a world where we pick ourselves, organizations will need to re-evaluate and update most of their legal, human resource and back-end systems as they will quickly stop supporting how business is done.</p><h3> #6 &ndash; Always start with people</h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest wishes people have is that their colleagues stop hoarding information. One of the reasons for the epic failure of Enterprise 2.0 was that we led with the technology instead of the human side of work. We poured millions of dollars into creating change management programs to convince people to go to use online platforms instead of integrating the tools into how we wanted to work. We know that people don&rsquo;t like change and yet we continue to think we can stage old world campaigns to convince them that this new way is better. And too often, the people paying the bills for these massive change management programs don&rsquo;t understand that if they simply integrated these tools themselves, they&rsquo;d all be using them already.</p><p> And imagine a world where people in your organization would have access to the people and information sources to do their work and make the organization successful. What would that look like in your world? Would we still need to manage knowledge?</p><h3> #7 &ndash; It&rsquo;s time to co-create</h3><p> <br/> Collaboration has been so over used that it may have lost some of its meaning. If people in the 21st century wake up in the morning and are able to practice their art in their work, then they are able to create something meaningful. An increasing number of people are realizing they want to grow and are looking for others to come together and create more meaning in the world. This trend is taking place increasingly outside of large organizations where people who would have competed in the past are coming together to work together. It&rsquo;s coming from the contingent workforce, which is a $1.17 trillion economy now, and it&rsquo;s growing.  As we live in an open and connected world, it is time for large organizations to start thinking about unusual and unlikely partners to co-create with or risk missing an amazing opportunity to re-invent their business for the 21st century.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I once sat in an executive meeting where the SVP explained that Bob, a junior level executive who reported to her had &ldquo;gotten away&rdquo; with challenging her boss, the COO&rsquo;s, ideas. She shared, <strong>  &ldquo;When Bob started to challenge him, I was really afraid for his career, but Joe (the COO) actually seemed okay with it.&rdquo; </strong> She laughed as she said how lucky he was that he wasn&rsquo;t fired, and how other people hadn&rsquo;t faired so well in the past. Everyone else laughed along uncomfortably. Bob didn&rsquo;t smile.I&rsquo;m still wondering exactly why she shared that story. I think it was an attempt to portray her boss as more reasonable than his reputation allowed. But quite frankly, this one-off story reinforced that an executive really listening to someone a few levels below was not the norm.We all had a feeling that Bob had been sitting in the &ldquo;ready now&rdquo; box of the performance potential succession planning forever. He was a confident and humble rock star and we all knew it. His tenacity was highly valued with his immediate boss and amongst his peers, but something was holding him back.Maybe his willingness to speak up was part of the issue. I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone in the room left being just a little more cautious of what they said.If you&rsquo;re keeping score, that&rsquo;s not a sign of a listening culture.</p><h3> 11 Signs You Have a Listening Culture</h3>My regular readers may have noticed I&rsquo;m on a bit of a listening culture theme. In addition to how important listening is, there&rsquo;s a pragmatic reason for the deep dive.After a meeting planner read my post, <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/what-happens-when-we-really-listen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  What Happens When We Really Listen </u> ,</a> she invited me to come work with 15 CEOs/CFOs of large manufacturing companies to talk about how to create a listening culture. I&rsquo;m calling it, <a href=\"http://www.americanbusinessmag.com/2016/08/how-to-build-a-listening-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Do You Hear Them Now: How to Build a Listening Culture </u> .</a>  I&rsquo;m headed out to conference this week, so I&rsquo;m inviting you to continue to steep in, and weigh in on, what a listening culture looks and feels like. Ideas:<strong> Sign #1: Imagination abounds:</strong> People at all levels are thinking about the business and sharing ideas.<strong> Sign #2: Ideas trump titles:</strong> A great idea is a great idea, regardless of who thought of it.<strong> Sign #3: Customer feedback is encouraged, not gamed: </strong>Employees at all levels are really listening to what customers are saying, not encouraging them to say what they to hear to improve their scorecard.<strong> Sign #4: Feedback creates change:</strong> Feedback is taken seriously, and often acted upon.<strong> Sign #5: Everyone is asking good questions:</strong> And getting real answers.<strong> Sign #6: No one freaks out when an exec shows up unexpectedly:</strong> MBWA is just that (management by walking around), not <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/when-mbwa-becomes-oh-crap-here-they-come/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> OCHTC (oh crap here they come).</a><strong> Sign #7: Meetings are conversations, not readouts:</strong> Meetings are used to make decisions and build relationships.<strong> Sign #8: No one is shocked by the employee engagement survey results:</strong> Because they&rsquo;ve been listening, they know what&rsquo;s working and are already working on the trouble spots.<strong> Sign #9: Hourly workers have regularly planned time to meet and share ideas about improving the business: </strong>Time &ldquo;off-line&rdquo; improves the business.<strong> Sign #10: Employees feel an obligation to speak up when something feels stupid: </strong>Because they know they&rsquo;ll be heard, they feel and obligation to share.<strong> Sign #11: Personal issues are treated with compassion:</strong> Real listening happens when people open their hearts, set aside their biases, and care.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeanSelling\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Robert Pryor  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://leansellingbook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Lean Selling  </a> </u>  </p><h3> And How Do You Make It Shorter?</h3><p> <br/> Everyone, from salespeople to sales managers and business executives, has the same wish when it comes to sales&mdash;to make the process faster. There is no one answer that everyone agrees with on exactly why it takes so long, which makes providing a solution that&rsquo;ll shorten the cycle for all situations quite a challenge. It also means that most folks involved in sales don&rsquo;t try to figure out a solution, either. Instead, they just shrug it off, accepting that the length of the sales process is what it is and can&rsquo;t be changed.</p><p> There&rsquo;s as many theories for exactly why the sales process takes so long as there are salespeople who deal with it. These include:</p><li> People take a long time to make a decision</li><li> There are lots competing interests for the budget involved</li><li> There are many people involved in making the decision, meaning a lot of selling to a number of different Buyers before actually completing a sale</li><li> There are numerous competitors, which Buyers usually want to check out before making a decision <br/>  </li><p> These are all probably true to some extent, but they don&rsquo;t provide the whole picture.  They&rsquo;re also not painting the issue in a light that makes it possible to find a solution. Instead, these become excuses that let salespeople stick to their routines without looker for a better way.</p><p> If you view the reasons for the lengthy sales process through the lens of Lean Thinking, however, you have a different view of possible reasons why the sales process takes so long:</p><li> The Buyer doesn&rsquo;t know how to make a decision</li><li> The sales process started too soon</li><li> The Buyer didn&rsquo;t actually know what they needed</li><li> The Seller didn&rsquo;t actually know what the Buyer needed</li><li> Significant time was wasted waiting for things to move forward <br/>  </li><p> When you view a lengthy sales process with an eye toward cause and effect, suddenly you start seeing solutions to the problem of where the time actually goes. If you aren&rsquo;t looking at the real root cause for why your sales process in particular is taking a long time, then you won&rsquo;t be able to find a solution to speed it up.</p><p> Ask your sales team how many of these Lean Thinking potential causes noted above might be applicable to your lengthy sales process. Encourage them to provide reasons for the long sales process that identify the causes in an actionable way, not a passive way.</p><p> Once you do that, you can start talking about how you can empower your salespeople to take control over the sales cycle. And make it shorter.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Do words like &ldquo;PLUNGES&rdquo; or &ldquo;PLUMMETS&rdquo; (preceded by &ldquo;the stock market&rdquo;) make you a tad nauseous? </strong> They&rsquo;re supposed to&mdash;along with feelings of fear, panic and dread. The media thrives on stirring emotion. And <strong>  when it comes to our money, we tend to think of our investment balances at their highest point, which becomes our bell weather of success or failure. </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;m here to tell you that it&rsquo;s ok to feel the way you do, but it&rsquo;s NOT ok to act out of emotion over the headlines and stories written to create the very reaction you&rsquo;re experiencing. It&rsquo;s like craving a Twinkie. You know the yearning will pass, but that if you give into it, regret will surely follow.</p><p> <strong>  When the headlines are screaming at you, it&rsquo;s important to remember some foundational ideas:   </strong></p><li> Market volatility is normal. It is the constant pricing and re-pricing of securities based on known information or speculation of the future.</li><li> Your future success is not dependent on where the Dow Jones Industrial Average is right now.</li><li> Ignore the big picture at your peril.</li><li> Focus on what you can control (and not on what you can&rsquo;t).</li><li> Creating and maintaining a rational, well-conceived financial plan that considers all market conditions is a good place to find comfort.</li><li> Regret is a sour feast. Hold your values close, especially when all the news seems to be filled with nothing but rotten stories. <br/>  </li><p> Your ability to frame or reframe your thinking is connected to your willingness to break free of the cycle of news stories, speculation and unabashed sophistry of those trying to remain relevant. Ask yourself: who benefits from roiling markets?</p><p> <strong>  Your behaviors stem from your beliefs and your money mindset. </strong> If you believe the headlines and stories, you are more likely to act irrationally and do harm to your future success. If you are able to put the drama aside as yet another round of normal market re-pricing, then you are more likely to follow a rational plan and get yourself through the turbulence.</p><p> Unless you are a committed contrarian, you might view these times as dark. The contrarian sees nothing but opportunity in lower prices and is an avid buyer. A glitch can occur when you start to believe that you can time the market and wait to buy when the market hits bottom. Of course, we all know intellectually that this is impossible as a strategy.  If you are the person who bought at the very bottom, chances are very good that it was nothing more than dumb luck. It&rsquo;s like the guy who won the lottery saying he KNEW what numbers were going to come up.</p><p> The battle of the brain and emotions continues every day. We experience doubt and fear. We believe we &ldquo;should&rdquo; be able to make the right moves to ensure that we never see a down cycle (we can&rsquo;t). We &ldquo;should&rdquo; be intelligent enough to know when to buy and when to get the heck out of Dodge (we aren&rsquo;t). We can&rsquo;t and we aren&rsquo;t&mdash;and trying to either is like counting sand at the beach.</p><p> Instead, stay focused on the big issues&mdash;like your values, health, family&mdash;and on what you can control. And for goodness sake stop reading, listening and opining over the media&rsquo;s second-by-second account of this latest iteration of markets gyrating up and down. Unless you really enjoy that nauseous roller coaster ride&hellip;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Not everyone wants to be the boss. </strong> Just ask your coworkers. The economic, status and access rewards that accompany positions in top management are not enough to attract every talented, crush-it over achiever. This is especially true for millennial women, ages 18 to 32, entering the workforce during the past decade. Being leader of the pack may be on their bucket list but never checked off. Often what is possible is just a drop in the bucket compared to what is expected to be on the short list, a rising star, or even a future SheEO at a Fortune 500 company.</p><p> The continuous demands of work and family are nothing new to women. With not enough time in the day already, we still manage to locate and tap into reserves for the benefit of our team, our workplace, and even our bosses. The iconic image of Wonder Woman with a dashing red cape is not far off from our superhuman powers and what any woman can get done in the average day. Still, our rise to the top may get derailed from this thing called life, parental and family responsibilities that compete for our attention, leaving very little flexibility to climb the corporate ladder after hours. </p><p> Ultimately the decision to walk away from advancement shows up in the pocketbook as I can attest. Those early years of staying home to raise my kids and help take care of my father and loved ones were some of the best memories of my life. I wouldn&rsquo;t have traded being the Chief Everything Officer for the world. However, it meant being accessible after school, during summer and holiday vacations, and on call for anything. Being the boss was the furthest thing in mind then -- a complete opposite to my career today as CEO of SheCapital.  </p><p> With the rise of female millennials in the workforce, things have not changed all that much. According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent study by Pew Research Center  </a> </u>  on pay gap and women, a whopping 34 percent of the 810 millennials polled state they are not interested in becoming a boss or top manager citing responsibilities of parenthood and family as concerns. Furthermore, approximately four-in-ten women with children have reduced their hours at work in order to care for a child or family member while 13% of mothers have turned down a promotion in order to care for a family member.  <u>  See 5 Statistics Every Woman Must Know </u></p><p> Many women find themselves in this same predicament, however, they need not leave money on the table because of position alone. As a 48 year-old gen x female, Chief Everything Officer, and SheEO, I have come to discover five important strategies to help other female professionals wanting to aspire to future positions of leadership in their careers today:</p><li> <strong>  Keep track of your successes. </strong> Be able to prove both quantitative and qualitative how you affected revenue either by increasing sales or decreasing costs. Document and measure, be able to offer supporting materials such as CRM reports, invoices, spreadsheets, and personal letters, basically anything that supports your position.</li><li> <strong>  Introduce a new initiative. </strong> Try something new, brainstorm new ideas for you and your organization to increase sales, create efficiency, improve customer relations, tap into new market segments, streamline operations, and improve morale and retention. Create a proposal that&rsquo;s detailed and compelling. Show costs, estimates, and budget. Include a list of assumptions and projections. Show how it&rsquo;s going to get done from conception to execution to evaluation.</li><li> <strong>  Pump up the skill set. </strong> Take a relevant class, training, or workshop outside the office. Consider earning additional certifications and degrees and going back to school for your MBA or advanced degree.  <u>  See Baby I'm Worth It - 10 Essential Tips to Pay for Grad Schoool </u>  Collaborate with student colleagues and use your company for academic group projects and challenges in class. Share these projects with coworkers and your boss and bring them back to the office for implementation.</li><li> <strong>  Step up to the plate. </strong> Take the stretch assignment nobody wants to touch. Demonstrate a can-do attitude by volunteering for special projects even if you are not sure how to do it and don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t have the confidence to get it done initially. Become solution-oriented and tap into your networks, resources, and mentors for their support. Ask for help and ideas and find creative ways to reward (free food usually works) your team.  </li><li> <strong>  Negotiate for a raise. </strong> But first, show the company you are being proactive in your own financial well-being, starting with the company sponsored retirement plan at work such as a 401(k). Opt in and start making regular contributions before salary negotiations and definitely take advantage of the employer match if available. Begin to prepare the basis for the negotiation discussion with the items previously mentioned in this post: material evidence of success, new initiatives and ideas for growth, enhanced skills, and a can-do attitude.</li>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/jen-diehl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jen Diehl  </a> </u>  </p><p> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u> , we pride ourselves on being the connecting link between financial services firms and influential financial media outlets. In our current 24-hour news cycle, reporters can pursue various avenues to obtain expert information, so how does one stand out as a go-to source? Phone interviews, while effective and convenient, only give reporters a small glimpse of your personality and scope of expertise.</p><p> Recently, we coordinated a day of media meetings in New York City for client Ted Peters, Chairman and CEO of  <u>  Bluestone Financial Institutions Fund </u>  (pictured above). Jetting from one meeting to the next got me thinking:  Digital connectivity has fueled the nonstop news environment, and reporters need easy-access to sources who can feed the increased content demand. But, what does that mean for traditional, in-person meetings between reporters and their sources? Are media tours any more or less important than they were before the dawn of our digital era?</p><p> Seeing how the producers, anchors, editors and reporters responded to their time with Ted, I can say that they might be more important than ever. Here&rsquo;s how to make the most of a well-planned media tour:</p><p> <strong>  Be ready to turn on the charm during in-person meetings.  </strong></p><p> Reporters schedule numerous phone interviews each week. Coordinating an in-person meeting gives them the opportunity to connect a name with a face. This also allows for more casual conversation, so that reporters can get a broader view of your background by picking your brain about banking, the markets, retirement, etc. This is the time to engage the journalist behind the story-specific Q&amp;A.</p><p> <strong>  Let them know you&rsquo;re in tune with their world and relate to their work.  </strong></p><p> Take these interviews as an opportunity to flex your current events muscles. Are you keeping your eye on an upcoming earnings report, Fed meeting or national headline? Let them know! Additionally, seize this moment to complement recent stories by that reporter that resonated with you.</p><p> While on our media tour, Ted and I had the privilege of meeting with  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimsterngold\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jim Sterngold  </a> </u>  at The Wall Street Journal. Having read The Journal every day throughout his professional career, Ted&rsquo;s eyes glimmered like a kid in a candy store walking through the newsroom. His personal connection made his visit with the media powerhouse all the more memorable and demonstrated to Jim his full understanding of his reporting purpose.</p><p> <strong>  Show the media you can be a resource on reactive issues as well as look-ahead stories.  </strong></p><p> What are you working on at your firm? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to share your recent work with the media, as it demonstrates your value to the industry as a whole. Is your firm changing how it structures portfolios? Are you pushing into a new service area? Being responsive to their story needs, as well as sharing good ideas for future reference, is a natural way to increase your value and versatility as a source.</p><p> <strong>  Ask reporters if you can help with any other stories they have in the works.  </strong></p><p> This simple gesture often goes a long way with the media as it signals your understanding of their work. More importantly, it conveys that you are aware of the overall sense of urgency in financial news and are happy to serve as a resource for future projects.</p><p> Remember, in this digitally-driven media arena, the demand for sources and soundbites is soaring, but the opportunity to stand out remains scarce. Media tours can be effective in breaking through the noise, if you know how to play the game. So, when planning the next phase of your firm&rsquo;s PR and marketing efforts, don&rsquo;t overlook the potential value of in-person media relations.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Think back on a Halloween from your childhood or your children&rsquo;s childhoods. Was there an event or a person who stood out to you that was really different? Halloween is one of those events that colors our lives as children (and again as adults with children) because it&rsquo;s about giving and receiving. </strong></p><p> <strong>  How does Halloween relate to marketing? </strong>   Well, they&rsquo;re both about perception, so here are a couple of stories that will illustrate my point.</p><p> A friend of mine told me that her most memorable Halloween happened when she was four or five years old, and it was because something unusual happened&mdash;not your run-of-the-mill, say &ldquo;Trick or Treat&rdquo; and get handed some candy&mdash;something really magical:</p><p> &ldquo;When I was very small, I remember walking through the neighborhood with my parents, and I was drawn to a display in someone&rsquo;s yard. They had rigged up a huge black cauldron over a set of logs, and a really nifty witch in costume slowly stirred what was in the pot with a long paddle. The cauldron had a layer of mist on the top of it, which cascaded down the sides of the pot as she stirred. She was calling to us in a witch&rsquo;s voice &lsquo;Come taste my brew&hellip; if you dare!&rsquo; I was a little scared, but as we approached, the witch&rsquo;s voice changed to a friendly, warm one, and the lady invited us to come closer to see what she was stirring.</p><p> &ldquo;My head barely reached over the top of the pot, but I could see there was a red liquid beneath the mist, and the witch dipped us each a cup of it. Fruit Punch! Then we were guided over to someone else in costume who popped candy into our bags. But it was the witch and the cauldron I will remember forever. We were expecting to walk to a doorstep and have adults inside open the door and hand out the traditional candy. Instead, we got a magical experience that was totally unexpected. I wish I could go back to that woman&rsquo;s home and thank her for giving something of herself that colored my young world. It was a selfless act that took energy and imagination, and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The marketing lesson we can learn from this is to think about your audience and make every effort to give something exceptional; something magical and unexpected. </strong> Whether it&rsquo;s super-helpful content, or a personal, hand-written note to thank someone for something they did for you, be different! Put on your thinking cap and brainstorm ways to delight your readers, your customers, your employees&mdash;everyone you do business with, by giving them an experience that&rsquo;s much more than what they expect.</p><p> My second Halloween story is one from when my daughters were small. I took my daughters trick or treating when my youngest, Niki, was only two years old. When she saw one kid wearing a &ldquo;scream&rdquo; mask, she was terrified and would not leave my arms for the rest of the night! On the one hand it was sad that she wouldn&rsquo;t approach doors anymore with her four-year-old old sister, but on the other hand, I had her clutching me in my arms for the rest of the night. I was her hero for the evening, which increased the bond between us. Well worth the trade-off!</p><p> Both of these stories illustrate how something unexpected changes our perceptions of everyday things, and how relationships can be affected in the process. So think about that when you&rsquo;re handing out candy this Halloween&mdash;and think about it when you&rsquo;re developing content or communicating or giving customer service. What can you deliver that will be different enough to have special meaning (or comfort) for the recipient and make your customer experience memorable and shareable? <strong>  You never know whose life you&rsquo;re going to impact. </strong></p>",

    "link": "are-you-earning-employee-commitment",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Individual commitment to a group effort &ndash; that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.&rdquo; </strong>  &mdash;Vince Lombardi</p><p> Vince Lombardi nailed it. But, your employees don&rsquo;t owe you their commitment. <strong>  As a leader, it is your responsibility to earn the commitment of those in your organization. </strong> Looking out for your employees and earning their commitment is not only good for them, it&rsquo;s good for you, and it&rsquo;s good for business. <strong>  When employees are committed to you, as a leader, and the organization, they work willingly in the best interest of the whole. </strong> It eliminates the &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only in it for me&rsquo; attitude. Employees are willing to give their &lsquo;all&rsquo; to a leader, a cause, and a vision that they believe in. <strong>  So, how can you earn employee commitment? </strong></p><h3> Relationships</h3><p> <br/> The relationships you build with your employees are going to be key in earning their commitment. <strong>  These relationships cannot be merely superficial; you must develop them on an individual level. </strong> This means not only being interested in them professionally, but also personally. Your relationships have to be real, no faking. Employees will see straight through your fa&ccedil;ade. Be yourself with employees; let them get to know the real, imperfect you. Show them that you are interested in their well-being and personal growth. Meaningful relationships earn commitment, boost productivity, and inspire employees to give 110%.</p><h3> Trust</h3><p> <br/> There will be no commitment from your employees without trust. <strong>  The loyalty you need from your employees requires trust that goes both ways. No games; no tricks. </strong> Your actions and words must be honest and consistent. Show your employees that you have their backs. Create and share key learning moments with them. Be open about your failures and weaknesses. Also, you must provide them with a safe place to fail and learn from their mistakes. Give them control over their own work tasks, showing that you trust and have confidence in their abilities.</p><h3> Communication</h3><p> <br/> Earning commitment from your employees takes a whole lot of open and ongoing communication. <strong>  Communication is a tool for sharing the organization&rsquo;s stories </strong> in a way that brings employees together to be part of something important. Communication allows you to convey how employees&rsquo; work contributes to the overall success of the organization. <strong>  Communication is also a two-way street. </strong> Listen more than you speak. Pay close attention to what is being shared and make sure you are on the same page. Communication helps you to remove the barriers to trust, which helps build the relationships that earn employee commitment.</p><h3> Engagement</h3><p> <br/> People simply work harder and are more committed when they are allowed to use their talents. When your employees are engaged in their work, they are more likely to be motivated, to remain committed to your organization, and to stay focused on achieving shared goals. <strong>  Engaged employees have a sense of purpose and know they are making a difference. </strong> When you engage your employees in their work, you challenge them, bring out the best in them, and offer them the opportunity to grow and develop.</p><h3> Acknowledgement</h3><p> <br/> And finally, <strong>  if you want to earn the commitment of your employees, acknowledge their contributions and value. </strong> Your employees are your greatest resource, don&rsquo;t take them for granted. Show them that they are part of something bigger than themselves, something meaningful and important.</p><h3> Earn Their Commitment</h3><p> <br/> To be successful <strong>  you need every employee to be committed to the group effort. </strong> They do not owe you this commitment; it is yours only when you have earned it. So, build strong relationships, develop mutual trust, cultivate open and honest communication, create an engaging workplace, and acknowledge the value and contributions of every employee. That&rsquo;s how you make it work.</p>",

    "link": "how-to-get-more-leads-out-of-your-network",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;How do I get more leads out of my network?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> That&rsquo;s a question I get asked a lot these days.</p><p> Everyone has lists of contacts. Everyone has past clients. Some of them may need what you offer&mdash;right now! But how do you make the connection in a way that doesn&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re a door-to-door salesman? How do you get someone interested in having a meeting with you? (The quick answer is your answer to the same question: What gets you interested in meeting with someone who offers a product or service that you might need?)</p><p> Addressing this challenge is not as difficult as it may seem. In this newsletter I&rsquo;ve laid out a very straightforward set of principles and strategies that will help you create new leads out of your network.</p><p> First, there are <strong>   four principles </strong>  that should guide you:</p><h3> Four Principles for Working Your Network</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Add value: </strong>  Share valuable ideas that demonstrate your expertise and experience. The perception of value&mdash;a feeling you can help with an important issue&mdash;is the primary driver for prospects to want to engage with you.</p><p> <strong>  2. Understand their agenda:  </strong> Find out what their toughest problems and opportunities are. Then&mdash;and only then&mdash;can you tailor your approach to each person.</p><p> <strong>  3. Evoke curiosity: </strong>  You need to get people to reach towards you and feel drawn to know and understand more about your ideas, points of view, and solutions. If you can make your prospects curious, half the battle is won.</p><p> <strong>  4. Maintain frequent contact. </strong>  You cannot predict the ups and downs of the stock market, and similarly, you can&rsquo;t tell exactly when a potential client will have a need that you can address. Just like you need to be invested in the stockmarket over the long term to benefit, you need to be in front of your network on a regular basis, so that when the dam breaks, you&rsquo;re there to help.</p><p> Next, there are two main strategies you need to follow in order to operationalize these four principles: You need to broadcast your value and also engage in personal outreach. Let&rsquo;s look at each one.</p><h3> Two Main Strategies</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Strategy One:   Broadcast your value to everyone </strong> <br/> You should have regular, short packages of value that go to everyone in your network&mdash;or, certainly, to all your &ldquo;followers.&rdquo; Different people focus on different platforms for distributing this content. I focus much of my efforts on this monthly newsletter and of course my books&mdash;which are now being written more frequently and which include short eBooks as an intermediate format. Others concentrate on a daily or weekly blog, on podcasting, on a YouTube channel, and so on.</p><p> If your content is good and you publicize it, you&rsquo;ll get people to read what you write. If no one is reading your material, then you need to work harder at your ideas and their presentation. Your articles, blogs, white papers, newsletters, and/or videos should showcase your expertise and experience in a way that is helpful to people. They should NOT be constant advertisements for your services.</p><p> <strong>  Strategy Two:   Engage in personal outreach </strong> <br/> This is the more labor-intensive part of your strategy to work your network. You must regularly reach out to individual contacts to stay abreast of their issues and see how you can be helpful. Here&rsquo;s my hierarchy of outreach:</p><li> First, talk to existing clients. They are your best source of new business!</li><li> Second, talk to past clients who know you and like you</li><li> Third, talk to other contacts who are potential buyers and who you&rsquo;ve met at least once.</li><li> Fourth, talk to all other contacts <br/>  </li><p> That&rsquo;s how you should prioritize your personal outreach efforts to existing contacts. You should, absolutely, also be adding new names to your network, but that activity is not our focus right now&mdash;leveraging your current network is what this article is about.</p><p> <strong>  So what do you say? </strong></p><p> What do you say when you email, write, or call your contacts? Well that depends on several factors, including: The strength of your past relationship and how well you really know them; how long it&rsquo;s been since you spoke to them; whether or not they actually know what you do; and so on. You have to use your judgment.</p><p> For example, you could call up an old client that you know well and just say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to catch up with you. I&rsquo;d love to hear how things are going, and also share with you some new things I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; It can be that simple. But if you barely know the person, the message might be more like &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to better understand what you do and what your challenges are, and also I&rsquo;d like to tell you about my work and the kinds of issues I help my clients with.&rdquo; Or, you might decide on a less direct approach and ask if you could interview them for an article you&rsquo;re writing or invite them to attend an event or networking function that you think would benefit them.</p><p> If you already know there&rsquo;s a particular issue or topic they are interested in, then the approach could be slightly different again: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done research on that issue, and would love to share with you what I learned from interviewing 20 major customers in that market.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Always drive towards a face-to-face meeting </strong></p><p> When doing this type of personal outreach, your goal is to get at least a phone call and ideally a face to face meeting. An in-person meeting is much more powerful and creates vastly more personal rapport than a phone call.</p><p> <strong>  Ask for Referrals </strong></p><p> Also&mdash;very importantly&mdash;be sure to focus on getting referrals from your current and past clients. You have to ask for these: &ldquo;As you can imagine, most of my business comes from repeat engagements and word-of-mouth referrals from existing clients&hellip;Would you be willing to&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Your outreach strategy will be slightly different for current clients, past clients and all other contacts. Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p><p> <strong>  Current clients: </strong></p><li> Share value-added observations about their business with recommended solutions</li><li> Invest in a draft proposal to address a problem or opportunity you&rsquo;ve recognized</li><li> Offer to come in and walk them through your latest research, service offerings, trends analysis, and so on <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Past clients: </strong></p><p> These executives know what you do, unlike the next category of relationships. Here are some ideas to re-engage:</p><li> Share new service offerings or products</li><li> Describe interesting, relevant new work you&rsquo;re doing with other clients</li><li> Do an assessment about how your work for them went</li><li> Interview them for a speech or article</li><li> Show them research you&rsquo;ve done</li><li> Offer a free consultation or seminar</li><li> Since you know their issues, bring a specific idea, insight, article, or something to help them think their challenge through</li><li> Ask to touch base to find out what their new priorities are for the coming year</li><li> Make a valuable introduction</li><li> Offer your personal help with something (e.g., they just moved to your city)</li><li> Offer fun&mdash;a meal, a social or sporting event. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Other qualified prospects you&rsquo;ve met or talked to </strong></p><p> These executives may not really know who you are and what you do&mdash;and vice-versa. So your challenges are to learn more about them and to educate them.</p><li> Find out their issues: &ldquo;What are the three most important things you&rsquo;re working on this year?&rdquo; &ldquo;What initiatives are you most personally involved in right now?&rdquo;</li><li> If you know what is important to them, be proactive in showing them how you&rsquo;ve solved their issue with other clients (&ldquo;When we last talked you mentioned your frustration about the lack of teamwork, and how your organizational silos are preventing a unified face to the customer. I would agree it&rsquo;s holding you back, and in my experience it&rsquo;s a common issue. I&rsquo;ve helped other companies solve this problem, and I&rsquo;ve found that there are four key things you need to look at&hellip;I&rsquo;d be happy to meet up and walk you through a teambuilding approach that I&rsquo;ve used quite successfully. Shall we try and get together for coffee in the next few weeks?&rdquo;)</li><li> For an expressed issue, offer to put together a brief outline or proposal for how you&rsquo;d approach it, or to send them a specific article you&rsquo;ve written that addresses it.</li><li> Be explicit about wanting to build a relationship and take the next step: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked a few times, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever described the kind of work I do with my clients and range of services I offer. I&rsquo;ve love to buy you coffee and share some examples of recent client work I&rsquo;ve done with firms in your industry&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> Invite them to an event with current and past clients who can talk about what you do. <br/>  </li><p> You may have some prospects that you&rsquo;d like to meet but don&rsquo;t currently know. As I noted earlier, that&rsquo;s also a very important challenge, which I&rsquo;ll address in a future newsletter.</p><p> You can develop more leads from your network if you approach the job systematically, prioritize your efforts, and keep the four principles in mind: Add value, understand their agenda, evoke their curiosity, and maintain frequent contact.</p><p> The graphic, below, summarizes this overall strategy.</p><p> <strong>  What has worked especially well for you when it comes to getting more leads from your network? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Having a social media presence is more and more important today for a business. The number of consumers who seek information about a company via social media continues to increase and it is almost expected that someone will be there waiting on Twitter or Facebook to answer a question. I believe this stems from the frustration many people feel searching a company&rsquo;s website trying to find a way to contact someone or find information.  On social media, the consumer is back in control.  They know how to find things on your pages and profiles and they are already on these social platforms, so it&rsquo;s just easier. So if your company is going to invest the time setting up shop on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest or any of the other places your consumers are swarming, make sure you don&rsquo;t make these mistakes and miss out on big connections and big business opportunities.</p><h3> <strong>  10 Mistakes To Avoid on Social Media </strong></h3>1. Poor Profile Picture or None At AllA profile picture is like signage on a building.  You need to hang a sign out so people recognize you among the masses.  There are a lot of posts that come flying by on social media, be sure your profile pic is clear, bold, and STOPS TRAFFIC! (see also- <u> Your Face, Your Brand</u>)  If you need to resize a photo or logo, hop over to PicMonkey and use their easy resize tool.<h3> 2. Leaving Vital Information Blank</h3>One of your goals on social media is to be FOUND. Each social media site gives you a spot to load up a description about you or your business.  Adding a couple keywords here is important for people to find you.  There is always a spot for you to add your website link and some social sites allow several links&mdash;use them up.  Cross pollinate. Link from Twitter to your website.  From Facebook to your website, blog and perhaps your Twitter account.  From LinkedIn, add links to your website, your blog, a page on your website that shows more testimonials or clients you work with.  Whatever you do, fill it out completely.  Take the time to craft your bios and areas that hold key information.  It will help your business be more FINDABLE!<h3> 3. Create Accounts &amp; Don&rsquo;t Monitor Comments</h3>This is a BIG no-no!  Imagine attending a networking event and someone approaches you to ask a question about your services or to say they enjoyed the information you shared last week, and you just stood there without acknowledging them or answering their question.  You just turn and walk away.  That is what it feels like when someone takes the time to answer a question you post or ask a question on your blog or social media site and never hears back from you.  You should close the loop on all conversations that take place on your social media sites.  (see also- <u> Always Have the Last Word</u>)<h3> 4. Not Using Great Visuals</h3>One of the hottest trends in social, is visual social.  Take a look at a couple of interesting facts that reinforce this fact.  Facebook bought Instagram.  Twitter allows photos to be loaded directly into the stream and displays them large and in charge.  LinkedIn owns SlideShare and encourages people to add visual presentations into their text-heavy profiles and pages. Pinterest and Instagram rule the social scene right now and of course we consume more and more video every day on YouTube (100 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every MINUTE! That&rsquo;s 16.4 years every DAY! You need to get your expertise uploaded.)Your profile should be a visual wonderland, filled with beautiful images, illustrations, videos, infographics and more.  Do not use corny, old and stale clipart. Take that smartphone out and start capturing the story of your business in photos.  (see also-<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Ginaschreck/visual-social-telling-the-story-of-your-business-in-photos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  SHOW ME A STORY </u>  </a>on Slideshare)  If you are looking for a new smartphone and want one with a phenomenal camera, check out the <u> <a href=\"https://archive.li/zN1ay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nokia Lumina Icon </a></u> that Verizon carries.  With a 20 megapixel camera, it takes INCREDIBLE photos.<h3> 5. Not Being Social</h3>Social media is a platform for your to share what is going on in your business as well as helpful tips and information about your products, services and expertise, but it&rsquo;s also a place to BE SOCIAL!  After crafting the content that is all about YOU, take some time to wander around the platform and see what others are talking about.  If you are connected to the right audience (your target market) you should be interested in what they are saying.  Spend time liking, commenting, and sharing the content that others post.  Show interest in others if you want them to show interest in you.<h3> 6. Sending Out Auto-Response Messages</h3>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on this one.  Sending automated messages to people in a private or direct message to &ldquo;WELCOME&rdquo; them or to &ldquo;THANK THEM&rdquo; for connecting with you is a kin to sending a spam message.  Everyone knows it is automated and that you probably haven&rsquo;t even seen their profile yet or connected back.  My favorite is when people also add a link for a free &ldquo;gift.&rdquo; The link is to one of their eBooks or other promotional item that is on a landing page so they can capture your email as well.  Why not let people get to know you first.  Better yet, why don&rsquo;t you get to know them.  Auto messages, whether sent on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn, smell of spam and they don&rsquo;t make anyone feel welcomed.  Either send a real message to the person telling them you are happy to be connected and that you look forward to learning more about them, or send nothing at all.  No impression is better than a negative impression right off the bat!  (see also-<u> Why Auto DMs On Twitter Say You&rsquo;re a Liar</u>)<h3> 7. Not Being Consistent</h3>Many businesses jump into social marketing with great energy, creating their Facebook page, setting up a Twitter account and loading a few photos on Instagram.  They may have someone in the office that seems to always have spare time and so they assign the task of social marketing to him.  After a few weeks of sporadic posts, there are big lapses in time between posts and before long it becomes abandoned.  The biggest challenge with inconsistent posts on Facebook is the algorithm is set up to reward the pages that not only post regularly, but that get regular engagement on those posts.  The less frequent you post, the less opportunity a person has to like or comment on something and therefore your content is bumped by other, more frequent content. On Twitter , Pinterest, Instagram or Google Plus, the more you are &ldquo;seen&rdquo; on these social media sites, the more your community grows. One tweet a day will not grow a community of followers.  Set specific time aside each day for social marketing activities.<h3> 8. Writing Boring Content</h3>Social content is different from the copy you might find on that old brochure in your supply closet from 1995.  It is also different from the copy on your website.  Too many social media profiles are filled with text-heavy content that no one wants to take the time to read.  Keep in mind, when you send an email that is more than a paragraph and it doesn&rsquo;t include bullets or pictures, people are probably getting the same glazed-eyed look and &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; hitting the delete key.   Think of who your target market is&hellip;.specifically.  Are they men?  Women?  Teens?  What do they like?  What other pages and social media profiles are they active on?  Go check them out.  How is that content written?Social content is more conversational.  It is definitely shorter than typical website copy, and it&rsquo;s usually more FUN!  Even if you don&rsquo;t consider your business to be fun, think of your social media pages and profiles as a little networking cocktail party.  You&rsquo;ve invited potential clients to come.  Don&rsquo;t stand at a podium and start droning on and on about your services.  Walk around and have short conversations.  Ask questions and be LIVELY!  On your social media sites, also think about sharing complimentary content that can add value to the lives of your guests.  If you are a hotel, you can share the concert schedule or the best places around your property to get out and hike while visiting.  If you own a furniture or accessory business, you can share tips on cleaning lamp shades or paint colors that brighten a mood in the home.  If you get to know your audience, you will know what other information they might find interesting and helpful.<h3> 9. Asking Rhetorical Questions or Questions Requiring Big Commitment</h3>I find it amusing when I see a page that has a question like, &ldquo;Is your business in financial ruin? Tell us how that happened.&rdquo; First, I would have to admit publicly that my business was a wreck.  Second, the writer of this crazy post is making an assumption that I was looking for a therapist.  No one is going to take the time to answer that post.   Questions that are complex or that require an essay to answer will usually sit with zero engagement as well.  Strive for questions that require a simple YES or NO answer.  Of course some will opt to write a novel and that is wonderful, but don&rsquo;t require that kind of time commitment.  Another type of post that does very well is the A or B post.  Load two photos or describe two scenarios and ask which they&rsquo;d prefer.<h3> 10. Not measuring progress or results</h3>Like any sales or marketing activity in your business, you have to know what is working, what needs tweaking and what needs to be thrown in the trash.  Use a social dashboard tool like <u> <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hootsuite </a></u> or <u> <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SproutSocial </a></u> to measure click through rates, the types of posts that got the best traction with your audience and even which social media platforms are sending the most traffic to your website.  If your community numbers aren&rsquo;t growing that is telling you something as well.  Your content might need to change to become more interesting to people finding you, or you are not spending enough time being social to draw the right people to your sites.  If your target market includes people in California, but you seem to be getting lots of connections in Brazil, you need look at being more targeted geographically with your posts and people you connect with.  Either that or check to see what language you&rsquo;re posting in.What other mistakes do you see organizations make on social media?",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  \"Unintended consequences\". You have probably heard this term used from time to time when governmental policy, designed to provide a positive outcome, sometimes also creatives an unintended negative outcome. Well, such may be the case for some Medicare Part B enrollees in 2016 if no further governmental action is taken. </strong> <br/> <br/> A little known and rarely used social security payment rule and it's connection to Medicare Part B premium increases has created quite an inequity in the application of Medicare Part B premium increases scheduled for 2016.  Incredibly, Part B Medicare premiums are scheduled to increase by a whopping 52% for an estimated 25% of Medicare Part B recipients while the remaining 75% of recipients will see no increase in their premiums due to a \"Hold Harmless\" provision included in the social security rules and regulations. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The Social Security Administration recently announced that there would be no cost of living adjustment (COLA) for social security payments in 2016. </strong> This was bad news for retirees on social security struggling to keep pace with rising costs, especially as it relates to health care expenses. This is only the third time in the past 40 years that social security had a zero percent increase in COLA. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The COLA provision in social security benefits was designed, among other reasons, to offset any increases in Medicare Part B premiums. </strong> If you are receiving social security your Medicare premiums are deducted directly from your social security check.  However, if there was a zero COLA for social security and Medicare premiums increased, your \"net\" social security check would be reduced. In this instance, in order to protect social security beneficiaries from receiving reduced benefits, the so called \"Hold Harmless\" provision was enacted.  This provision ensured that one's social security \"net benefit\" would not be reduced if there was a Medicare Part B premium increase coupled with no increase in social security COLA. <br/> <br/> <strong>  However, the Hold Harmless Provision ended up protecting only 75% of Medicare enrollees.  The remaining 25% of \"unprotected\" enrollees were not only unprotected but also had to bear the full brunt of these premium increases for ALL Medicare enrollees! </strong> <br/> <br/> The three basic categories of \"unprotected\" enrollees subject to 2016 Medicare Part B premium increases include high income earners (about 5% of Medicare enrollees), \"dual eligibles\" (those on both Medicaid and Medicare) and finally those who, for one reason or another, were receiving 2015 benefits from only Medicare Part B or social security, or from neither program. <br/> <br/> For these three groups, Medicare Part B premiums will increase from $104.90 to $159.30 per month. The exception is for the high income group whose premiums will spike to over $500 per month. The \"dual eligibles\" will essentially not be affected because their premium increases will be passed on to their state Medicaid agencies (who, by the way, are already under significant financial pressure). <br/> <br/> <strong>  Clearly, it is not fair or logical that the 25% of \"unprotected enrollees \" should bear the burden of the full cost of Medicare Part B premium increases applicable to all Medicare enrollees. </strong> The White House and some members of congress are already looking into possible remedies for these \"unintended consequences\" of the \"Hold Harmless\" provision in the social security rules. We can only hope that this issue is resolved before the 2016 Medicare premium spikes take place.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Is your website designed with your ideal customer and prospect in mind?</p><p> User experience (UX) is a complex science that sits at the intersection of technology, marketing, psychology, content and more. Optimizing for usability requires an in-depth understanding of how modern consumers engage with websites, and a big part of that is learning how to avoid the most common user experience mistakes:</p><h3> 1. Lack of True Mobile Optimization</h3><p> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/06/09/5-common-ux-mistakes-to-avoid-on-your-mobile-site/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   experts at UserTesting  </a> </u>  report that a lack of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/why-your-business-needs-a-mobile-friendly-website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mobile-friendly site  </a> </u>  is often the most common UX mistake. However, too few brands are truly designing around how mobile web users interact with technology. Your site needs to be easy to navigate, avoid extraneous zooming requirements and omit long landing page forms in order to fit the unique expectations of modern mobile users.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Making sure phone numbers on your website are &ldquo;touchable&rdquo; on a smartphone (so people can touch-to-call) is extremely important. You also want to consider that text needs to be larger on a phone, and images need to be pared back for a better experience.</p><h3> 2. Failing to Understand the Importance of Content</h3><p> <br/> To be clear, UX isn&rsquo;t just about your website&rsquo;s interface. Avoiding user experience mistakes requires an understanding of prospect and customer priorities as well. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/04/3-common-ux-mistakes-killing-good-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   strategist Jerry Cao  </a> </u> , users put the following order of priority on website aspects:</p><li> Content Structure</li><li> Interactive Design</li><li> Visual Design</li><p> Even the most beautiful videos won&rsquo;t help your prospects if they&rsquo;re not ordered logically. Information flow and availability should always be top priority.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Answering prospect questions early on your website and addressing the information they need up front is much more important that telling them about your company. Always think about providing a next step &mdash; a link to a related page where someone can read more and avoid &ldquo;dead ends.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Poor Conversion Pathways</h3><p> <br/> If your website visitors are performing initial research on your product, they&rsquo;re on a mission.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/stop-designing-pages-start-designing-flows/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   UX specialist Morgan Brown  </a> </u>  recommends considering user &ldquo;flows,&rdquo; or simplifying the steps a user needs to take to convert. Minimize extraneous steps, and make it as easy as possible for first-time visitors to keep in touch.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Use Google Analytics&rsquo; Behavior Flow report to show common pathways through your website, and identify where people are abandoning.</p><h3> 4. Slow-Loading Pages</h3><p> <br/> Your site page load times have a significant impact on your brand&rsquo;s profitability. Every one second of delay in loading time  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   decreases customer satisfaction  </a> </u>  by 16 percent. There are a number of free tools for  <u>  <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-load-time/fploionmjgeclbkemipmkogoaohcdbig?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">   measuring average page load  </a> </u>  time, and a huge array of factors that can affect site speed. For example, your site could be bogged down by your database, embeds, tracking codes or other aspects.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Your content management system and web hosting plan impact your website load time. Improving these two things can improve not only your page load time, but search engine optimization, too, as load time is a ranking factor.</p><h3> 5. Low-Quality Images</h3><p> <br/> Creating unique,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   high-quality visuals  </a> </u>  is a top priority. Investing in a photo shoot or swapping out low-quality pictures on your website can significantly increase your visitors&rsquo; experience. Additionally, marketing researchers have found that photos of actual employees perform  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingexperiments.com/blog/general/stock-images-tested.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   better than stock images  </a> </u> . They&rsquo;re superior at establishing a trust factor, which is critical to convert website visitors into leads.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip:  </strong> You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to hire a professional photographer to get great photos, but put some photos of your office, locations and people on the website to make it your own. We covered  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/photography-for-website-redesign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the topic of website photography in a blog  </a> </u> , too.</p><p> Fascinated by the idea of creating a user-friendly website? There&rsquo;s really more to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/website-design\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   designing a website  </a> </u>  than a bunch of nice-looking visuals. When we design websites, we think of the people that will be using them and what information they will be seeking. We think of the path we want them to take deliberately through the website. We consider what will help them to solidify trust in your organization. Don&rsquo;t you want that type of website, too?

    "content": "<p> Americans donated an estimated $358 billion to charities in 2014, according to <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   National Philanthropic Trust  </a> </u> . Not only is that a 7.1 percent uptick from the previous year, but statistics also show that the largest source of charitable giving came from individuals, as opposed to corporations.</p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s supporting a national organization, local initiative or global relief effort, there are plenty of reasons to give back. And, with the deadline for deducting charitable contributions approaching on Dec. 31, there&rsquo;s no better time like the present.</p><h3> Make a Difference.</h3><p> There are more than 1.5 million non-profit organizations in the U.S., according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics. People give back for multiple reasons&mdash;from being personally affected by a cause or knowing someone affected, sharing values of an organizations, empathizing with beneficiaries or wanting to help their community. Regardless of the stimuli, support can make the world of difference to both the organization and the giver. In fact, there are studies that explore ways in which charitable giving benefits for the giver, creating joy, feelings of empowerment, satisfaction and the like.</p><h3> Anyone Can Do It.</h3><p> Similar to a savings strategy, you don&rsquo;t need to be in a certain income bracket to donate&mdash;any amount can generate benefits for the organization and donor. For instance, millennials have recently been recognized as &lsquo;the giving generation.&rsquo; Simultaneously, this philanthropy-focused demographic is often referred to &lsquo;financially strapped.&rsquo; Regardless of the income level and donated amount, giving money back for a greater good can empower the benefactor and create a rewarding experience, all while making a difference for the beneficiaries.</p><h3> Contribute Now, Pick a Cause Later.</h3><p> Many feel overwhelmed with the vast number of groups needing support. And with busy schedules, people often find it difficult to decide how to spend their money in a charitable way. Enter Donor-Advised Funds (DAF). A DAF enables one to receive an immediate tax deduction the year the irrevocable contribution is made, but does not force the benefactor to make any grants. The flexibility helps people be more systematic and methodical about their giving.</p><h3> Financial Advantage.</h3><p> Outside of the &lsquo;feel-good&rsquo; sentiment, charitable giving can reduce tax liability and put you in a better financial position. And when you create a philanthropic strategy, you may find that you are actually able to donate more than originally expected. In the case of DAF contributions, donors can receive a tax deduction up to 50 percent of adjusted gross income for cash contributions and up to 30 percent of adjusted gross income for appreciated securities. Along with publicly traded securities, DAF holders can also contribute complex assets such as real estate, limited partnership interests, private C- and S-Corp stock, and other privately held assets.</p><h3> More Options.</h3><p> If you are already planning on donating by Dec. 31, consider donating appreciated stock from your investment portfolio in lieu of or in addition cash. Doing so will enable you to not only deduct the amount of the charitable donations, but also avoid tax on unrealized gains on that stock&mdash;a &lsquo;double play&rsquo; of tax benefits.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t already doing so, consider giving back to charity before the year comes to end. And if you are already highly philanthropic, consider creating a strategy around your vision. You just may be surprised at how much more you can donate, all while improving your financial situation.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Does your business have a mechanism for collecting and considering customers&rsquo; insights? A good, old fashioned suggestion box or perhaps something more sophisticated? </strong> What do you do with customer input that comes your way?</p><p> Principle 5 in my latest book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071801251/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071801251&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themichexpe-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading the Starbucks Way  </a> </u> , challenges businesses to both cherish and challenge their legacy. Honoring the past, for instance &ndash; the core competencies that have built your business&rsquo; reputation, has value. But a prudent leader will consider at what point those very strengths that have been instrumental to success might be inadvertently becoming traps that could constrain future growth. To avoid eroding the integrity of something that has been central to their success, businesses sometimes never work to improve their offerings for fear of alienating their customers or causing confusion. The result can be a product, system or methodology that becomes an anchor&hellip;tethering your business to the past while holding you back from the future.</p><p> Starbucks gathers and analyzes feedback from customers about suggested improvements and innovations through its  <u>  MyStarbucksIdea.com </u>  website. While many people have offered their opinions concerning the differences between an invention and an innovation, I have always favored the view that an invention is a new creation and an innovation is a new solution that attracts a customer. In essence, innovation is an applied and marketable phenomenon. It involves taking an invention and/or an existing product or service and improving on it in a way that makes it more valuable to those you serve. What is one of the key ways to do this? Listen to those you serve! Execute your customers&rsquo; innovations for your business.</p><p> MyStarbucksIdea is powered by loyal Starbucks customers who login to submit ideas and &ldquo;vote&rdquo; on ideas submitted by others. The site is then updated to reflect which ideas have been launched, which will be coming soon, which are under review, etc. For example, the long-beloved holiday cups are now available for iced beverages in warmer-weather parts of the United States for the first time, thanks to customer requests. Braille gift cards are now available year around, another customer-submitted idea. After much feedback about the loss of the personal touch in the drive thru, Starbucks&rsquo; next generation of drive thru locations will feature a screen where you can see and better interact with the barista taking your order. This opportunity to make a human connection was proving difficult to pull off with the old metal speaker boxes found in most drive thrus. All of this momentum stemmed from setting up a mechanism for receiving feedback, considering the feasibility of the suggestions, and acting where leadership believed it was strategic to do so. Those who were loyal customers before now have a heightened degree of investment because they literally see themselves now reflected in the brand.</p><p> Traditionally, marketers talk about lifestyle brands as those that connect with customers&rsquo; personal identity. They are brands that &ldquo;promote a lifestyle&rdquo; customers value or to which they aspire. Starbucks is certainly a business that has all the traditional aspects of lifestyle branding, as its leaders have stewarded the brand to authentically project an image of product passion, concern for the human connection, and community values. However, Starbucks leaders have also taken their value proposition up a level to something I refer to as an &ldquo;advanced lifestyle&rdquo; brand. Not only does Starbucks &ldquo;project a lifestyle,&rdquo; but it enters the lifestyle of its customers.  It does this in part by soliciting ways to do and be better from loyal customers and then&hellip;actually does them!  The hazelnut macchiato exists and more whole grains are found in Starbucks food options because customers spoke up.  Change, when it comes from your core audience, can provide a wonderful platform from which to usher in future growth.</p><p> Cherish and challenge your legacy by inviting your customers into the conversation!</p>",

    "title": "Merit and Ownership in Family-Run Businesses",
    "link": "merit-and-ownership-in-family-run-businesses",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As part of our discussion of issues related to the transfer of family-run businesses, let&rsquo;s turn to the issue of merit. We&rsquo;ll look first at how merit plays a role in transferring ownership to a child active in the business as well as the role it plays in how &ldquo;fair&rdquo; the child (or children) not assuming ownership perceives that transfer to be.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s consider two common family business scenarios:</p><p> <strong>  Scenario 1: Ideal and Rare. </strong>  These owners had the foresight to avoid the inherent difficulty in having multiple children, but only one company: they sired but one child. Further, that child is capable, ambitious and wants ownership. Transferring a business to this only child makes sense and isn&rsquo;t that difficult to accomplish.</p><p> <strong>  Scenario 2: Real and Common. </strong> Owners have one business but more than one child. This situation commonly plays out in one of three ways:</p><li> All children are active in the business.  In this case, the predominant issue is determining how multiple children will share the control and ownership of one company.</li><li> One child (or several) are active in the business and one (or several) are not.  How does an owner give the business (or at least the controlling interest) to the active child(ren) provided they merit it, while being fair to everyone else?</li><li> Every child, active or not, gets an equal share of the business as well as all other assets. <br/>  </li><h3> Performance Standards</h3><p> <br/> Performance standards vary from business to business, but, at a minimum, they should:</p><li> Be communicated clearly.</li><li> Be written.</li><li> Be attainable.</li><li> Be tied closely to increasing business value or cash flow.</li><li> Describe exactly attributes and performance expected from any key employee seeking ownership.  Result, if attained, is the parent's security. <br/>  </li><p> These standards control the incremental awards of ownership over a multi-year (typically five- to ten-year) time span. As standards are met, a child earns, and is awarded, ownership via stock bonus, gift or purchase.</p><h3> Merit as Measured by Performance Standards</h3><p> <br/> Whether selling a business to key employees or transferring to it children we generally recommend that successors earn ownership (or, in the case of employees, cash to fund the buyout). Performance standards not only govern a successor&rsquo;s ability to earn ownership, but they also motivate (and reward) management and key employees to increase enterprise value and cash flow over time. If employees meet the owner-set performance standard(s), they receive (generally) a cash bonus. Similarly, if a child meets an owner/parent-set performance standard(s), the child is reward with ownership in the business.</p><p> Performance standards can be designed in many ways to reward children with ownership or to allocate ownership among active children. For example, if one child is president of the company or a division, a performance standard (for the award of a stock bonus, for example) might relate to the company (or division) reaching a revenue or market-share target, cash flow level, industry benchmark or other goal. Each child who achieves the performance standard set for him or her receives an award of ownership.</p><h3> Performance Standards and Business Ownership</h3><p> <br/> Hank Weatherby, a business and Exit Planning attorney in Connecticut, tells the story of the owner who brought his son and daughter into the business when his company was worth about $2.5 million. Due to the son&rsquo;s efforts, the company increased in value to $40 million. The son benefited from his value-building efforts in two ways. First, his annual salary increased to over $1 million. Second, the value of his ownership of the company and the new subsidiary increased in value from about $600,000 to nearly $10 million with over $6 million of it available to him, but totally excluded from his estate for estate tax purposes.</p><p> The owner&rsquo;s daughter worked as the company&rsquo;s accountant at a salary of $125,000 per year. She was not contributing to the increase in the company&rsquo;s value so rather than award her ownership outright or continue to increase her salary, her father gifted her, in trust, a small amount of ownership.</p><p> When we asked Hank about whether the glaring disparity in both salary and ownership had poisoned the sibling or parent/child relationships, Hank was surprised.  \"Bad blood? Not at all.\"  Hank recalls that, \"Early on dad told both kids how he planned to transfer the business and about the performance standards he set. Both knew the rules of the game going in and neither had any complaints.\"</p><p> We devoted an entire article to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/importance-communication-family-business-transfers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   importance of communication in family transfers  </a> </u> , and the case above is great affirmation. Both children had the opportunity to &ldquo;seize the ring.&rdquo; One accepted the challenge (with great results) and the other decided to remain active but less involved in the business, but both were satisfied with the result of their choices. </p><h3> Performance Standards and Cash Flow</h3><p> <br/> If you choose to use performance standards based on cash flow increases or other key performance indicators (such as net revenue), another benefit is that as your child meets the standard, he or she creates additional cash. This cash can be distributed to the parents and used to invest in non-business assets. Consequently, the parents will be able to leave the business sooner, or leave as originally intended, with more money. They can also transfer excess cash to non-business owning children.</p><h3> Performance Standards and Successor Ability</h3><p> <br/> One of the valuable byproducts of performance standards is that a child who meets or exceeds them effectively demonstrates her ability to operate the business successfully. Another is that the business-active child can earn ownership under the same conditions as would a non-child key employee earn a cash award.</p><h3> Performance Standards and All Children's Perception of \"Fair\"</h3><p> <br/> Objective measurements of the business-active child&rsquo;s contribution to the business buttress that child&rsquo;s likely position that his or her parents&rsquo; estate (apportioned by gift or inheritance) should not include his or her business interest (whether owned or promised) because he or she has earned it. Performance standards also take the wind out of the sails of non-business-active children who may demand that offsetting assets be transferred to them in an amount equal to the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; of ownership to the business-active child. When children not involved in the company see that their sibling is only receiving ownership in return for his or her blood, sweat and tears, and understands that mom and dad will give them other (and more liquid) assets through their estates, the potential for family discord diminishes significantly.</p><p> Simply discussing the issue of meriting ownership vs. giving ownership to a child helps clarify goals and aspirations for parent/owners, their business-active children and non-business-active children. Once clarified and communicated, the parent&rsquo;s goals can drive the design of ownership transition, which is, after all, the central aim of Exit Planning.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.smarsh.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Smarsh  </u> </a>  </p><p> While email is still the largest component of electronic communications today, organizations are steadily increasing their use of social media. However, when it comes to compliance and having an effective solution in place for supervising social media communications, a gap still exists.</p><p> Response data from the Smarsh Electronic Communications Compliance Survey Report indicates that, since 2011, organizations have significantly increased the allowed usage of social media channels in regulated industries. LinkedIn has gone from 39% in 2011 to 72% in 2015 (up 33 percentage points, nearly double), Twitter from 14% to 44% (up 30 percentage points, more than tripled) and Facebook from 23% to 34% (up 11 percentage points, but relatively modest growth by comparison). The survey response data also indicates that only 39% of respondents, who allow the use of social media channels, have a solution in place for archiving/supervising the social media content.</p><p> <strong>  COMPLIANCE POSITION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS EVOLVING </strong></p><p> Today, compliance professionals are more open to the use of corporate communication across social networks. While the shift didn&rsquo;t happen overnight, feedback in the Smarsh survey shows that compliance officers are moving away from fearing the potential threat of the use of digital channels. Since the inception of this survey in 2011, compliance officers have been steadily moving from prohibition to permission. Leading firms are instituting policies to govern usage of these channels, enabling usage for business communications, and implementing retention and oversight systems to maintain compliance.</p><p> <strong>  A GAP REMAINS </strong></p><p> In 2011, only 17 percent of firms archived at least one of the three popular channels made up of LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. The next year, this grew to an average of 30 percent and now in 2015 it&rsquo;s at 61 percent. While the growth in policy and enforcement technology with leading firms is trending in the right direction, a compliance gap still remains. The remaining 39 percent of respondents that allow social channels do not have an archiving/supervision solution in place for social media content. A lack of awareness that a solution exists for social media content could be a contributing factor to this situation.</p><p> <strong>  WHAT DO THESE NUMBERS TELL US? </strong></p><p> Smarsh believes that this data highlights three key points:</p><li> The use of social media for business communications is on the rise &mdash; even in regulated industries.</li><li> The adoption of business-oriented social media (LinkedIn and Twitter) is growing MUCH faster than personal focused channels (Facebook).</li><li> Due to not having an archiving/supervision solution in place, a significant amount (39%) of organizations allowing the use of social media in regulated industries are still at risk of being non-compliant. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  HOW SMARSH CLOSES THE GAP </strong></p><p> Customers who deploy The Archiving Platform by Smarsh can mitigate potential compliance risks for all their electronic communications, including: content for social media channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and others.</p><p> The Archiving Platform is a leading cloud-based comprehensive archiving platform supporting a broad range of social media content types plus email, instant and text messages, web and video. Unlike email-centric archiving products, the search-ready social media content retained in The Archiving Platform is stored in proper context and not flattened into a generic email format. This differentiating quality enables the advanced and intuitive supervision/review and search/discovery functionality that leading firms are succeeding with.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Question: I am running out of ideas for sales meetings. Do you have any tips for developing skills? </strong></p><p> Conducting concise skill-building activities at sales meetings (online or face to face) is a terrific way to enhance abilities and share best practices. Consider assigning responsibility to a different salesperson for each meeting. Concentrated segments are key! Focusing on one skill set at a time gives salespeople the opportunity to reflect on and integrate skills into the upcoming week. Then, make sure that you review and coach their experiences at the next meeting.</p><h3> <strong>  Objections Drills </strong></h3><p> <br/> Distribute two index cards to each sales person. Ask them to write a recent objection on the card. Collect the cards and redistribute them. Now, ask the salespersons to write responses to the objections on the back of the cards that they received. Collect the cards again and redistribute. The drill begins with a salesperson stating the objection on one of their cards and calling on a person to answer.</p><p> To conduct this in an online meeting, ask each salesperson to submit an objection and potential answer. Post the objections one at a time and ask for responses or call on individuals. Online formats are terrific for playing games. Put the objections that salespeople submit in a jeopardy or other familiar online game format.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll Add to That! &ndash; This exercise encourages salespeople to share knowledge and best practices while helping develop sales and account strategy. Ask each person to prepare an account analysis or customer profile. If you use a CRM, perhaps you have this information stored. Ask each person to outline a current sales objective, the key players, history and any other pertinent information about the current status of the account. Then, pass the account around the room by asking each salesperson for one idea, suggestion or question to add value for the customer and move the sale forward. Keep going until all ideas are exhausted. </p><p> To conduct this in an online meeting, display the profile forms so all can see and use the same process. Tip &ndash; Make sure that you truncate the form so it is visible to all or send the completed forms to participants in advance to study and make recommendations.</p><h3> <strong>  Technology or Competition Study </strong></h3><p> <br/> Assign a competitor to each salesperson. Ask each to research the competition and prepare a comparison of your advantages and disadvantages to the group. Be sure to provide specific guidelines about what they should report. Ask the group to draw conclusions about how they measure up. The same exercise can be used for technology education. Ask each salesperson to research a new technology and report or demonstrate how they have used the technology to advance sales objectives. You could focus on a specific technology such as LinkedIn, or even cell phones. Or, assign a specific technology to each person.   </p><p> To conduct this in an online meeting - Pass controls to each person and ask them to demonstrate what they have learned.</p><p> Market Penetration &ndash; Ask each salesperson anonymously submit what they would do to increase sales and market penetration if they were given unlimited resources. Compile the master list, distribute and discuss. Prioritize and vote on recommendations as a group. Then, act on the recommendations! </p><p> To conduct this in an online meeting &ndash; Consider using polling features to vote on responses.</p><h3> <strong>  Invite an Expert </strong></h3><p> <br/> This could be someone from another department, or someone from outside of your company. It is highly motivating for salespeople to hear what others are doing to be successful. Be certain that you give clear guidelines to your guest. Consider inviting a top performing salesperson from a sister company or unrelated industry to share successes.</p><p> To conduct this in an online meeting &ndash; Invite a guest to be present via video conferencing. Or, find one of your favorite experts on YouTube and play an excerpt. </p><h3> <strong>  Invite a Customer </strong></h3><p> <br/> Make sure you give the customer a clear understanding of why they have been selected to attend. Ask the customer to explain their business needs, what they like about your services and what they like about the competitive solutions they may opt for. Allow the salespeople to interact and ask questions much as if they were on a sales call. They will learn from the customer and from observing each other.  </p><h3> <strong>  Need more? </strong></h3><p> <br/> For more suggestions or for specific sales meeting agendas,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.getcsc.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contact us  </a> </u> !</p>",

    "title": "Tips for Business Women to Help Fine-Tune Persuasion Skills",
    "link": "tips-for-business-women-to-help-fine-tune-persuasion-skills",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Super Girl has x-ray vision and Wonder Woman has the lasso of truth. What does the woman in business have as a superpower? The art of persuasion. This power, unlike x-ray vision, isn&rsquo;t simply given at birth but learned, honed and sharpened. If you are a woman looking to add to your business success, follow these 7 tips to refine your persuasion powers.</p><h3> <strong>  Use Empathy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many women have the natural attribute of empathy, a valuable tool in perfecting persuasion abilities. Empathy can be used to read the reactions of others and apply that information in a way that appeals to the listeners&rsquo; concerns. Empathy requires gentleness. Instead of pushing others to see a certain point of view, gently reasoning with empathy can be highly effective.</p><h3> <strong>  Use Names Often </strong></h3><p> <br/> A customer or client will react when they hear their own name. Learn the names of your clients as quickly as you can and use those names often when working with them. It will compliment their egos and therefore, build connections. Persuading your clients becomes that much easier since connections already exists.</p><h3> <strong>  Use Reciprocity </strong></h3><p> <br/> We tend to feel obligated to return favors after people do favors for us. Using this principle in business is a foundation for persuasion. Sales, coupons and special promotions are obvious reciprocity tools. Dr. Robert Cialdini, Regents&rsquo; Professor of Psychology and Marketing, Arizona State University and author of the book The Psychology of Persuasion, says &ldquo;The implication is you have to go first. Give something: give information, give free samples, give a positive experience to people and they will want to give you something in return.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Use Images </strong></h3><p> <br/> What we see is often much more important than what we hear. Because of that truth, it is important for business women to be aware of what their clients are seeing. Make a professional first impression. Pictures that tell a story can be used to harness emotional responses. In order to become the best persuader you can be, master the art of creating images through words. Be specific and use language that can make your client &ldquo;see&rdquo; what you want them to see.</p><h3> <strong>  Use Undeniable Truths </strong></h3><p> <br/> Build trust with your client by beginning discussions with an undeniable truth like &ldquo;Asking is the beginning of receiving,&rdquo; or &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe, why would they?&rdquo; By doing this you are offering your client a statement they can agree with, since it is true. You are immediately building trust with them by starting off on a point on which you agree. Undeniable truths lead to further agreements, making persuading your client to your way of thinking easier.</p><h3> <strong>  Use Social Proof </strong></h3><p> <br/> Tom Polanski, EVP, eBrand Media, in an article that published the results of six of Dr. Cialdini&rsquo;s persuasion principles remarked, &ldquo;Many television commercials say &lsquo;If our lines are busy, please call again,&rsquo; instead of saying &ldquo;Operators are standing by.&rdquo; The first response implies that other people like your offer so much that the phone lines are busy, which may persuade others to act similarly.&rdquo;</p><p> When people are unsure about a course of action, they look around for guidance. They want to see what other people are doing or deciding to do. This is a fact of human nature that is fundamental to know and use in persuasion. By using social proof that others have agreed or are agreeing to your approach, you are in effect using peer pressure to guide their decisions. We never fully grow out of peer pressure. Testimonials from satisfied customers show your target audience that people who are similar to them enjoyed your product.</p><h3> <strong>  Use &ldquo;Manifesting the Next Step&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Cohen-First&rsquo;s technique takes your customers out of their own limitations. It persuades them into the next steps, even if there is a barrier.</p><p> In an article titled Women in Business: Being Persuasive in Customer Meetings, Rena Cohen-First wrote, &ldquo;After I complete an informal presentation, I love to ask the million-dollar question, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m curious to know, what do you see as the next step?&rsquo; This is my favorite technique of all! If they cannot answer this question (for any number of reasons or objections), then you can ask the following: &lsquo;I see. Out of curiosity, if that issue (the budget, the personal change, the holidays) were resolved, then what would the next step be?&rsquo; This is what I call manifesting the next step.</p><p> The power of persuasion is a super power when used in business and can propel your career to new heights. Fine-tune your skills and watch as clients and customers say &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; more and more. You don&rsquo;t need a cape or an invisible plane, just a determination to employ persuasion in your practices.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Jason Jacobson</p><p> From collegiate football player to worldwide super star, how The Rock parlayed his core strengths into a successful brand &hellip;.</p><p> <strong>  In the most recent wave of Koski Research&rsquo;s Engagement IQ, The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, scored an astounding 41.2. </strong>   This is the third highest mark of all the celebrities we have measured, trailing only Ellen Degeneres (46.1) and Jimmy Fallon (41.2) and outperforming pop icons Taylor Swift (37.0) and Katy Perry (33.5).  How does a collegiate footballer player turned superstar WWE wrestler turned TV/movie star become one of the most engaging personalities we have tested?  The Rock&rsquo;s famous catch line from his wrestling days is &ldquo;Can you Smell What The Rock is Cookin?&rdquo;  Here&rsquo;s his recipe for brand success.</p><h3> <strong>  A Method to Engagement </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The Rock uniquely combines athleticism, confidence, strength, fierceness, sarcasm, playfulness, and benevolence.  These core elements propelled him to prominence in the wrestling world.  The Rock then strategically extended his brand:</p><li> First into movie roles that embraced his core persona in The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King, and Hercules.</li><li> Then into roles that were more expansive in terms of stretching his personality as part of the Fast and The Furious</li><li> Then, in a huge 2015, he starred as an action hero in San Andreas (14th in gross sales thus far in 2015) <strong>  and now as the lead sports agent in HBO&rsquo;s 5th ranked show, Ballers, which was just renewed for another season. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Brand Extension Lessons </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Stay True to Your Core: Throughout each phase and extension, The Rock brand has stayed true to his core elements.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t Overextend: The Rock has eschewed roles that do not fit with his core elements.</li><li> Be Methodical: For more than a decade, The Rock has evolved his brand carefully and strategically. He has avoided the mistakes that have shortened the careers of many others. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Using Social Media Strategically to Cultivate Relationships </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The Rock deftly uses Twitter (9.41 million followers) and Instagram (29.1 million followers, ranked 17th overall) to engage and build meaningful relationships with his audience.  He generates buzz by constantly posting a mixture of personal and professional pictures and videos, workout routines, and behind the scene shots.  Each post serves to enhance his core brand story through sincerity and authenticity.</p><p> In the end, this all translates in a high Engagement IQ score, reflected by the marks that.</p><li> 78% want to have lunch with him</li><li> 68% want to read an article about him</li><li> 48% would post about him and 47% would like his page on Facebook</li><li> 37% find him thoughtful, a high mark indicating brains as well as brawn</li>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  I keep coming back to   <u>   <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/10/another-example-of-why-banking-is-not-the-same-as-music.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    this chart   </a>  </u>  , as it typifies a lot of my thinking right now: </strong></h3>I mentioned the Uber example of this cycle, which began as a start-up but, as it grew into an upstart, it started to be attacked by the incumbents.  Then the regulators woke up and started to consider the implications of the insurance of drivers, the employment status of the drivers, the safety of the passengers, etc.  Then the upstart becomes the incumbent as the regulator restricts its innovation risks to be more in line with the industry it has attacked.  Eventually there is a new business model that has evolved the regulations thanks to the innovation, and this new business model has a new compliance structure that must also be adhered to.<h3> You could say that we see this in most other cycles of change.   Take music.  It began with Napster which morphed into iTunes and now Spotify but, with each change cycle, a new structure of guidelines is produced that must be adhered to.   The same with film and film downloads and other services.</h3>This is therefore what we see now with digital currencies, Fintech disruptors and crowdfunding lenders.  They begin with an innovation model that is unlicensed and unknown but, as risks become noted, their models have their wings clipped to be more in line with the requirements of the incumbent service providers.A great example is bitcoin.  bitcoin begins life as an innovative libertarian dream of money without government.  It soon encounters issues where losses mount wit Mt.Gox, Bitstamp and even the Bitcoin Foundation, and people call for protection of their bitcoins.  The result is that the regulator steps in and creates a <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/03/crime-as-a-service-pay-as-you-blow-with-bitcoin.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> bitlicense</a>, something that looks like a bank license but is specifically for bitcoins.  Following such regulatory moves, the innovation begins to be institutionalised and is used in a new hybrid form between the incumbents and the innovators. Eventually, the innovation becomes the incumbent and the cycle starts up all over again.This is demonstrated in many other forms.  Let&rsquo;s take Facebook.  When Facebook started it was up against Friendster, Friends Reunited, MySpace and more.  Gradually, over time, Facebook spread its wings and created risks, in terms of privacy, data usage, data sharing, advertising and more.  This has led to regulatory structures that manage the Facebook ecosystem and now Facebook is the incumbent and many new innovators are trying to attack and defeat them.In fact, I could lay another chart over this one, which is the innovator to incumbent cycle. Uber moves from start-up to up-start and so a target for all players to attack and, eventually, becomes an incumbent once their business model is understood, regulated and compliant.  Airbnb moves from start-up to up-start and so a target for all players to attack and, eventually, becomes an incumbent once their business model is understood, regulated and compliant.  Facebook moves from start-up to up-start and so a target for all players to attack and, eventually, becomes an incumbent once their business model is understood, regulated and compliant.  PayPal moves from start-up to up-start and so a target for all players to attack and, eventually, becomes an incumbent once their business model is understood, regulated and compliant.  M-Pesa moves from start-up to up-start and so a target for all players to attack and, eventually, becomes an incumbent once their business model is understood, regulated and compliant.  bitcoin moves from start-up to up-start and so a target for all players to attack and, eventually, becomes an incumbent once their business model is understood, regulated and compliant.<h3> During the third phase of the innovation cycle discussed on Friday, the upstart has been noticed by the incumbents and becomes a target to be attacked.</h3>We saw this with Uber from the taxi firms; with Airbnb, it&rsquo;s the unlicensed sub-letting of properties that hits <u> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-19/airbnb-in-new-york-sharing-startup-fights-for-largest-market#p1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the news </a></u>; and with Facebook, the target was <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook\" target=\"_blank\">  privacy breaches </a></u>.PayPal was targeted by banks for its risk and lack of security (falsely); M-Pesa saw incumbent banks saying they were fraudulent (falsely); whilst bitcoin created its own mess with Mt.Gox.Meanwhile, we are now seeing the target phase for Fintech, as US banks hope to stop the march of Fintech through regulation. In August, the Clearing House produced a <u> white paper</u> that effectively said that the world of Fintech or, as they call them Alternative Payments Providers (APPs), is a Wild West.Banks are subject to extensive regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement scrutiny by their regulators with respect to privacy and data security, APPs, by contrast, are providing their products and services by continuing to rely on the backbone of existing bank payment systems while capitalizing on innovations in communications platforms, thus generally managing to avoid the reach of the traditional financial regulators. Additionally, APPs only face punishment for lax data security practices if they suffer an actual cybersecurity breach that is discovered by the government, because unlike banks, APPs are not subject to regular examinations and enforcement actions by regulators.What is key in this process is that you will always get an attack phase in innovation, where the disruptors become the targets of the incumbents before they become incumbents themselves.  And yes, you guessed it, the Fintech unicorns are becoming incumbents.I realised this when I watched SoFi and Lending Club presenting in a bank conference recently and they said over and over that banks are their partners; that they are serving underserved markets; that their operations were being funded by banks; and that banks are their preferred targets for partnership.Talking with P2P lenders in the UK, they&rsquo;ve had lots of regulatory <u> <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=p2p%20zopa%20call%20regulation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  to&rsquo;s and fro&rsquo;s </a></u> but the key call here is that Zopa wanted regulation.  When the regulations were introduced for P2P Lending by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in April 2014, the upstart made clear that they <u> <a href=\"https://blog.zopa.com/2014/04/11/what-regulation-of-peer-to-peer-lending-means-to-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  wanted regulation </a></u>:&ldquo;Zopa has been lobbying for regulation for a number of years and was a founding member of the trade body P2PFA which has been successful in securing regulation for peer-to-peer lending.&rdquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the same from several other Fintech start-ups, and the reason for the demand for regulation is that it makes the start-up trusted and respectable.  My assertion of people not wanting to deal with untested and unlicensed firms is that, once they are tested and licensed, you can trust them.  That&rsquo;s why Zopa wanted P2P regulation.  As Giles Andrews, CEO of Zopa (and guest of the Financial Services Club as keynote on <u> <a href=\"http://fsclub.net/events-focus.cfm?id=471\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  November 25 </a></u>) <u> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7525998a-50ee-11e2-b287-00144feab49a.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3pDrhgAIa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  states </a></u>: &ldquo;there is still faith that regulated industries are more trustworthy than unregulated industry&rdquo;.As startups become regulated, they are now able to move into the mainstream.  By way of example, Zopa is now partnering with banks like <u> <a href=\"https://blog.zopa.com/2015/05/20/zopa-announces-partnership-with-metro-bank/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Metro Bank </a></u>, and being officially recognised as a Government supported tax-exempt savings vehicle by <u> the Treasury</u>.<h3> Having written that the start-up soon becomes the incumbent, a great question on twitter was asked: &ldquo;so how does the incumbent maintain the innovation culture?&rdquo; The answer is that they can&rsquo;t.</h3>Any start-up will eventually gain momentum and size that means they need structure.  Structure, historically, meant organisation and organisation, historically, meant hierarchy.  That&rsquo;s certainly true of most organisations I&rsquo;ve worked for and particularly true for most banks I&rsquo;ve worked with.  Hierarchical organisation structures were managers manage managers manage workers.  This is required to ensure targets and objectives are met.  After all, it&rsquo;s all about Management By Objectives, or MBOs for short.  We have Key Performance Indicators, KPIs and SMART goals and such like.  Then we talk about empowerment, enrichment, diversity and ethics and all those other good corporate things and that&rsquo;s how we realise we&rsquo;ve become the incumbent.Now the new giants of this world don&rsquo;t talk this way.  GAFA &ndash; Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple &ndash; have two-pizza teams and <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/05/amazons-secret-sauce-customer-obsession.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  customer obsession </a></u>, but they can still fall into the trap of management hierarchy.  Equally, they can be accused of megalomaniac leaders who are hated, corporate cultures that are bullying and structures that are chaotic.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as most of those accusations are made out of jealousy.  The fact is that some companies do rock, and some companies can still be innovative even when they have 1,000&rsquo;s of people.So what&rsquo;s the difference between a company that rocks and one that stagnates?<h3> <strong>  Leadership. </strong></h3>The fact is that most of the young firms are led by people unconstrained by the disciplines of the past.  When Peter Drucker came up with The Practice of Management in 1954, firms needed structure.  We had just started to move from the Industrial Age to the Office Age, and management was relatively unknown.  We needed performance schedules and maps of management structure in order to absorb 1,000s of people into suits and cubicles.  That was the age of the post-War era, when most banks grew into global powerhouses and, take note, Drucker was a former financial guy.Now, we need agility and speed.  A global powerhouse built upon formal structures of power and operation does not cut the cloth in the digital age.  A hierarchical management structure is slow and unwieldy, and we have known this for a while.  So we try and adapt.  Maybe we create a Matrix Management Structure which, to be honest, is even more unwieldy and slow.  Show me any Matrix Management Organisation and I&rsquo;ll show you a company that cannot make a decision.  In a Matrix structure, all you have is 10 people who can say no and not one that can say yes.  Get out of there!<h3> So what we really need in the age of the internet where speed, agility and innovation are key, is small, decisive groups who can act upon opportunity and move fast.  It&rsquo;s why I like the two pizza idea of Amazon so, just to repeat and focus this dialogue, here&rsquo;s the  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.jasoncrawford.org/two-pizza-teams\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   two pizza team idea  </a> </u> .</h3>Two-pizza teams are so named because they&rsquo;re small: 6 to 10 people; you can feed them with two pizzas. The most important aspect of a 2PT isn&rsquo;t its size, though, but its fitness function. A fitness function is a single key business metric that the senior executive team agrees with the team lead. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of the P&amp;L for a division: a single metric to provide focus and accountability. In some cases, the fitness function is literally a P&amp;L: for instance, the contribution profit from the sales driven through sponsored links minus the cost of those clicks. In other cases, it&rsquo;s something more clever: e.g. metrics related to the efficiency of picking, packing, and sorting.  Once approved, the team is then free to execute relatively autonomously to maximize its fitness function&mdash;to pursue creative strategies and to set its own internal priorities. A handful of engineers, a technical product manager or two, and maybe a designer all report directly to the 2PT lead; there&rsquo;s I need to coordinate even across teams, let alone across divisions, to get something done. This model has helped Amazon stay nimble and innovative even as it has grown.Imagine this idea in banking and it seems completely incongruous.  Banking is all about structure, control and discipline to avoid risk, exposure and sanctions.  A two-pizza team structure where no group is larger than ten people and they all work to a singular specific objective is not going to work.  Or is it?  <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/08/the-finanser-interviews-guga-stocco-head-of-strategy-and-innovation-banco-original-brazil.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Banco Original </a></u> in Brazil reckon they can make it work.  A digital-first bank thinks that the two pizza structure is critical to their operation, so maybe it&rsquo;s not impossible.  I just can&rsquo;t imagine this thinking in many other financial institutions however.",

    "content": "<p> Here&rsquo;s a real dilemma for a wealthy 87 year old woman whose situation is secure but it is causing family conflict.  She needs full-time care, long term.</p><p> Her financial advisor, together with the bank trustee managing her assets, used calculation tools to figure out how to make her assets last for her lifetime.  Somehow they failed to anticipate the actual cost of caring for an elder with physical conditions and illnesses that require 24/7 care.  This is a woman with advanced cardiac disease who had open-heart surgery.  Her daughter, who is a professional, left her self-employment to care for her mother full time. The caregiving daughter wants some compensation from mom&rsquo;s millions. She indeed deserves it.</p><p> The life expectancy the trustee and advisor chose as a basis for determining how long her assets would need to last was 100 years of age.  Given her medical issues, no doctor treating her would agree with that estimate.</p><p> While cash is being drawn down monthly for her essential expenses for care at her daughter&rsquo;s home, no one calculated the cost to her daughter who is losing a six-figure income by providing the needed care.  Being with her daughter is the mother&rsquo;s preference and her daughter is taking excellent care of her.</p><p> The brother, who is eager to get his &ldquo;share&rdquo; of an inheritance, is hovering around the trustee demanding to know how much is being spent to care for mom and why the caregiving sister should get compensation to make up for her income loss, even partially. He resents his sister for asking for compensation for caregiving.</p><p> <strong>  What could you, as an advisor, do to prevent or mitigate family conflict like this when planning for an aging client&rsquo;s future?   </strong></p><h3> Here are some tips:</h3><p> <br/> 1)  When using tools to calculate life expectancy, take into consideration your client&rsquo;s medical condition. Get real data from your client or from involved family. Update your information and calculations as age takes its toll. Health generally declines in old age.</p><p> 2) Take into consideration that about 70% of people today will need long-term care at some point. In the client&rsquo;s case described above, the minimum cost of care for her is $12,000 a month. That does not include bookkeeping, a driver, or medication management. That figure covers a full-time, 24/7 non-medical home care worker only.</p><p> 3) Assume that if your client has adult children willing to provide care, a wealthy client can and should compensate the caregiving adult child. What is &ldquo;fair&rdquo; should be based on market rates for service provided and the cost of what the adult child has to give up, such as quitting a job.</p><p> Calculation models may be inadequate to build in these details.  The smart advisor will use good sense and knowledge of client&rsquo;s needs and preferences to adjust planned drawdowns to meet those needs.</p>",

If they don&rsquo;t have savings, Potter said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re stressing about how can I afford this.&rdquo;</p><p> Chuck Miller, a Chicago communications consultant in retirement services, said employees mistakenly might feel that the 401(k) is an obvious place to cut back. Health care is an immediate and pressing need, while retirement is in the distant future and easy to put off.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to pay for food, utilities, housing and healthcare &ndash; everything else is extra,&rdquo; </strong> Miller said.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysales4life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Amar Sheth  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.salesforlife.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sales for Life  </u> </a></p><p> When applying for a traditional sales or marketing role in the future, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll hear: </p><p> &ldquo;Congratulations! Welcome to the Revenue Department.&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s right, this entire concept of sales &amp; marketing living in silos will have to blow up one day. My  Spidey Senses  aren&rsquo;t strong enough to predict exactly when this will occur but, through some leading indicators that are fairly evident to those that are observing, it will happen within the next 10 years.</p><h3> The Era of the Customer</h3><p> <br/> The collaborative power of the Internet and social media was something that I&rsquo;m sure none of us could fully understand. But, it has affected the way you, your clients, and virtually all of us make judgements and conduct research in the purchasing decision. </p><p> The results are nothing short of startling in terms of human progression. While a stretch to some, this will change the course of human evolution as well.</p><p> Now you can see why a leader like Prime Minister Modi of India is more popular than One Direction in that country. He&rsquo;s one of the few leaders in the world that has created (and will soon execute on) a full digital transformation strategy on a country-wide basis. His goal is to deliver high-speed internet to over 250 Million Indians in villages. This is ground-breaking as more buyers will finally have access to choice.</p><p> And choice, my friends, is the ultimate goal of capitalism and free-market societies. So it&rsquo;s this entire movement of choice and autonomy that&rsquo;s starting to drive the integration and alignment of sales and marketing departments.</p><h3> One Funnel To Rule Them All</h3><p> <br/> If customers are online, reading, consuming content, collaborating with others and, ultimately, making judgements about you and your brand. Then it&rsquo;s critical that this move towards  <strong>  digital sales </strong>  happens quickly. </p><p> The more this continues, the greater the threat to organizations. By marketing and sales working to align every single facet of the buying journey together and positioning content, offers, product, etc. it increases the sanity of the entire funnel. When both sales and marketing teams are in sync, companies became 67% better at closing deals according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketo.com/ebooks/jumpstart-revenue-growth-with-sales-and-marketing-alignment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketo  </a> </u> .</p><br /><h3> Changes Needed To Allow For This</h3><p> <br/> There are significant changes that are needed for this evolution to occur. While not an exhaustive list, it&rsquo;s crystal clear that these are the bare minimums.</p><p> 1. Sales Leaders must acknowledge that the buying journey is now fully in place over their traditional sales process. I believe, fundamentally, this is the first step needed. In fact, 95% of buyers chose a solution provider that  provided them with ample content to help navigate through each stage of the buying process , according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/stats-that-prove-the-power-of-smarketing-slideshare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DemandGen Report  </a> </u> .</p><br /><p> 2. Sales &amp; Marketing Leaders must develop rich content sources and libraries that are fully aligned to their specific customer buying journey. These repositories must live and breathe online and sales must actively share this information at every stage of the funnel. This can&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; &ndash; it must be ingrained within the sales professional&rsquo;s measured activity cadence. Sales has to work hand-in-hand with marketing. With sales providing insight from clients and marketing creating the digital assets that are relevant to the client&rsquo;s challenges. Without this alignment, 60-70% of B2B content created is  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/stats-that-prove-the-power-of-smarketing-slideshare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never used  </a> </u> . The most cited reason is because the topic is irrelevant to the buyer audience.</p><br /><p> 3. Digital champions, a new role that is beginning to emerge in large organizations, will now operate in complete transparency carrying information throughout the Revenue Department with one very simple and stated goal: get the right information, to the right prospect, at the right time.</p><p> As I said earlier, the  One Funnel Movement  has already begun. Very large, global organizations are already starting to experiment with this concept and it&rsquo;s making significant impact.</p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> As revenue leaders, it&rsquo;s imperative that all obstacles preventing this evolution be removed. However, first you must conduct an audit that helps you identify your resources and what&rsquo;s preventing change. </p><p> In addition, you may need to research the marketplace to see this trend yourself. But believe me, it&rsquo;s happening. </p><p> I fundamentally believe that any organization that&rsquo;s striving to evolve to the digital selling revolution will see tremendous gains. After all, their customers will benefit the most by having complete autonomy in their purchasing decision, while still being able to tap into information whenever needed.</p><p> So, what are your thoughts about this? Does it sound like absolute hogwash to you or are you seeing the sales &amp; marketing alignment take place already?</p>",

    "content": "<p> From the <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People   </u> </a></p><p> Sometimes, when you see a truly amazing person speak or watch a mind-blowing TED talk on YouTube or witness a show-stopping performance, you feel a rush of inspiration run through your body. <strong>  You wonder, &ldquo;How on earth did that person become who they are today?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> You may be the type of person who takes that inspiration and runs with it. Or you may be the type of person who looks on admiringly, assuming you&rsquo;ll never be like that.</p><h3> But what if you could be that great? What if there was a formula to create greatness . . . in anyone?</h3><p>  </p><p> That is the question Lewis Howes has asked himself for most of his life. As a kid he was the rejected, awkward student who struggled in school and had no friends. But once he discovered his passion and talent for sports, he began to channel all of his energy and frustration into athletics.</p><p> That led to many achievements in football and the decathlon (including breaking a world record), but it wasn&rsquo;t enough for him. He still wanted to be great.</p><p> After a career-ending injury, he found himself recovering on his sister&rsquo;s couch, broke and clueless about what to do next. But he again channeled his frustration and energy into learning new skills and built a multi-million dollar business as an online marketing consultant in just a few short years. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough for him. He still wanted to be great.</p><p> He sold his half of the company to his business partner and went back to the drawing board. This time, he started to think beyond himself. What would make a truly great impact on the world? He realized it needed to be focused on serving other people.</p><p> So he started a new kind of school, which he called The School of Greatness. In the form of a podcast, he began to interview the best and brightest minds in the world about their insight on what makes greatness.</p><p> Today, he has published hundreds of episodes, has millions of downloads and shares the microphone with superstars like Tony Robbins, Julianne Hough, Arianna Huffington and Scooter Braun.</p><p> As a summary of the lessons he has learned in greatness so far and as a way to give back to an even bigger audience, he wrote a book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/School-Greatness-Real-World-Living-Leaving/dp/1623365961/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444777877&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+school+of+greatness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The School of Greatness  </a> </u> , sharing the top 8 things he has learned great people do to achieve success.</p><h3> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wh02X-4bhC0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-27-at-12.45.41-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></h3><p> click to view</p><p> Here are his lessons of greatness:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Create a Vision </strong></h3><p> <br/> Think about what you want to create in your life and how you want to live &ndash; as if anything is possible. Without a crystal clear vision of what you are going to accomplish, you won&rsquo;t know where to start. If you need to try on a few ideas before you commit, go ahead, but take action and start creating something you are excited about.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Turn Adversity Into Advantage </strong></h3><p> <br/> Adversity serves as a choice point for each one of us.  We can choose to play into a victim mindset and give our power away, or we can use challenges as opportunities to learn, grow and become stronger. As soon as you realize you have a choice in adversity, you also realize you are in control.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Cultivate a Champion&rsquo;s Mindset </strong></h3><p> <br/> An unshakeable belief in yourself and your potential may sound like a tall order, but it&rsquo;s 100% possible to create. In fact, it&rsquo;s essential if you want to graduate from average to great. Reconnect with your strengths, your passion and your ambition and cement those into your mindset.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Develop Hustle </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are going to be great, you have to be willing to do what average people are unwilling to do. Hustle means sacrifice, sweat, hard work, long days and crazy determination &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also worth it. When you hustle you are in good company; it&rsquo;s how all the A players got to where they are.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Master Your Body </strong></h3><p> <br/> Despite all the noise about what the best workout and diet truly is, it&rsquo;s less important that you find the perfect rules to follow and more important that you are conscious of your body and health everyday. The truth is, that your body is the vehicle that allows you to do what you were born to do. Once you respect that, you&rsquo;ll find the discipline to take care of your body and constantly work on improving it.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Practice Positive Habits </strong></h3><p> <br/> We are all experts at forming and keeping habits &ndash; some of them are good and a lot of them are bad. A huge part of greatness is using our ability to form habits to our advantage. It takes a lot of energy to make decisions all day long, so the more good habits you can create, the less energy you have to spend on deciding what to do for every part of your day.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Build a Winning Team </strong></h3><p> <br/> Playing solo (AKA perfectionism) might have gotten you this far, but it&rsquo;s not going to get you to your full potential. The best and biggest accomplishments are never achieved by a single person. Invest in the right kinds of relationships that complement your weaknesses and allow you to focus on your strengths.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Live a Life of Service </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can achieve greatness by just focusing on pursuing your own selfish interests, but it&rsquo;s not going to feel great. You&rsquo;ll discover quickly that greatness which only serves you is empty. Build giving back and serving others into every part of your journey and you&rsquo;ll find fulfillment and happiness long before you reach your goal of greatness.</p><p> I am so excited for Lewis&rsquo; book and his lessons. If you haven&rsquo;t already, pick up a copy of his book the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/School-Greatness-Real-World-Living-Leaving/dp/1623365961/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444778063&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=school+of+greatness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   School of Greatness  </a> </u>  or check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://lewishowes.com/podcast/vanessa-van-edwards/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   his podcast  </a> </u>  &mdash; you won&rsquo;t regret it!</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> When Periscope launched at the end of March, it was  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3#ixzz3lFowwSVB\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pitched as an improvement  </a> </u>  over the static YouTube commenting feature. Instead of a passive experience where audiences posted comments and video creators checked and responded to feedback at their leisure, Periscope was a dynamic environment, allowing live broadcasts where viewers could comment, ask questions and join in the dialogue in real-time. Viewers send hearts as a form of &ldquo;virtual applause&rdquo; and creators receive &ldquo;push notifications&rdquo; as new viewers join, which is the equivalent of watching more people walk into the room and sit down for a presentation.</p><p> The big question, of course, is: SO WHAT? After all, live streaming is nothing new; it&rsquo;s been around for the better part of a decade. However, as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.northernlightspr.com/how-will-periscope-or-meerkat-benefit-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Northern Lights PR  </a> </u>  from the UK points out, the audience for live streaming is suddenly much larger due to widespread adoption of smartphones, social media is part of our daily lives now, and Periscope was designed and integrated into the Twitter platform for easy access to your contacts there. Many a marketer head spins when thinking about the possible applications for such a tool. Thankfully, we&rsquo;ve boiled down eight of the most effective ways companies are using Periscope to boost sales conversions.</p><h3> 8 Ways to Use Periscope to Drives More Sales</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Periscope Product Launches</h3><p> <br/> Generate buzz for a new product (or the launch of exciting new product features) via Periscope.  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/product-videos-conversion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kissmetrics reports  </a> </u>  that viewers are &ldquo;anywhere from 64-85% more likely to buy&rdquo; after watching a product video. They added that housewares company StacksAndStacks.com saw a 144% increase in sales after people watched their product videos. Likewise, Advanced Auto Parts calculated that video viewers spent twice as long on their site and viewed twice as many pages as those who did not watch videos. You may not have millions of people tuning in like Apple, but live streaming is still a great way to capture the energy and excitement of a live demonstration.</p><h3> 2. Periscope Product Demos &amp; Tutorials</h3><p> <br/> Periscope is an ideal platform to show people exactly how your product works. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8287-periscope-for-business.html#sthash.4A7T74X8.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one digital marketing consultant  </a> </u>  put it, Periscope broadcasts seem more rough and unrehearsed, which gives &ldquo;the impression that your product really is that easy to use.&rdquo; This facet is especially important if you&rsquo;re marketing a high-tech product. For instance, PrecisionHawk unmanned drones used Periscope to show off a live-flight demo and conduct on-site interviews with event attendees. The great thing about live demoing is that you have the opportunity to answer questions, show an instant replay and overcome potential buyer objects right away to ensure you make the best first impression.</p><p> Often times, when watching a YouTube tutorial for something particularly complex, the presenter moves just a little too fast and we have questions along the way. A Periscope broadcast would give us the opportunity to ask to see a particular step again or ask for more information. You can imagine the applications for a DIY craft or home renovation project, cooking up a gourmet recipe, learning a new software program, or troubleshooting a tech-related problem. Not only helpful, these live tutorials then also serve to show off your expertise and build trust with your audience.</p><h3> 3. Q&amp;A Sessions on Periscope</h3><p> <br/> Q&amp;A sessions accomplish several initiatives that lead to increased sales. First, it builds trust. People like doing business with responsive companies run by experts in their fields and what better way to show that you can think on your toes than to do it in real-time? Periscope Q&amp;A sessions are unscripted and dynamic.</p><p> Secondly,  <a href=\"http://www.bitrebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/social-media-customer-service-infographic.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  buyers  </a> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bitrebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/social-media-customer-service-infographic.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   expect  </a> </u>  companies to be &ldquo;reachable&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; to their needs via social media channels, and there is no better way to connect to the concerns of your constituents than to address their questions directly in a &ldquo;town hall forum&rdquo; type setting.</p><p> Thirdly, it gives people a face to put with the company, as Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes explains. &ldquo;Because the video is live, there&rsquo;s nowhere to hide and really no room for the standard corporate spin and empty marketing phrases,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Live streaming is real and raw. This kind of vulnerability might not appeal to everyone, but it&rsquo;s an excellent way to build community and humanize a brand.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Live Tours</h3><p> <br/> Live tours are something we really push for our real estate clients, whether you&rsquo;re a builder or an agent. Certain products are best sold through experience. Nothing beats an in-person live walk-through, but in this busy and tech-savvy age, consumers are looking for ways to save time. Of course, live virtual tours also save YOU time and money!</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.360realtytampa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   360 Realty Tampa  </a> </u>  is one such company that broadcasts open houses to reach more potential buyers. &ldquo;Many times viewers are on the fence about a property and would like to see it prior to traveling. The listing is then placed on YouTube until the property is sold,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8287-periscope-for-business.html#sthash.4A7T74X8.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   explains the company&rsquo;s marketing rep  </a> </u> .</p><p> Of course, real estate is not the only industry where live tours boost sales. Healthcare is another great field where you can take parents-to-be on a tour of your maternity ward, show prospective clients your state-of-the-art sports medicine clinic, or give existing customers a sneak peek of the new renovations done at your office. Restaurants, schools, spas,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEoQFjAGahUKEwja14XDt-rHAhVKdT4KHWzmCfM&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shape.com%2Ffitness%2Fworkouts%2Ffree-fitness-classes-you-can-take-periscope&amp;usg=AFQjCNHo6TgKr5FBuRjE7tkh93pLzr7zVw&amp;sig2=BA3XkJZ3f7ggwDvOSILFbQ\" target=\"_blank\">   fitness studios  </a> </u> , new retail shops &mdash; pretty much anywhere you want people to come and do business lends itself to a Periscope live tour.</p><p> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Periscope-Infographic.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Periscope for bloggers infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Periscope-Infographic.png\"/> </a></p><h3> 5. Behind-The-Scenes</h3><p> <br/> Candid, informal looks at your company&rsquo;s day-to-day operations are surprisingly interesting to people, as evidenced by the success of reality TV programming. People love feeling connected and given a special insider glimpse. These videos work to humanize your brand and engage audiences with the story and culture of your firm.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8287-periscope-for-business.html#sthash.4A7T74X8.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Emily Schuman from Roost self-storage and parking company  </a> </u>  says they use Periscope for &ldquo;things like chats with our CEO, live talks that our COO gave at 500 Startups, and sometimes just fun things we do around the office.&rdquo;</p><p> Periscope is also a creative platform to show consumers how products are made in real-time, which emphasizes quality and strengthens trust in the brand. We can imagine this setup working really well for brewing companies, restaurants, clothing manufacturers, mattress firms, film sets, TV shows, food manufacturers, and a wide range of other businesses that pride themselves on sourcing of materials or quality production.</p><h3> 6. Announce Exclusive Promotional Deals on Periscope</h3><p> <br/> People LOVE giveaways. Since  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en-gb/2014/10-reasons-why-people-follow-brands-on-twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   52% of people follow a brand on Twitter for the special offers and promotions  </a> </u> , Periscope can be a great way to announce coupon codes, percent-off discounts, 2-for-1 sales, free samples, contests and other promotional offers to your Twitter followers. Offering special real-time deals for your Periscope viewers provides an incentive for people to tune-in, while also providing incentive to buy NOW, much like the infomercials of yesteryear.</p><p> For instance,  <u>  <a href=\"http://digiday.com/brands/5-ways-brands-using-periscope/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Taco Bell used Periscope  </a> </u>  to hold a mock press conference and invite their fans out for a free &ldquo;Biscuit Taco&rdquo; on Cinco de Mayo. Similarly, early adopter Doritos charted new territory with their #DoritosRoulette campaign, which gave Periscope stream viewers a chance to win  <u>  <a href=\"http://sweetiessweeps.com/2015/05/doritos-roulette-twitter-promotion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   over $50,000 in prizes  </a> </u> , including tablets, longboard skateboards, camcorders, turntables, speaker systems, sunglasses, noise-canceling headphones, robots and more. Reportedly,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_28589227/companies-take-advantage-live-streaming-apps-periscope-meerkat\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more than 15,000 people  </a> </u>  tuned in!</p><h3> 7. Acquire Sales Data</h3><p> <br/> Now that Periscope has acquired 4Tree, a Big Data solution company, you can be rest assured the marketing insights for your Periscope broadcasts are soon to follow. The Periscope platform is expected to ultimately help your sales performance by offering valuable insights into such details like &ldquo;next-product-to-buy recommendations&rdquo; and &ldquo;product pricing&rdquo; feedback in real-time.</p><p> Brian Elliott, CEO of PeriscopeTM, stated in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.realwire.com/releases/Periscope-a-McKinsey-Solution-acquires-4tree-enabling-Greater-Customer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a press release  </a> </u> : &ldquo;Companies are always seeking a better understanding of how customers make purchasing decisions with the range of products, prices and promotions available to them. 4tree allows us to integrate customer data at scale and generate actionable insights fast enough to enable dynamic assortment, pricing and promotions.&rdquo;</p><h3> 8. Periscope Virtual Parties &amp; Events</h3><p> <br/> Virtual Facebook parties  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/45746676\" target=\"_blank\">   have been a hit  </a> </u>  for years. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great way to spend some time with co-workers in a different way,&rdquo; explains Michael Crom from the Dale Carnegie Institute. From a sales standpoint, you can also use parties to build loyalty. Did one of your customers just have a birthday, retire, get a big promotion, have a child or grand-baby, or get back from vacation? Invite your high rolling clients to a private Periscope session to sing &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; or hold an office celebration in their honor. Showing a little bit of love keeps your brand front and center in buyers&rsquo; minds and can drive referral traffic as well.</p><p> A Periscope party can be a new way to connect with prospects, particularly when potential buyers are spread far and wide. For instance, Event organizer StartupPop.com hosted an event in Boca Raton, Florida and allowed users from elsewhere the opportunity to join in live with Periscope. At the event, 10 companies pitched their ideas in front of a panel of investors (think  <u>  <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/about-the-show\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo;  </a> </u> ). &ldquo;We had over 100 viewers and people who could not make it watch,&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8287-periscope-for-business.html#sthash.4A7T74X8.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   said founder Dan Gudema  </a> </u> .</p><p> <img alt=\"Periscope Etiquette\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/periscope-etiquette.png\"/></p>",

    "content": "<h3> Lesson learned from a child&rsquo;s science project.</h3><p> <br/> An article in the Huffington Post lists 25 time-honored 4th Grade science projects that are still popular with today&rsquo;s students. Looking back, you probably remember the top three from your own grade school days: The first experiment is to create a miniature erupting volcano by mixing baking soda with vinegar. The second is to power an electric light with a battery made from a potato and a couple nails. The third&mdash;and this is the inspiration for today&rsquo;s blog&mdash;is to demonstrate why a flimsy-looking palm tree can easily survive the same hurricane that would uproot and destroy a mighty oak. To dramatize this principle, just look at the terrifying aerial photos taken after Hurricane Yazi&mdash;history&rsquo;s strongest storm&mdash;tore across Queensland a couple years ago. The photos show a forest of 100-foot-tall trees leveled like matchsticks, while the nearby palm trees still wave gracefully in the aftermath of the storm&mdash;a little ragged, maybe, but healthy and intact. The lesson is clear: Oak trees are big, strong and deeply-rooted, but that makes them fairly rigid and unbending. Palm trees are slender and graceful, and that makes them flexible and adaptable to change.</p><p> <strong>  Are you a palm tree or an oak? </strong></p><p> As business leaders and managers, we too are experiencing one of history&rsquo;s greatest social, economic and technological storms. <strong>  Every day the winds of change blow new challenges and unprecedented opportunities your way and mine. How we react as leaders to these changes literally determines our future. </strong></p><p> If we are as smart as 4th graders, we will remember that, in times of massive change, the big, rigid, tradition-bound companies often go down&hellip;while the more flexible and adaptable companies survive and thrive.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> When I work on client websites, I&rsquo;m always amazed at how&mdash;in the end&mdash;it&rsquo;s just one change that makes all the difference.</h3><p> <br/> The difference between a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; website and the outlier that grabs your sweet-spot prospects by the shorthairs.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not the on-brand new images (although that&rsquo;s certainly part of it) or an SEO trick, the perfect &ldquo;ethical bribe&rdquo; or even some snazzy graphic design.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s simply this: you must capture your particular brand of alchemy front and center.</h3><p> <br/> How does your client&rsquo;s life change FOR THE BETTER after working with you? How do they transform?</p><p> And just to be clear, we are not talking about the steps, the process, the features of what you&rsquo;re going to do together. No sir.</p><p> We&rsquo;re talking outcomes. Results. But not just financial&mdash;show them the feeling they&rsquo;ll have after they&rsquo;ve gone through the fire with you.</p><p> The beauty of this is it doesn&rsquo;t matter what service you provide&mdash;you can be an executive coach, a self-help guru, a technology consultant or a financial advisor.</p><h3> Just focus on the feelings. On the alchemy that happens when you do your magic.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re not sure exactly how to define it, try talking to your clients. They&rsquo;ll describe it in ways you may never have considered. I once was in a meeting with a long-time client who was introducing me to a contact. He proceeded to tell a story about how my work changed his life that I&rsquo;d not heard before. I literally had no idea that a small (but routine) aspect of our work together was a game-changer for him and his partner&mdash;it wound up making them a pile of money while avoiding a blow-up over differing visions.</p><p> Hmmm. You can bet I tell THAT story now when working with multiple partners.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing. You can show your alchemy in all sorts of ways. There is no one-size-fits-all. Which of course is the beauty of it. You can create something no one can replicate&mdash;in pictures, stories, copy, video, graphic design or, better still, all of the above.</p><p> Want to understand how well your website grabs your ideal client? Start by asking yourself these questions and jotting down some very specific answers:</p><li> <strong>  What&rsquo;s the main result of your work when a particular service is completed? </strong> (And don&rsquo;t just stick to the usual: increased revenue, decreased cost.)</li><li> <strong>  What changes in the client&rsquo;s day-to-day? How are they better off from your work? </strong> What pain do they avoid or what emotional riches (more time, peace of mind, focus on what they love, etc.) will they win?</li><li> <strong>  Who is your absolute, hands-down sweet-spot client? </strong> What do they most want to hear and learn and experience? <br/>  </li><p> And then, give your website the onceover. Where and how are you showing these results and the feelings your very best clients experience? Have you developed the site just for them? Does it speak to them in YOUR voice? When you look at your site as a whole, does it tell a consistent story?</p><p> <strong>  Sidebar: beware of using a lot of jargon or overly formal copy, even for a traditional corporate audience. </strong> Showing you have deep knowledge is good. But using terms that don&rsquo;t mean the same thing to your client is deadly. They want to know they can understand you and more importantly, that you&rsquo;ll understand them.</p><p> I know it can be challenging&mdash;but it&rsquo;s worth every effort. Just keep asking yourself&mdash;where and how can I best capture my clients&rsquo; experience with me?</p><p> Because that is TRULY the one website change that will bring you more clients. <strong>  It will turn your site into what it should be: a compelling snapshot of the magic you were meant to create together. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Black Friday is synonymous with people dipping out of Thanksgiving dinners early to stand outside and wait for retail stores to open their doors. Only just a few years ago, stores didn't open their doors until Friday at 6 a.m. Then it became Friday at 4 a.m. And now we're hearing of stores opening on Thanksgiving afternoon.</p><p> Thanksgiving is quickily dissolving as Black Friday is steadily cannibalizing the holiday. And for the employees that have no choice but to skip family time to open the doors early, you can be sure they won't be engaged during their shift. Which means you can't expect them to deliver exceptional customer service.</p><p> But REI knows the importance of work-life balance.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/rei-rebels-against-black-friday/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   News broke  </a> </u>  that this retail giant is rebeling against Black Friday. Not only is REI closing their doors for the day, but they're also paying their employees to spend time in the Great Outdoors.</p><h3> REI Stays True to Their Mission</h3><p> <br/> As a store that encourages and supports people to take to nature, it only makes sense that they're replacing Black Friday with an  <u>  <a href=\"http://optoutside.rei.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #OptOutside  </a> </u>  campaign.</p><p> REI's CEO, Jerry Stritzke told CNN Money:</p><p> \"This business centers [on] the outdoors. Thus, we can do something like close our doors on Black Friday, and we'll have the membership that'll think that's cool ... You need people to go to the mountain, you need people to catch that outdoor bug.\"</p><h3> Appreciate Employees' Time Off</h3><p> <br/> Companies show employee recognition in their own way &mdash; thank-you cards, microbonuses, etc. But why not offer the most valuable form of appreciation: a day off from work.</p><p> Thanksgiving is a day set aside for people to reflect upon what they're thankful for. So by giving employees this precious day off instead of dragging them to open the doors for bargain-hunting mobs, you're showing that you care about them even outside of the workplace. And in return, they're more likely to stick around.</p><p> Don't believe us? Our most recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/lt-employee-retention-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Employee Retention Report  </a> </u>  discovered these eye-opening findings:</p><p> <img alt=\"Employee Retention Report by TINYpulse\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/443262/Screen_Shot_2015-10-26_at_8.52.21_PM.png?t=1445975245874\"/></p><p> Employee appreciation plays a huge role in retention. Give your hardworking people some work-life balance and prevent burnout by giving them a day to relax on Thanksgiving. If a huge national chain like REI can do it, we're sure you can too.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Ever get frustrated at being asked to pull together a business case for what appears to obviously be the right thing to do? If so, you should enjoy our latest guest blog post.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.custerian.com/colleagues/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Simon Norie from Custerian  </a> </u>  shares his thoughts on how to deal with this frustration&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Can&rsquo;t we just do what our customers want us to do?  </strong></p><p> We get this comment a lot when it comes to putting change in. The &ldquo;they have said I need a cost benefit case &ndash; surely they should just know we need to do this?&rdquo; cry for help. In today&rsquo;s world of agile, aligned ways of working, where billion &pound; business&rsquo;s are created virtually overnight, you might think we would come out in support of a position that says: If it&rsquo;s aligned to Customer needs, then you should just do it. But we don&rsquo;t and that is because doing a cost benefit (or business case, or return on investment etc) has a lot of merit.</p><p> Here are a few:</p><li> It encourages cross functional working &ndash; no bad thing for creating alignment between a brand and its customers through its colleagues &ndash; a big driver of Brand Empathy &amp; Customer Loyalty.</li><li> You should know what it &lsquo;costs to serve&rsquo; your brand to your customers. How else can you focus your efforts correctly on doing things that add value to the customer?</li><li> The basic tenet of all business is simple &ndash; create something at a cost of Y, sell it at a price of X. As long as the amount you spend on &lsquo;selling&rsquo; your product is less than X minus Y, then you&rsquo;re making money. <br/>  </li><p> And finally it has another major bonus &ndash; The plans you have for change are significantly more likely to get approved because most of us work in business&rsquo;s where the final arbiter for approval is ROI (Return On Investment).</p><p> As with many things, it&rsquo;s not about if you should do something or not, it&rsquo;s about how.</p><p> <strong>  So how do you go about building a cost benefit case?  </strong></p><p> So a bit like our thin strategy approach (keep it clear, customer centric, emotionally engaging &amp; with a clear financial outcome), we have a view on cost benefits. You should be able to quickly access the cost, and therefore the benefit of any changes you wish to make, on an ongoing basis. It should be a core part of your decision-making process.</p><p> Here are some tips on how to do this:</p><li> Involve your finance team &ndash; especially anyone who has a title such as Cost Accountant. Finance are all about helping business make sensible decisions &ndash; especially improving the X-Y equation stuff.</li><li> Create a high-level view of the major steps involved in &lsquo;selling&rsquo; your product (or service) to the customer. It helps to do this as an internal Process Map and not a Customer Journey map initially.</li><li> This Process Map will usually involve actions within discrete areas of the business and will be focussed on hand over points. A good way of doing it is a quick huddle with your peers to work out the input/output, handovers and metrics.</li><li> Once you have got the high level process &amp; metrics, the finance team can look at the cost incurred in each stage. There is usually more to this than taking the departmental budget and dividing it by the &lsquo;product&rsquo; volume. But often, it is that simple.</li><li> Now you will have a high level map of the &lsquo;process&rsquo; your business goes though to sell its product or service. You will also have the steps, metrics and cost &ndash; in short you have a Cost To Serve Model that details the process, measurement &amp; cost for getting from X to Y. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Is it really that easy? In short&hellip; yes.  </strong></p><p> But as with most things in business, what can be an easy thing to outline in 5 steps, proves a bit more difficult in real life. Usually because a lot of informal internal process builds up to protect functional budgets.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t be distracted and again this is where Finance come in. They have a cross functional remit, so they can help look across functions and ensure the end result has credibility.</p><p> <strong>  But how does this help build a benefits case?  </strong></p><p> Once you have a Cost To Serve Model (specifically the metrics by process step aligned to the cost), you can used it to test the outcomes of different ways of doing things.</p><p> The biggest gain you can get to quickly using this approach is to look at the true cost/impact of failure. This can be both the downstream (perhaps a logistic failure) or upstream (bad service experience) impact of getting something wrong. Because you can see how much cost you have wasted, or how much you are going to have to expend rectifying it.</p><p> And guess what, the same peer group that helped create the cost to serve model, will almost certainly know what could be done to flex the model to improve it. More than that, you will be able to look at what the ripple though effect is of changes in one area on others.</p><p> Even better. This team, who will have a business wide view of the process used to &lsquo;sell&rsquo; your products to your customers, can also then use Customer Experience methods to identify what areas of the process should be looked at to create even greater benefit &ndash; but that is not for now.</p><p> <strong>  Surely this is too simplistic a view of things. </strong></p><p> I understand that thought. But equally I have worked for a lot of very large companies, in both the service and product sectors and my general experience is this:</p><li> Sophisticated modelling &ndash; when it exists &ndash; is deep at a functional process level. Business has tended to develop a lot of ways of working (for what used to be and can still be, good reasons) that are functionally orientated.</li><li> Business wide modelling &ndash; when it exists &ndash; is remote from the main business and done as part of a directorate level strategic planning process, so may not filter far enough down a business. <br/>  </li><p> My view is few companies have a got a workable view on their cost to serve model at a level of visibility and understanding that means the colleagues working in the business day in day out, can make a significant impact.</p><p> It is also worth saying that even at this high level, you need to maintain a rigour over the metrics and costs that are being used. The old adage of rubbish in, rubbish out, is always true and high level does not mean lots of &lsquo;best guess&rsquo; variables will be ok.</p><p> But getting your Cost To Serve Model into this format, means the people who can make the biggest difference every day, have the means to do so.</p><p> Do you agree with Simon?  <strong>  What&rsquo;s your experience of driving Customer Insight led changes &amp; did a business case help? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Years ago, I lived next door to an older man who would spend his days sitting on his front porch complaining about life and yelling at the kids who would go by his Main Street house. He was not a pleasant fellow, and I seldom saw him do anything besides sit on his porch and yell at people and things. His wife would often escape his wrath by spending hours watching TV inside the house.The few times that I had spoken with him, he would rattle off his complaints about politics, sports, neighbors and animals. I wanted to ask him if anything made him happy, but I think that it was clear that complaining about everything was the only thing that made him happy.Whatever joy he had once had seemed lost. When I recognized that, I did feel pity for him, but honestly, it didn't lead me to have many other conversations with him.</p>He was your prototypical grouchy old man. For many, that's the stereotype of the grumpy old retiree; living off of his pension and telling any one younger than him how great the world used to be.However, I'm sure that you also know those people who are experiencing joy and living life to its fullest in retirement. Whether it's continue to work (now in a job that they enjoy), traveling or volunteering in organizations where their heart is, these modern day retirees have spun that stereotype on its head, which is a good thing.Retirement now is about evolution and personal growth. Retirement has become a time to utilize the new found freedom to explore one's own belief systems to find peace and to live life fully with a positive attitude.It's been my belief that one of the keys to living longer, and thriving, in retirement depends upon having a positive attitude. Research has shown that seniors who continue to take an active part in their lives and view life in a positive light &ndash; those who don't see retirement as an end but as a beginning &ndash; live longer and are happier. These are the people who have gained the wisdom to enjoy their later years to the fullest, and it will ultimately extend their later years.A <u> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/business/retirementspecial/the-science-of-older-and-wiser.html\" target=\"_blank\">  recent article in the New York Times </a></u> points out that,\"Most psychologists agree that if you define wisdom as maintaining positive well-being and kindness in the face of challenges, it is one of the most important qualities one can possess to age successfully &mdash; and to face physical decline and death.\"Retirement and one's later years brings many challenges. We may lose friends and family. Our bodies don't work as well as they used to. There are many things that can beat us down and make us into that miserable old neighbor of mine.In the article, <u> <a href=\"https://med.virginia.edu/wisdom/publications/ardelt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Monika Ardelt </a></u>, an associate sociology professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville,\"felt a need to expand on studies of old age because of research showing that satisfaction late in life consists of things like maintaining physical and <u> <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/mentalhealthanddisorders/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" target=\"_blank\">  mental health </a></u>, volunteering and having positive relationships with others.\"These aspects of life are often the things that can help us to not only survive the challenges of our later years, but to move past them and gain the wisdom to enjoy our later years to the fullest. That wisdom is as, Professor Ardelt finds \"the ace in the hole that can help severely impaired people find meaning, contentment and acceptance in later life.\"There is much research out there that correlates a positive attitude to a longer life. <u> <a href=\"http://dontgiveuponthem.com/index.php/2011/08/positive-attitude-extends-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jan Simpson on her blog </a></u> writes about <u> <a href=\"http://www.positivityratio.com/author.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dr. Barbara L. Fredrickson </a></u>, a psychologist and researcher at UNC-Chapel Hill, who has done much work in this area and has even put together <u> <a href=\"http://www.positivityratio.com/single.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a tool to gauge your positivity ratio </a></u>. Simpson reports that through her work,\"Fredrickson discovered that experiencing positive emotions vs. negative emotions in a 3-to-1 ratio leads people to a tipping point beyond which they naturally become more resilient to adversity.\"It's this resiliency that leads to living longer through challenges, and Professor Fredericksen goes on to state that,\"this may be the wisdom of old age: a focus on positivity can make late life fulfilling, despite the inevitable aches, pains, and memory loss.\"I often think that things would've been different for my old neighbor if he found his way to a positive attitude.",

    "content": "<h3> In our firm, we interview potential clients. Maybe they want to hire us, but do we want to work with them? Sometimes the answer is no.</h3><p> <br/> We can often tell before we even talk to them. Before talking to a potential client, we ask that they fill out our online  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sensiblemoney.com/premeeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pre-Meeting Questions  </a> </u>  (PMQ). Their attitude and biases often show in the questions they ask.</p><p> In one recently submitted PMQ, a woman explained that she had just sold a business, had several million to invest, was in her late 40s, and wanted to retire. That all sounds fine. Then she said, \"I would need to know your company's track record and performance with returns that are verifiable in order to consider your firm to help with achieving returns on my principal so I can live on the interest.\"</p><p> One of my experienced and well-credentialed co-workers replied to her. She responded by saying she would only talk with a senior partner or owner of the firm. Responding this way is one sure way to get on my bad side. The people I have hired are exceptional, and I am only one person. I cannot speak to everyone.</p><p> I thought carefully about my reply. Although I already knew she was probably not  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/does-your-adviser-share-your-fiscalosophy-2013-10-11\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a good fit for our services  </a> </u> , I was still concerned about the kind of adviser she might choose, and so in my reply I said,</p><p> \"Track records are completely irrelevant to building a portfolio that can deliver income for life. I have watched lots of people lose plenty of money because someone showed them a good track record. Every prospectus states \"past performance is not an indication of future results\" because it is true.</p><p> &ldquo;If you are planning on hiring someone based on their track record, you will most certainly find someone who is willing to show you one that probably looks darn good, and will have nothing to do with your future outcome. Bernie Madoff had a phenomenal track record.</p><p> &ldquo;No one can predict the future. Generating income for an unknown lifetime, with unknown inflation and unknown economic circumstances is not about track record. It is about risk management and taking steps to make sure that even in a worst-case economic scenario you have an acceptable outcome. It is about education and managing uncertainty.\"</p><h3> Amazingly enough, she replied, once again asking for our historical track record.</h3><p> <br/> Folks, if this is how you shop for investment advice, don't come crying to me when you get ripped off.</p><p> Get some common sense. Just stop and think for a minute. There are what, about 9 billion people in the world? A lot of them super smart and well educated (Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford, etc.). They have access to super computers that can process data at lightning speeds. And yet you think the investment adviser or financial planner sitting across the conference room table has \"the edge?\"</p><p> Let me tell you a secret. There isn't an investment adviser, MarketWatch reporter (no disrespect &mdash; I like MarketWatch), or Goldman Sachs employee that can guarantee you a successful future track record. They don't really know if gold is going to spike or if Apple is about to make a comeback. They are simply glorified educated guessers.</p><p> And the investment adviser showing you their great performance? I could use any one of numerous software platforms to create a fabulous looking hypothetical report that would show a great track record. I won't because I think it is false and misleading, but in that respect, I'm the anomaly in my industry, not the standard.</p><p> You know  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investing-lessons-from-ponzi-and-madoff-2013-06-17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   why Bernie Madoff was able to pull off his scam  </a> </u>  to such a massive magnitude?

Long before the regulators would listen, investment professionals recognized that it simply wasn't possible to deliver the returns he said he was delivering.

    "content": "<p> Early in my career I was idealistic, opinionated, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that my mouth&rsquo;s filter was defective.  I remember sitting in meetings in my early 20&rsquo;s, voicing my thoughts and ideas with abandon, not questioning how they might land.  I of course thought I was &ldquo;right&rdquo; about most everything, and wasn&rsquo;t afraid to say so.  Are many of the leaders who are reading this, shuddering at the thought of having someone like my younger-self on your team?  I suspect so.  I am.</p><p> Most people would say that this was politically foolish &ndash; and they&rsquo;d be right.  Lucky for me, it was a small consulting firm and my boss was pretty conflict-adverse. He just smiled and nodded silently during the meetings, while my colleagues shifted in their seats uncomfortably.  He pretty much left me on my own, and since I was a self-directed high-achiever, that worked for both of us.  I worked my way up as far as one could go in a 7-person organization, and when the only place left to grow was out, I left.  Surprisingly, he didn&rsquo;t fight that.  Can&rsquo;t imagine why&hellip;  Reflecting back, I&rsquo;m a bit embarrassed.</p><p> As I&rsquo;ve matured I&rsquo;m still a tad idealistic and opinionated but I&rsquo;ve come to recognize the wisdom in thinking before I speak.  Not because of ambition, (although my blurting-ways could&rsquo;ve surely been a career-killer) but because I really wanted to make a difference.  And to make a difference I needed to be able to influence.</p><p> The thing is, people can&rsquo;t be influenced if they stop listening to you.</p><p> <strong>  People can&rsquo;t be influenced if they stop listening to you. </strong></p><p> As Maya Angelou so poignantly said, &ldquo;People will forget what you&rsquo;ve said.  People will forget what you did.  But people never forget how you made them feel.&rdquo;</p><p> That applies to when you make them feel crappy too.</p><p> One thing I know for sure, is that when we make people wrong, they don&rsquo;t want to listen to us any longer.  &ldquo;Talk to the hand!&rdquo;  And when we don&rsquo;t treat people with respect, they don&rsquo;t want to listen to us any longer.  Any why should they?</p><p> And if we want people to listen to us &ndash; really listen &ndash; then we have to be willing to really listen to them as well.</p><p> Influence is more than being a crafty spin doctor &ndash; saying whatever you need to say to get people to agree.  It&rsquo;s more than bulldozing over others, in attempt to get them to do it your way.  Influence is much harder.  To influence, we need to pay attention to how we&rsquo;re making others feel &ndash; for real.  How they feel about us.  How they feel about themselves.  How they feel about about the issues at hand.  How they feel.</p><p> <strong>  To influence, we need to pay attention to how we&rsquo;re making others feel &ndash; for real. </strong></p><p> How can you say what you need to say constructively and mindfully to ensure that the way they feel when you speak will lead them to want to listen?</p><p> So start working on that filter!  Because both of us know that the world needs someone to make a difference and if you have something valuable to say, it&rsquo;s important to find a way to be heard.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Is it really everyone's job? </strong> <br/> <br/> Pundits and experts alike say that customer experience is everyone's job. If you google \"customer experience is everyone's job\" and \"customer service is everyone's job,\" you'll find endless articles, blogs, and webinars with that very title. <br/> <br/> It's true. Technically, it iseveryone's job.  <br/> <br/> The spirit of the statement, though, is this:  <strong>  every employee impacts the customer experience </strong> , whether he's part of your frontline interacting with customers face to face/phone to phone or she's behind the scenes making sure the website works well or designing brochures to describe your products. Every employee matters; every employee contributes. <br/> <br/> It seems like that's just one more proof point that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/09/the-employee-experience-customer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the employee experience comes first - and drives the customer experience  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> So it kills me when I see so many job postings for \"customer experience\" roles. In this regard... NO, customer experience is not everyone's job. I've seen positions posted with titles of Customer Experience This or Customer Experience That. Ironically, the postings were really sales/retail  positions or call center/customer service jobs. And sadly, many of the job descriptions never even mentioned the customer! How can that be? <br/> <br/> I am an active member (and a Board Member) of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cxpa.org/?\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Customer Experience Professionals Association  </a> </u> ; my colleagues and I are fighting to get recognition for the customer experience profession. This means that we're looking to legitimize, validate, or otherwise verify or confirm that if your job entails listening to the customer and using what you hear to develop and to execute on a customer experience strategy, or if you oversee a team of folks doing the same, or if you are tasked with ensuring the entire organization drives toward a better customer experience, then you are a customer experience professional. If that's the case, then your title should have the words \"customer experience.\" (If you're a consultant who consults on one and the same, it's fine if your title contains those words, too.) <br/> <br/> Instead, what we've found is that, with the popularization of customer experience roles and the push to improve the customer experience, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, making it trendy to put \"customer experience\" in every title. Unfortunately, this simple action dilutes the profession and what we're trying to do. <br/> <br/> The good news is, customer experience has gained attention. The bad news is, with that, it can also become meaningless. When job descriptions have a customer experience title but never mention the customer in the actual description, a major fail has occurred. <br/> <br/> What should you do? <br/> <br/> Do your job, the one you're hired for. You don't have to have \"customer experience\" in your title in order to prove that you impact the experience. If you're a true customer experience professional, one whose role is to make customer experience management an integral part of how their companies operate, do all that you can to stay true to the profession... for yourself and for those around you. For those whose job is to deliver a great customer experience, give the CX professional a chance - they are taking what they hear from customers and translating it into a story to help you deliver a great experience. <br/> <br/> In the end, yes, we are all responsible for ensuring our customers have a great experience - title or not. How will you execute?  <br/> <br/> When it comes to creating a great customer experience, everyone within the company is committed to doing what it takes to succeed. -Quotepedia  <br/>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> I know niche marketing can be scary; you worry that you will lose out on more business than you will gain, but this can&rsquo;t be further from the truth. Through all of my personal experiences as well as working with thousands of financial advisors I have yet to see that happen. In fact the opposite has always proven true!</p><p> <strong>  Niche marketing is probably the number one most important factor in accelerating your ability to achieve success. </strong>  I realized the benefits when I built my own financial advisory practice, from day one everything I did was built around the needs and issues of wise women in Newport Beach, my tribal market. This targeted approach allowed me to build a successful financial advisory practice in less time and with less effort simply because I stayed focused on the needs of these women.</p><p> When I started my independent coaching practice in 2004 I applied the same approach and continued to focus on women, I relaunched my website emphasizing my passion around marketing to women. Since then I have experienced a steady flow of new business coming in the door.  I receive random emails from advisors asking about my marketing to women process. I am receiving more referrals from existing clients and resurrecting former clients. But it&rsquo;s not just the flow of new business it&rsquo;s the focus  <strong>  I have, the energy I feel that makes my business exciting again. </strong>  </p><p> By narrowing my market I am learning about so many new opportunities within the female advisory world that can enhance my business as well as the value I bring to my clients.</p><p> So why didn&rsquo;t I do this sooner?  I had the dream, the idea for some time; I even had the website built a year ago.  It wasn&rsquo;t until my coaches (two fabulous women) heard my passion and enthusiasm around working with and marketing to women that they asked &ldquo;Adri, why aren&rsquo;t you doing this NOW?&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t have an answer.  So with their help I rekindled my dream and began refocusing my efforts on what I know is my true calling.</p><p> <strong>  If you truly want to succeed, succeed in a way that brings you monetary, emotional and personal satisfaction.  </strong>  If you want to create a practice that attracts more ideal clients effortlessly, niche marketing must become your total focus and driving force.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> In the first nine months of 2015, Charles Schwab clients pulled $1.6 billion of net assets out of mutual funds, while adding $23 billion to ETFs. While this isconsistent with broader industry trends, favoring ETFs, we think a closer look at Charles Schwab and peer Fidelity's own fund flows is enlightening.</h3><p> <br/> Unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade intraday on an exchange and incur trading costs much like a stock. Schwab and Fidelity are not the only platforms to allow clients to trade certain ETFs commission free, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade do so as well, but the former two are distinct in offering their own products that sit side-by-side with other ETFs from other more dedicated ETF managers.</p><p> Besides offering commission free trades on its platform for certain products from Guggenheim, PowerShares, and WisdomTree, Charles Schwab also runs 17 equity ETFs and 4 bond ETFs and we think these products have among the more popular on Schwab's One Source platform. Most of these Schwab ETFs are ranked favorably from our performance, risk and cost factor perspective. The largest, Schwab US Broad Market, has $5 billion in assets, a 0.04% net expense ratio and trades for a $0.03 bid/ask spread. It provides exposure to large-, mid- and small-cap stocks, while seeking to replicate a market-cap weighted S&amp;P Dow Jones index. The ETF ranks favorably in part for its low-risk holdings.</p><p> In August 2013, Schwab launched five ETFs constructed and rebalanced annually based on factors such as sales and cash flow. One of them is Schwab Fundamental US Broad Market Index, which has $205 million in assets and tracks a FTSE Russell index. FNDB has a higher 0.32% expense ratio than SCHB and trades with a wider bid/ask spread. Relative to SCHB, FNDB has less exposure to financials and more to consumer staples stocks.</p><p> Through September, investors put $8.2 billion into Schwab's equity ETFs, much higher than the $881 million that went into Schwab's own equity mutual funds. Before you question the data given the outflows most mutual funds have experienced this year, note that six of Schwab's largest equity mutual funds are index based.</p><h3> According to Morningstar's fund flows, investors pulled $150 billion out of active mutual funds and ETFs in the 12 months ended September and added $461 billion to passive products.</h3><p> <br/> Schwab's passive mutual fund lineup is led by Schwab S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, which has $20 billion in assets and has a 0.09% expense ratio. Meanwhile, Schwab 1000 Index Fund has $6 billion in assets and replicates a proprietary index.</p><p> While Schwab's decision six years ago to add a broad array of low-cost ETFs has helped make it the seventh largest ETF provider at the end of September with $34 billion in assets according to etf.com, just ahead of Guggenheim, discount brokerage peer Fidelity was just outside the top-20 with $2.8 billion in assets.</p><p> Fidelity has more than $162 billion in ETF assets under administration and provides its brokerage customers access to many ETFs, including 70 iShares, that they can buy commission-free online.</p><p> Fidelity has a 12-year-old Fidelity NSDAQ Composite Tracking Index ETF, but in October 2013 we think Fidelity made its ETF presence notable with the launch of ten passive U.S sector ETFs. These products include Fidelity MSCI Health Care and Fidelity MSCI  Information Technology. With approximately $670 million in assets, FHLC is the  largest of those ten. It has a modest 0.12% expense ratio and trades with a $0.01 bid/ask spread.</p><p> Since then, Fidelity added three actively managed bond ETFs in October 2014 and a 11th sector ETF offering sole exposure to REITs in February 2015. We think Fidelity's bond ETFs remain small, in part because of how they performed versus cheaper passive alternatives during their short history.</p><p> Fidelity Total Bond ETF is the largest of these ETFs with $118 million in assets. FBND rose 0.6% in the one past year, but it lagged the 2.2% gain for the passively managed and popular iShares Core Aggregate Bond.</p><p> FBND trades side-by-side with AGG on Fidelity's platform commission free, but its 0.45% expense ratio is more than five times higher.</p><p> According to Lipper, Fidelity's equity and bond ETFs gathered $58 million and $112 million, respectively, in the first nine months of 2015.</p><p> In contrast, Fidelity's equity mutual funds lost $12 billion in assets in the same period. According to Fidelity, the majority of this is due to retirement plans converting assets to collective investment trusts (CITs). CITs tend to have lower costs than mutual fund versions of the same portfolio but are not part of Lipper fund flows data.</p><p> However, we think Fidelity's base is also impacted by investors rotating away from actively managed funds. Fidelity has 19 mutual fund share classes with greater than $10 billion in assets, 15 of which are active mutual funds.</p><p> Fidelity Contrafund, with $73 billion is the largest such fund, focused on large-cap growth equities. While the fund has outperformed its peers on a one- three- and five year total return basis through September, the fund lagged the S&amp;P 500 Growth index in the latter two periods.</p><p> Meanwhile, Fidelity's bond mutual funds gathered $9.3 billion in assets in the first nine months of 2015 and this business is similarly made of investors seeking to outperform an index. The seven largest bond fund classes are active led by Fidelity Strategic Advisers Core Income (FPCIX 11 ***). This is fund of funds offering that includes strategies from DoubleLine, JP Morgan, Metropolitan West, PIMCO and others.</p><p> S&amp;P Capital IQ has rankings of nearly 1,100 equity and fixed income ETFs and 17,000 such mutual funds. Rankings are based on performance, risk and cost factors, including holdings analysis. Commissions are not factored in our research.</p>",

On October 19th, we witnessed a textbook case of a behavioral bias we call <u> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/university/behavioral_finance/behavioral8.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;Herd Following&rdquo; </a></u>. Here&rsquo;s the story of how $700 million was generated out of thin air by the oracle of Chicago that knew her herd would follow.Herd Follower (noun): someone who has a tendency to stampede into investments with exuberance and sell out of fear (with a crowd of likeminded people). On Monday, October 19th, it was announced that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Oprah Winfrey </u>  </a>was investing $46 Million (a 10% stake) in <u> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance?cid=667183%20\" target=\"_blank\">  Weight Watchers International, Inc (WTW) </a></u>. The news of this investment sparked investors to follow driving the stock price up 105% to close at $13.92.If Oprah jumped off of a cliff, would your clients follow?If Oprah jumped off a cliff, would your clients follow? If you had any clients ask about Weight Watchers, then yes. Yes, they would follow. At the opening bell on October 19th, WTW opened at $6.78 and the analyst reports were grim. At the announcement of Oprah&rsquo;s investment, the trading volume of the stock rose 61x its normal rate. This generated $700 million in value for Weight Watcher shareholders, but industry analysts are predicting this is only short term success. This is a textbook case of <u> <a href=\"http://financialdna.com/financial-dna-natural-behavior/#tab-id-4%20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  herd following </a></u>, an instinctual behavioral bias that influences clients to make irrational decisions.The breaking news of Oprah&rsquo;s investment allowed investors to forget:<li> The company&rsquo;s stock had lost nearly 73% of its value in 2015.</li><li> A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/weight-watchers-tries-a-new-strategy-2014-12\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Duke University study  </a> </u>  found that Weight Watcher members lose only an average of 5 pounds at a cost of $377 per year.</li><li> Sales have declined for seven quarters with executives blaming the popularity of new free apps from competitors such like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.myfitnesspal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MyFitnessPal  </a> </u>  which beat Weight Watchers are usability and price.</li><li> There is no clear direction for the future of the program.</li><a href=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ryans-Blog-Photo-21.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Ryans Blog Photo 2\" src=\"http://www.dnabehavior.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ryans-Blog-Photo-21.png\"/></a>Stopping your clients from jumping:I would bet my money (and that&rsquo;s saying a lot because I am a saver) on the fact that your clients that are herd following Oprah are also extraverts. Just like these same clients want to keep up with the Jones&rsquo; they also don&rsquo;t want to miss out on a train that is leaving the station (especially not the Oprah Train). As you are dealing with your client, remember that extraverted clients like verbal, (in-person conversations) because this how they learn and how they are most comfortable.<li> Call your client and invite them to lunch or to the office to learn (if you need to, tell them Oprah will be there kidding).</li><li> Tip: Have your extraverted client bring a friend. They are excellent networkers and would love learning about the market with friends or family.</li><li> Explain what the Jones&rsquo; are doing and how your client can get on board.</li><li> Leave the industry reports behind: Don&rsquo;t drown your client&rsquo;s in paperwork. Keep the conversation light at first and make the conversation fun and exciting with lots of animation.</li>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/lessons-from-a-study-of-perfect-pitch-decks-vcs-spend-an-average-of-3-minutes-44-seconds-on-them/#.5udsaf:Jsiz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TechCrunch  </a> </u>  story revealed how little time venture capitalists spend looking at pitch decks.</p><p> Successful pitch decks &mdash; the ones that went on to raise money.</p><p> 3 minutes, 44 seconds to be exact, spread over 19 slides on average. That works out to &lt; 12 seconds per slide.</p><p> Yikes!</p><p> Again, these were  successful  decks. Combined, the 200 pitch decks analyzed raised $360 million from investors. No word on how long the same investors looked at  unsuccessful  pitch decks (2 minutes, 44 seconds? 1 minutes, 44 seconds?)</p><p> Now before throwing your hands up and thinking it&rsquo;s not worth putting in the time to get your deck right, OR conversely, putting more of your precious time into the deck, hoping to tack on a few extra seconds of interest from investors, remember this&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Your Pitch Deck is only ONE part of the fundraising process. </strong></p><p> While it&rsquo;s an important part (hellz yeah!) it is still only ONE part. There&rsquo;s no need to stress about the short attention spans of venture capitalists, angels or other investors. Instead, concentrate on your entire fundraising strategy, from start to finish. Congruence is the word.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what you should do to give your pitch deck the best chance for success:</p><p> <strong>  Study a firm&rsquo;s investment philosophy. </strong>  Investment firms normally state their investing thesis everywhere &mdash; website, marketing collateral. This way they attract like-minded entrepreneurs while repelling contrarian types. Do yourself (and them) a solid by reading it before contacting them.</p><p> Ask yourself whether this firm&rsquo;s value system lines up with yours (e.g., do they normally take on an  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advisory role  </a> </u> ?). Could you imagine partnering with them long-term? You gotta be thinking 5,  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/crunchbase-reveals-the-average-successful-startup-raises-41m-exits-at-242-9m/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   7  </a> </u> , 10 years out for your startup. If the answer to either question is no, find someone else. There are plenty of other sugar daddies in the startup universe.</p><p> Understand that investment firms have solid reasons for why they invest. If they pass on you, don&rsquo;t bother arguing or trying to convince them to change their mind. Just say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; and move on. Raising money is more about  <strong>  quality pitches </strong>  than  <strong>  quantity pitches </strong> . You will get more meetings if you contact more investors, but not necessarily  <u>  <a href=\"https://docsend.com/view/p8jxsqr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more money  </a> </u> .</p><p> Remember, you&rsquo;re looking to leave meetings with a  <u>  check in hand </u> , not polite applause.</p><p> <strong>  See who they&rsquo;ve funded. </strong>  The type of investments a firm has made to date will give you a good indication of whether they&rsquo;d be interested in your company. Investment firms usually advertise their portfolio right on their website. The startups that have generated the biggest returns will get top billing. You can also use third-party platforms like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.venturefocus.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   VentureFocus  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://angel.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AngelList  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://venture360.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Venture360  </a> </u>  to examine the strategy and portfolio of an investment firm.</p><p> Now obviously, if you notice that they&rsquo;ve already funded a direct competitor of yours, you probably don&rsquo;t wanna contact them. The reason being that savvy investors try not to cannibalize their portfolio.</p><p> <strong>  Study the pitch decks in their portfolio. </strong> Although as the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/answers/mperf.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC  </a> </u>  likes to remind us, past performance does not necessarily predict future results, often it does. That is to say, if a pitch deck worked 1X, it might work 2X. Just google &ldquo;XYZ Company pitch deck&rdquo; and you can see what format worked for them. Startups are a lot less protective of their  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/hnshah/mintcom-prelaunch-pitch-deck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   old decks  </u>    </a> nowadays, because you really can&rsquo;t steal the important IP stuff.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/pitchenvy/square-pitch-deck\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SlideShare  </a> </u>  is packed with old pitch decks.</p><p> Study your investor&rsquo;s backgrounds, especially before sending a cold email (&ldquo;we both hate the new Star Wars trailer!&rdquo;). Even if you can get a warm introduction, it&rsquo;s always good to have something in common for reference purposes.</p><p> This is NOT ass kissing or groveling, just sales psychology. Investors are people and they prefer doing business with other people who they know, like and trust. A lot of investment firms, especially the newer ones, exist because of personal connections from work, school or hobbies.</p><p> Peter Thiel, venture capitalist and PayPal founder, recommends probing deep into the background of your investor targets. For example, if one of them  <u>  wrote a book </u> , read it. If another one has been on TV, watch the interview. If a third owns a restaurant, try it out. This will help you pick up the subtle clues about an investor&rsquo;s priorities. Most other founders won&rsquo;t bother with this step. When you know a person&rsquo;s background, you can personalize every aspect of the  <u>  pitching process </u> , setting your company apart.</p><p> <strong>  The actual Pitch Deck </strong></p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve selected a list of investors to reach out to, you can get started on your deck. Your deck should follow good design principles &mdash; clean lines, punchy copy, sharp images and short bullet points. Your slides gotta emphasize the  <u>  3 T&rsquo;s </u>  (Team, Technology, Traction). Create as few slides as possible (but as many as necessary).</p><p> Your pitch deck has to answer the BIG questions any shrewd investor would ask. Variations of those questions are:</p><li> Why does this (problem) matter?</li><li> Why should I care?</li><li> Why now?</li><li> How is your product different (from everything else)?</li><li> Is this inevitable? <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelrwolfe?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Wolfe  </a> </u>  says he sees a lot of entrepreneurs scrambling to answer these questions once they&rsquo;ve secured a meeting with investors. This is exactly backwards. As he  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/10/23/what-should-be-in-a-pitch-deck/\" target=\"_blank\">   says  </a> </u> , &ldquo;you need the answers because <strong>  you need the answers </strong> , not to impress VCs.&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonlk?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jason Lemkin  </a> </u>  says you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;win&rdquo; if your deck can answer all the right questions without having anyone there to present it.</p><p> Your deck is not a one-shot miracle pill, it&rsquo;s a quick-n-dirty version of where your company is now. Hopefully this article has taken away some of the mystique around pitch decks.</p><p> While it&rsquo;s always tempting to look at the early decks of massive companies like  <u>  Airbnb </u>  and think funding success is a mystery of the universe, it&rsquo;s really not. Early investors at Airbnb saw what could be, rather than what was. They did not get sidetracked by the deck&rsquo;s crudeness, realizing that the team and the idea was better than the packaging.</p><p> If all a pitch deck needed to secure funding were beautiful, intuitive and clean design, then EVERY creative agency would be cranking out winners. That just ain&rsquo;t so. Great design flows out of a startup&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+job+quotes+about+design&amp;client=gmail&amp;rls=aso&amp;authuser=0&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=yUYYxPDNZuFGrM%253A%253BcqJb-xrwl6ulAM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.phonearena.com%25252Fnews%25252FSteve-Jobs-probably-would-have-liked-the-Apple-Pencil_id73815&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=yUYYxPDNZuFGrM%253A%252CcqJb-xrwl6ulAM%252C_&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;usg=__fugklzSpR-b9-BoBNgAuL5Xe8No%3D&amp;ved=0CCkQyjdqFQoTCPy_mdes3MgCFQJ9iAod8BAHfA&amp;ei=-R8sVrzfJIL6oQTwoZzgBw#imgrc=yUYYxPDNZuFGrM%3A&amp;usg=__fugklzSpR-b9-BoBNgAuL5Xe8No%3D\" target=\"_blank\">   work  </a> </u> , mission and unique talent.

    "content": "<p> Last Thursday I had the pleasure of attending an intensive daylong ETF conference in Austin, just up the road from our office in San Antonio. Hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald, the conference was designed for institutional investors.</p><p> Welcoming the group was Reginald &ldquo;Reggie&rdquo; Browne, the &ldquo;Godfather of ETFs,&rdquo; who now serves as the senior managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. His celebrity and prominence are nearly as big as his six-foot-five frame&mdash;and with good reason. Reggie has been instrumental in building the ETF landscape over the last decade and convincing investors of the power of the exchange-traded fund.</p><p> One of the panels featured chief investment officers from the Texas Teacher Retirement System (TRS). Jase Auby, Lee Partridge and Tom Tull discussed potential shifts in asset allocation under a rising interest rate environment, among other topics.</p><p> The TRS, one of the largest pension funds in the U.S., makes significant use of gold in its investment strategy, holding the yellow metal in many forms over the years. The same is true for the $20 billion University of Texas endowment fund.</p><p> Bruce Zimmerman, chief investment officer for UTIMCO,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/42682491\" target=\"_blank\">   told CNBC in 2011  </a> </u>  that the $20 billion endowment holds gold as a diversifier and hedge against currencies. This is precisely what we tell investors, and it&rsquo;s validating to see such huge funds put it in practice.</p><p> During the ETF panel, I asked Jase, Lee, Tom and moderator Ronnie Jung about their thoughts on real interest rates and their relationship with gold. Everyone&rsquo;s speculating on when the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, but real interest rates, as I  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/will-gold-finish-2015-with-a-gain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   shared with you this week  </u>  , </a>  appear to have already risen. (As a reminder, real interest rates are what you get when you deduct the monthly rate of inflation from the 10-year Treasury yield.) A 10 percent upswing in the U.S. dollar is equivalent to the federal funds rate being hiked 100 basis points.</p><p> This has had a huge effect on the yellow metal. When real rates are negative, gold has tended to do well. Conversely, when they&rsquo;re positive&mdash;and rising, as they are now&mdash;it&rsquo;s been a headwind for gold. This relationship was confirmed by the research of Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist for Stifel, who visited our office last week.</p><p> I also appreciated the TRS group&rsquo;s bullishness on China. Their position is that, because everyone is negative on China right now, all sorts of investment opportunities open up from a contrarian point of view.</p><h3> The World&rsquo;s Second-Largest Economy in Flux</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinae28099s-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-onee28099s-talking-about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   commented before  </a> </u>  that China has been moving away from a manufacturing-based economy and instead focusing more on services&mdash;financials, real estate, insurance, ecommerce and the like.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-23/CHN-Chinas-Services-Industry-Surpasses-50-Percent-GDP-10232015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China's Services Industry Surpasses 50 Pecent GDP\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-23/CHN-Chinas-Services-Industry-Surpasses-50-Percent-GDP-10232015.png\"/> </a> <br/> While the country&rsquo;s purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) reading has been in contraction mode since March of this year, these service industries are ever-expanding. The problem is that the transformation has not been fast enough to offset the massive size of the manufacturing sector.</p><p> But investment opportunities in this sector still exist. Anyone who&rsquo;s traveled more than 100 miles inland knows that China is under-urbanized. Ever since Deng Xiaoping created special tax-free zones along the eastern Chinese coastline in 1978, most of the country&rsquo;s growth has been concentrated in these few regions and municipalities. The interior provinces, on the other hand, have remained largely rural.</p><p> You can see this for yourself in the chart below, provided by Marko Papic, chief geopolitical strategist for BCA Research, who briefed our investments team this week. BCA is an influential, independent investment strategy firm with more than 65 years of experience conducting excellent macroeconomic research.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-23/COMM-chinese-interior-provinces-still-need-investment-led-growth-10232015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Chinese Interior Provinces Still Need Investment-Led Growth\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-23/COMM-chinese-interior-provinces-still-need-investment-led-growth-10232015.png\"/> </a> <br/> We just learned that the People&rsquo;s Bank of China cut both lending and saving rates 0.25 percent, to 4.35 percent and 1.50 percent respectively. This will cause negative real rates in China to fall even lower, which is good for gold demand.</p><p> It will also likely add to the Fed&rsquo;s list of doubts about raising its own rates. In a world where every other major country is stimulating its economy by cutting rates and devaluing its currency, it makes less and less sense for the U.S. to hike rates.</p><p> BCA&rsquo;s Marko Papic stressed the need to see further stimulus in China. Without it, commodities and global growth in general are at risk. Some economists believe we might be headed for a global recession.</p><h3> Difference of Opinion When It Comes to Defining Global Recession</h3><p> <br/> Depending on who you ask, there are different ideas of what global recession looks like. The generally accepted one in the U.S. is two consecutive quarterly declines in real GDP. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), however, uses a different measure. Among other economic conditions, annual GDP must fall below 3 percent, a high benchmark and one that requires much stimulus.</p><p> Global growth for 2015 is at 3.3 percent, the IMF calculates, precariously close to the 3 percent threshold. </p><h3> BCA Research: The Trans-Pacific Partnership Is Needed to Fast-Track Global Growth</h3><p> <br/> This is where the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  </a> </u>  comes into play, which is the stance BCA also takes. The landmark trade agreement, involving 12 nations, was signed earlier this month. Although it still requires ratification, the TPP could boost the world economy by an incredible $223 billion by 2025, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><h3> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-23/COMM-the-12-apostles-of-the-historic-trans-pacific-partnership-10092015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The 12 Apostles of the Historic Trans-Pacific Partnership\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-23/COMM-the-12-apostles-of-the-historic-trans-pacific-partnership-10092015.png\"/> </a> <br/> Like Father, Like Son: Canada Elects a New Leader</h3><p> <br/> One of the TPP&rsquo;s biggest supporters was outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. But the newly elected Justin Trudeau, member of the Liberal party, has also come out in support of free trade agreements. The hope is that he will continue to take this position where the TPP is concerned.</p><p> Although Trudeau earned his degree in education from the University of British Columbia and taught as a school teacher for many years, he is by no means a stranger to politics. He&rsquo;s served as a Member of Parliament since 2008, and his father, Pierre Trudeau, served as Canada&rsquo;s prime minister for 15 years.</p><p> Back in the 1970s, in fact, I campaigned for Pierre Trudeau alongside Dr. John Evans, a Rhodes Scholar. This was during Trudeau&rsquo;s first stint in office, before being voted out in 1979 and then returning to serve again in 1984.</p><p> His son, only 43, ran on a campaign of hope and change&mdash;sound familiar?&mdash;and promised that, if elected, he would help the economy by increasing infrastructure spending. Unlike some other world leaders, he wants to put people to work instead of establishing a welfare state. Trudeau plans to raise revenue by taxing recreational marijuana&mdash;if he succeeds at legalizing it, that is.</p><p> One of the main criticisms of Trudeau the Younger is that he&rsquo;s inexperienced politically. But here in the U.S., take a look at who&rsquo;s currently topping the polls in the Republican field: business magnate Donald Trump, neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Accomplished though they are, none of them has been elected to office. This goes to show that voters have grown fed up with career politicians who lack accountability.</p>",

    "link": "tax-loss-harvesting-when-investment-losses-are-a-plus",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Will Holt</p><p> It takes a lot of discipline to stick to an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/lower-stock-market-means-higher-future-returns/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment strategy  </a> </u>  that calls for patience while stock prices are falling. The urge to  do something , to take action, can be overpowering. Unfortunately, average investors more often than not choose the wrong course and end up hurting their long-term results because of decisions based on short-term conditions.</p><p> But a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/6-commandments-investors-market-meltdown/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   down market  </a> </u>  can present opportunities in the form of lower taxes if you know where to look. Selling stocks (or other securities) at a loss can potentially reduce your tax bill. That&rsquo;s because the tax code allows investors to use up to $3,000 in capital losses each year to offset ordinary income, such as from wages and pensions. This is known as tax-loss harvesting, and there are important rules you must follow for it to work.</p><p> First, you should understand the so-called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   wash sale  </a> </u>  rule. This prohibits you from taking a deduction for a loss on a securities sale if you buy &ldquo;substantially identical&rdquo; securities within 30 days before or after the sale. In other words, you can&rsquo;t sell stock at a loss when it&rsquo;s down, turn around and buy back the same stock, and then deduct the loss. You can&rsquo;t avoid the wash sale rule by simply buying the stock in a different account, either.</p><p> However, you can sell one stock at a loss and buy another as long as the replacement is not &ldquo;substantially identical.&rdquo; For instance, you can&rsquo;t take a loss by selling Apple and then buy Apple back &mdash; but you can sell Google at a loss and then buy Apple.</p><p> Just because you are  able  to take a loss doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that you should. The stock might still fit into your long-term investment goals, even at its lower price. There may be a replacement investment that fits equally well &mdash; but if there isn&rsquo;t, you are changing your asset allocation. You run the risk of reducing the effectiveness of your portfolio over time, negating the benefit of taking the loss in the first place.</p><p> You must also consider the &ldquo;tax bracket now versus tax bracket later&rdquo; question. A tax-loss harvesting strategy is most effective when you expect your tax rate to be lower in the future, such as after you  <u>  retire </u>  and your income drops. Additionally, capital losses offset capital gains before they are allowed as a deduction against ordinary income. (Say you have $5,000 in capital losses and $4,000 in capital gains. The first $4,000 of your losses offset the gains, leaving only $1,000 to deduct against ordinary income.) Since capital gains on investments held longer than one year  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/2015-capital-gains-tax-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   aren&rsquo;t taxed at all  </a> </u>  if you&rsquo;re below the 25% tax bracket, taking the loss may wipe out tax-free capital gains.</p><p> There are other complicating factors that have to be weighed depending on your individual circumstances. For a taxpayer in a low tax bracket, taking a loss on depreciated stock may not create any tax benefit at all. However, if you receive  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/tax-planning-social-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Security benefits  </a> </u>  or a health insurance premium subsidy, taking the loss may drastically reduce your  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/ask/topic/taxes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax bill  </a> </u>  because of the way these items are treated in the tax code.</p><p> Tax-loss harvesting can be an effective tool for increasing overall portfolio efficiency if used properly. However it usually requires detailed analysis to make sure you avoid the potential pitfalls buried in complex tax rules. Working with a qualified professional may be necessary to put together a plan for managing the risks. But the next time you have investing losses, perhaps you&rsquo;ll want to consider the possible perks from a tax perspective.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In today&rsquo;s uncertain economy, <strong>  fear continues to affect employees every day </strong> , causing them to act in selfish ways and to lose sight of desired company and team outcomes. In an effort to get employees out of the WIIFM (What&rsquo;s In It For Me) mindset, a leader should start by asking, <strong>  &ldquo;Whom do we treat like gold?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> If the answer is, &ldquo;Our clients,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s correct. However, there&rsquo;s more. <strong>  Why not treat employees and all people like gold? </strong> Amazingly, <strong>  we most often choose to treat people who are not part of our every day lives with greater respect </strong> and consideration than those who are sitting right next to us and on whom we count to get the work done for the clients we want to treat like gold. Why is this?</p><p> I was a consultant for a company that brought three divisions together to form one new division. As might be expected, jousting for position by team members, displays of territorial divisiveness, fears of job-preservation, contempt, and many other not-so-great human attributes were the main concerns of this new group.</p><p> The leader knew she needed to bring the group together quickly to hit revenue and profitability goals.</p><p> Observing the team during a regular staff meeting one day, I sensed that trust was absent from the conversation. No one shared information fully and there was an underlying tone of disrespect in their interactions.</p><p> Near the end of the first quarter, it was obvious the team was in jeopardy of failing to meet its goals. Somewhere along the way, team members had lost perspective regarding their collective purpose and individuals had become quick to sabotage. Clearly, each individual was focused on WIIFM.</p><p> When communication from the top is not clear, when strategy and outcomes are not well defined, people resort to protecting their jobs rather than pursuing team goals. This includes everyone on the team, even the leader.</p><p> So why treat clients like gold yet not your employees? <strong>  How you behave, act, and treat people will be emulated, mirrored and parroted by your people. </strong> Treat them like gold and in turn they will treat each other like gold, creating good team habits that will spill over into taking care of clients. And, thus, treating those clients like gold.</p><p> How can a leader treat employees like gold?</p><li> Actively seek and listen to their ideas.</li><li> Be considerate of clients and employees when they speak.</li><li> Help problem solve.</li><li> Be proactive in communication, preparing for meetings, etc.</li><li> Always put your best foot forward.</li><li> Always go above and beyond.</li><li> Think of the needs of the client/employee first.</li><li> Focus on the best outcome for the client/employee before self-interests. <br/>  </li><p> One simple thing a leader can do to make a difference and support achieving your strategic outcomes and heart-felt desires is to treat members of your teams with the same respect and care you want them to show clients. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, really.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

And to have someone so influential in your industry do this, could mean you get loads of exposure for your own products, services or content to exactly the right audience, recommended by someone who they really look up to.</p><p> There are several ways to go about influencer marketing, here are some ideas:</p><p> Ask for Retweets on twitter by reaching out directly and publicly, this isn&rsquo;t that much of a nuisance to them just make sure the content is relevant and of interest to your target influencer.</p><p> Write a blog post about your influencer or influencers, that is helpful for your reader yet includes a little ego stroking for your target influencer.</p><p> Write or vlog about a recent article your influencer has written and explain why their views are so important for your audience.</p><p> Meet your influencer in real life! &ndash; This may be a little harder but if you go to industry conferences you are likely to bump into that big publication or top journalist in your industry, talk to them, connect and share an image of you together on social media, this is a great way to connect offline and online and then make that social media connection (This happened to me! Deborah Meadon &ndash; Dragons Den &ndash; Has retweeted me! and said i&rsquo;m so good at social media!) &ndash; This can give you and your business and credibility a huge boost.</p><p> Start small and work your way up. Start with your local news outlet or niche publications and when the time is right to reach out to the Richard Branson&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ll know!</p><p> Be resilient, it can take time to get influencers to notice you. Keep posting great content, share your views with influencers and always thank them when they do share your content. Don&rsquo;t be too desperate or overly spammy! This is a one way ticket to getting yourself blocked or called a stalker.</p>",

    "link": "i-bank-therefore-i-nothing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> At first my journey was powered by personal and professional indignation that banks don&rsquo;t spend money on finding out what consumers really feel and giving it to them. Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve realised this is not banks being evil, it&rsquo;s just banks being dumb.</p><p> I now honestly think we should forgive them, for they don&rsquo;t know any better. As an example of this systemic ignorance, following my series on Banks and Brands I&rsquo;ve had a frightful amount of conversations with bankers who still confuse marketing with branding.</p><p> &ldquo;Yes, our marketing department is not doing a great job with this brand thing, our ads are never great.&rdquo; &ndash; While there&rsquo;s no dispute that most banks&rsquo; marketing is subpar and underwhelming, this is a minute part of the brand and certainly NOT the job of the marketing department! It&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s job.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Reputation is what people say about you when you&rsquo;re not in the room&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Seen that adage? The easiest way to explain brand is to extrapolate that to say <strong>  &ldquo;Brand is what people feel about your company when they don&rsquo;t even think about it&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Without this core understanding of what a brand really is, I don&rsquo;t believe banks will ever be able to deliver compelling user experience, understand what human centred design truly entails and remember their &ldquo;we do want to serve the consumer&rdquo; demagogical mission statements enough to transform it into reality.</p><p> <strong>  Falling in Brand </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.&rdquo; &ndash; Maya Angelou </p><p> Studying how consumers emotionally respond to brands is not nearly as advanced as it could be. This is because the definition of brands has been evolving as the way we experience them has with the advent of the digital channels. The best brands transcend the channel and give us an unitary (pleasurable) impression in all of them equally, whether in person or digitally. If you&rsquo;re an Uber fan (the &ldquo;if&rdquo; stems from their latest degradation in London) you&rsquo;ll feel strongly positively about the overall experience without even being able to separate the value as coming from the ease of payment or the drive in itself.</p><p> Research does show we have the same emotional response to developing a relationship with a brand that we do when embarking on a new relationship with a person. In other words we fall in love the same way with brands as we do with people.</p><p> There may not be as clear of passionate moments of &ldquo;wow&rdquo; which we presume are impossible to replicate elsewhere from how that brand intimately understands our very core and we may not go to sleep and wake up thinking of it but  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3051009/our-brains-trust-brands-the-same-way-we-trust-our-friends\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we trust brands with the same mechanisms that we trust people  </a> </u>  and more importantly, on a smaller scale, we experience the same sense of content belonging while it lasts and a sense of loss when disenchanted. The key reason why it&rsquo;s on a smaller scale is because of how with this form of attachment as compared to relationships, there&rsquo;s acceptance and active encouragement around mobility. The expectations that we would discover something new and move on is, after all, the essence of commerce.</p><p> In banking this expectation of mobility does not exist and it&rsquo;s worth considering what this means for the relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Brands work hard to become and remain part of the fabric of who we are &ndash; banks couldn&rsquo;t be further from doing any of that work yet we don&rsquo;t leave. </strong></p><p> This is worth repeating over and over: truly valuable brand experiences are addictive and sticky  but most importantly, they become part of the customer&rsquo;s own narrative and identity &ndash; who we wear, what we listen to, what we we watch are all points of self actualisation and pride &ndash; yet there&rsquo;s never any pride in who we bank with.</p><p> We use brand association as a means of communicating things about us that would be otherwise borderline socially unacceptable to communicate in an adult or professional setting. Kids will walk up to each other on the playground, wave awkwardly and machine gun at 100 words per hour &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Kate &ndash; I like pink and Frozen and lollies and sunny days and singing and skipping and I have a pet hamster named Bubbles and my mommy has a thousand shoes and I have Dora the Explorer PJs and like Fruit Shoot. You?&rdquo;. And they will get a response. This becomes less and less of an acceptable communication method as we advance through life (unless you live in Shoreditch) so to replace it we wear a certain colour (or if you&rsquo;re in Financial Services a certain type of kooky socks at conferences) and drive a certain car, we drink a certain make and choose a certain newspaper or TV channel.</p><p> There is, of course, a difference between someone driving a Mercedes a and someone choosing to drive a Mercedes and then expressing it. &ldquo;I drive a Mercedes&rdquo; is a statement to mean they&rsquo;ve chosen it, that there is something about the values it represents that they subscribe to &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s the process of making it, its appearance, its technical prowess or its country of origin that the driver admires, the statement says parts of that and implies they are proud to be associated with it.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Meh, it is what it is, brand happens!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> We&rsquo;ll hear what people drive, what they wear and what they drink every day. Never who they bank with.</p><p> &ldquo;I bank with Lloyds&rdquo; should say so much about someone. It should say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m conservative in nature and careful with my money (yet not as far backwards as to be with the biggest bank in the world) and like my bank to give me some digital convenience (yet I don&rsquo;t appreciate the SciFi pie charts or the all-black browser experiences and don&rsquo;t mind the maddeningly tedious password entry experience), I like how they occasionally try and keep up with the times (yet don&rsquo;t want them to be trying too hard and give me doggy treats or video banking for mortgages) I like that I can send money to my spouse (but don&rsquo;t care how much it costs or how painless it is to do so) and hey, I may even like green.&rdquo; &ndash; If Lloyds were a brand, customers would say it, be proud of it and expect it to mean something.</p><p> When the CheBanca team thinks of vision, direction and translates that into product they intently drive what capital they are building in their brand in person and online. It&rsquo;s beyond creating users personas and sticking them on the walls, it&rsquo;s carving a sense of emotional investment with every gesture and every choice of colour and then sustaining that with service and interaction. They are inserting themselves into the fabric of who their consumers are and want to be. How do I know this? I don&rsquo;t. I never sat down with them or witnessed this but but I&rsquo;m willing to bet my last Euro that they don&rsquo;t expect any of the narrative around what it means to bank with them to just happen and pay it no mind, or they would not have built a brand beloved by Italians above the likes of Nike or Starbucks.</p><p> Brand does happen, but addictive, beloved brand doesn&rsquo;t. It takes work and it takes passion so if we have any of those left in banking at the end of a day debating acronyms and technology let&rsquo;s invest them into the consumer&rsquo;s Emotional Current Account by building something he can be proud being part of.</p> ",

We&rsquo;ve been taught to consider this kind of information strictly personal, and that it is crass to discuss such things outside the home. However, while it can be in poor taste to brag or be nosy about money, people do need to be able to discuss financial matters openly in appropriate contexts &ndash;and I think we&rsquo;d agree that the office of your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   divorce financial advisor  </a> </u>  is definitely an appropriate context! Yet, over the years I&rsquo;ve been helping women navigate financially complex divorces, I&rsquo;ve found that many women are just not comfortable with those conversations. <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fidelity Investments  </a> </u>  has an obvious interest in helping people talk about their money, and to learn more about women and their finances, the firm recently conducted some research.

The most common reason cited was &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too personal&rdquo; (56%), followed by &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want those I&rsquo;m close with to know this information&rdquo; (35%), &ldquo;it&rsquo;s uncomfortable&rdquo; (32%), and &ldquo;I was raised not to talk about finances&rdquo; (27%).</li><li> Only 47% say they would be confident discussing money and investing with a financial professional on their own. (By contrast, 77% would discuss medical issues with a doctor on their own.)</li><li> While 82% are confident managing day-to-day budgeting, their confidence slips when it comes to longer term financial planning. Of those surveyed, 62% are confused about navigating their future financial path.</li>These findings trouble me for several reasons. First and foremost, women need to be as readily knowledgeable and easily conversant in financial matters as men are. When they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re more likely to be taken advantage of at work, in making major purchases and investments, and certainly in divorce.If you need to increase your comfort level for discussing money, try these strategies:<h3> <strong>  Hit the books.    </strong></h3>There are many excellent resources for women who want to learn more about their finances. If the topic makes you anxious, become educated at your own pace, in a comfortable setting. Are you an independent learner? Get started on the internet, or in your local library. Does the idea of a formal course of study appeal to you? Check into classes at your local community college.Information is available about every level of investing, real estate, debt management, taxes, and of course, <u> <a href=\"http://www.thinkfinancially.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  securing your financial future before, during and after divorce </a></u>. Choose reputable sources, and steer clear of sales pitches disguised as general information.&ldquo;Women should feel empowered, not overwhelmed by finances,&rdquo; Rebecca Wiggins, Executive Director of <u> <a href=\"https://www.afcpe.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AFCPE&reg; </a></u>, told me. &ldquo;There are many tools and resources available to help educate women about their finances, from websites like <u> <a href=\"http://www.nefe.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  NEFE&rsquo;s Smart About Money </a></u> and budget programs like <u> <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mint </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.youneedabudget.com/?gclid=CODPgOCInMQCFUY8gQodboAABQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  YNAB </a></u> to workshops and courses taught at a community center, college, or YWCA.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t expect to become an expert overnight.  </strong></h3>Now that you&rsquo;ve taken a look at what&rsquo;s available to help you learn about money, the trick is not to become overwhelmed. If you&rsquo;re paralyzed by the sheer volume of information out there, take a deep breath and a step back! Just commit to both broadening your knowledge over time, and resisting the tendency to be embarrassed at what you don&rsquo;t know yet.<h3> <strong>  Practice. </strong></h3>Like many things, talking about money gets more comfortable the more you do it. Start by simply including financial topics in your conversation. For example, after this year&rsquo;s Academy Awards ceremony, people were abuzz about <a href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/02/22/patricia-arquette-steals-oscars-with-rousing-speech-calling-for-equal-pay-in-nation-hollywood/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Patricia Arquette&rsquo;s acceptance speech</a>. Her remarks make a perfect springboard for a discussion about wage inequality, which could lead to sharing strategies for asking for a raise at work, a conversation about 401(k) plans, etc.Subscribing to a financial magazine is an excellent way to practice discussing money matters. There are financial aspects to all current events and trendy topics, and you might find these angles unexpectedly interesting.Financial matters are part of our lives. It needn&rsquo;t be awkward to discuss them, and you can do it without sharing personal details socially.<h3> <strong>  Sit down with a professional. </strong></h3>You will need to share details with professional experts, though. Whatever your circumstances, there are specialists whose job it is to help you. It is an excellent idea to enlist professional guidance to help you manage your financial portfolio. Rebecca Wiggins agrees. &ldquo;Oftentimes it helps to meet with a professional,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<u> Accredited Financial Counselors (AFC&reg;)</u> provide unbiased guidance to help clients work through financial challenges, identify financial opportunities, and develop successful strategies for achieving long term goals.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Keep money in perspective. </strong></h3>Remember that your net worth doesn&rsquo;t represent your value as a person. Money is definitely important &ndash; it gives us security, as well as some of the material things we want in life &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t define us.When you distance your identity and emotions from your money, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s easier to discuss it as you would anything else. In fact, any &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; about discussing financial matters, especially in general terms, can begin to seem silly.The Fidelity study also reports some positives. For example, the overwhelming majority of women surveyed say they want to get more involved in their finances. That&rsquo;s excellent news. When women commit to improving their <u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/03/06/financial-literacy-the-key-to-every-womans-financial-stability/\" target=\"_blank\">  financial literacy </a></u>, the effects go far beyond what they learn about money. Often, it makes for significant improvement in their relationships, as well.Talking openly about money with your husband, preferably beginning before you are married, will strengthen your partnership. Share your short- and long-term goals, discuss investment risks, and find strategies to meet those goals together. You&rsquo;ll be building on a foundation of communication and mutual respect.Whether you choose to be or not, statistics show that, as a woman, you&rsquo;ll likely be in sole control of your finances at some point in your life. Though you may not divorce, odds are that you&rsquo;ll outlive your husband. Being comfortable talking about money means you&rsquo;re better prepared to manage your financial affairs as a single woman, from your spending plan to your retirement plan.&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s society, women wear more hats than ever before &ndash; they often balance motherhood, successful careers, and still manage the household. Creating a spending plan can feel overwhelming, but it&rsquo;s an important step in building a strong financial foundation and instilling lifelong lessons in future generations,&rdquo; Wiggins concluded.###<strong> Reminder: </strong>Discussing money isn&rsquo;t necessarily rude. You don&rsquo;t have to broadcast information you&rsquo;d prefer to keep private, and you don&rsquo;t have to fish for details of your friends&rsquo; financial lives.<strong> Legal matters: </strong>Being able to discuss money in a straightforward way can save lots of time in your lawyer&rsquo;s office&hellip; and, since every minute of that time gets billed to you, this is one situation in which talking frankly about money will actually save you money!<strong> Hot tip: </strong>It might help to consider that talking about money is no different than, say, discussing your plans to build a house, for example. There are settings in which it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to get much into it &ndash;you wouldn&rsquo;t bog down a social conversation with specifics about the pitch of the roof and the composition of the mortar &ndash;but in your architect&rsquo;s office, you wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to delve into the details.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Being able to understand client needs </strong>  is arguably one of the most important aspect of sales &ndash; unless you uncover a need (desire, one, hope, ambition) with a potential client, no sale will move forward. There are entire books that have been written about how to better understand client needs &ndash; simply Googling the term returns 186,000,000 results.</p><p> And our research at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/?__hstc=74853325.91aafdd5569101a528b140c93cfba240.1444771367850.1446057091283.1446062177188.4&amp;__hssc=74853325.1.1446062177188&amp;__hsfp=3676588223\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RAIN Group  </a> </u>  has clearly shown that buyers buy from sellers who understand their needs. Looking at the differences between the winners and the second-place finishers, &ldquo;understood my needs&rdquo; was the fifth largest gap .</p><p> In fact, the winners demonstrated they understood the buyer&rsquo;s needs 2.5 times more often than the second-place finishers. On top of that, of the 42 factors, buyers said &ldquo;understood my needs&rdquo; was the fifth most important factor that second-place finishers should change in order to win their business.</p><p> But there is another, more subtle finding in the research: the ability to understand client needs is more important than the ability to diagnose needs. In other words, it&rsquo;s not so much about providing an accurate diagnosis of &ldquo;the problem&rdquo; as it is about making your buyers feel understood.</p><p> People have a natural tendency to feel comfortable, positive and valued around others who understand them. In fact, your ability to make others feel like you understand has impacts many levels of the relationship.</p><p> Academic research  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652476/\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;On Feeling Understood and Feeling Well: The Role of Interdependence&rdquo;  </a> </u>  reported that:</p><p>   &ldquo;People enjoy social environments where they feel understood by others. According to self-verification theory, people prefer to interact with others who confirm their self-views, even when those views are negative (see  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652476/#R17\" target=\"_blank\">   Swann, Rentfrow, &amp; Guinn, 2003  </a> </u>  for a review). People also feel more satisfied and stay in relationships longer when they and their partners have similar affective responses to life events ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652476/#R1\" target=\"_blank\">   Anderson, Keltner, &amp; John, 2003  </a> </u> ;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652476/#R12\" target=\"_blank\">   Oishi &amp; Sullivan, 2006  </a> </u> ) or similar interpersonal goals ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652476/#R15\" target=\"_blank\">   Sanderson &amp; Evans, 2001  </a> </u> ). These findings imply that people seek and enjoy social interactions with others who understand their subjective thoughts and feelings. This collection of research also presents an emerging perspective that feeling understood or misunderstood is an integral experience of our social lives.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, your ability to understand others (or at least make it feel like to understand them) helps not only your ability to uncover needs that you can resolve, but in fact helps you build and cement the relationship itself.</p><p> Really making people feel like you understand them &ndash; in truth &ndash; isn&rsquo;t all that complex. It&rsquo;s about taking some common advice in sales to heart, and executing on the basics. In fact, over time I have developed a simple five-step process that is designed explicitly to help others feel like you understand them &ndash; like a truly &ldquo;get them&rdquo;.</p><h3> 1. Ask insightful questions </h3><p> <br/> The first step in the process to better understand client needs is to  <u>  ask insightful questions </u> . Doing things like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-amazingly-good-asking-questions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not asking yes/no questions  </a> </u> , digging deeper and using the power silence are all important parts of the question process</p><h3> 2. Listen carefully</h3><p> <br/> The second step is to listen carefully, by which I mean listening without looking for clues to turn around the conversation and start to talk about your products or services. When you listen carefully, don&rsquo;t interrupt and simply absorb what you&rsquo;re hearing, you&rsquo;re sending a subtle message: I care about you, and I care about your views.</p><h3> 3. Play back &amp; paraphrase</h3><p> <br/> Playing back and paraphrasing are two important ways of confirming whether you&rsquo;ve understood what the other person was trying to say. But the true value goes well beyond that: by playing their awards back to them, you confirm to the other person that you you&rsquo;re not only listening, but &ndash; quite literally &ndash; understood what they were trying to say.</p><h3> 4. Listen for more</h3><p> <br/> Almost always, when you play back and paraphrase, two things will start to happen. First, the person will correct your views in some way, and attempt to explain what they were trying to say in the first place. Second, they will often offer up additional information that builds on what they initially said.</p><h3> 5. Confirm your understanding</h3><p> <br/> Often overlooked, the simple act of confirming that you understand now fully what they were trying to say is the final step in the process. By doing this you reassure them that you have a full understanding of their needs, and show them the respect and attention they deserve.</p><p> In spite of the volumes of research, books and blog posts (like this one &hellip;) dedicated to how to better understand client needs, in the end the simple five-step process above will get you where you want to be: in a place where your buyer feels like you truly, really understood what they were trying to say.</p><p> And remember this: of the 42 factors investigated, buyers said &ldquo;understood my needs&rdquo; was the fifth most important thing sellers need to do that in order to win their business &ndash; now and in the future.</p>",

    "link": "pitching-the-c-suite",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> <strong>  CEOs are people, too </strong></h3><p> <br/> Very often I get the question how one should best develop business with the C-Suite. While there might be some nuances in the way we approach high level executives, the fundamentals are still the same. It's especially important to understand that these people are also human. They appreciate courtesy, thoughtfulness and they also want to hear stories.</p><p> When we sell in a consultative environment, no matter who we sell to, listening is more important than talking. Yes, we need messaging and a pitch and we need to communicate with our prospects, but it's how we do it that is essential to success. When it comes to selling to the C-Suite we probably need to prepare and research even more because we are targeting people who have a clear business goal in mind.</p><h3> <strong>  Be goal oriented </strong></h3><p> <br/> C-level people are not interested in the features or benefits of your service/product, there only goal is to drive the business forward. CEOs are the heart of every organization, so their goal is to find ways to do better business. They will most likely delegate you to one of their direct reports (if they are smart) but it's always good to reach out to them first, because once you get a recommendation from the very top, your sales cycle will be shorter.</p><p> Imagine a call that gets transferred from the CEOs office? Or, you being able to reference the CEOs name when having a conversation with a decision maker. I can tell you from my own experience that it does wonders.</p><h3> <strong>  Tie your message to their business goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is a reason why people are where they are. C-level people are driven and measured by success. They don't have a lot of time on their hand and they are often used to being praised. Therefore, it is really important to do solid research, on the company and on the person. You will gain the respect of a CEO if you know your facts and if you get to the point quickly. These are people who are used to making decisions on a daily basis. They usually act quickly and they want to see results. If you can tie your value proposition to their business goals, you will get their attention.</p><h3> <strong>  Be respectful but not afraid </strong></h3><p> <br/> This goes without saying, we should always be respectful in a prospecting/sales situation, but when selling to the C-Suite it's important that we are mindful of their time while not being afraid. CEOs might have big egos that need to be tended to, but they really appreciate if you can help them move their business forward. They live and breathe business, that's why they are at the top. Personally, I have had many rewarding and lengthy conversations with CEOs who have helped me pave the way to a decision maker. Why? Because I had a compelling story to tell.</p><p> Just recently I had an experience with a logistics firm that I had been prospecting for over 18 months. My goal was to clearly communicate how our approach to sales training can help them shorten the sales cycle. While my emails were opened there was no response until four months ago. Then everything happened very quickly. The training manager reached out to us, referencing my outreach to their CEO and we closed the project a month later.</p><h3> <strong>  Stay with them </strong></h3><p> <br/> Which brings me to the fact that you need to stay with them. C-Level people might not respond as quickly as people who report to them. You need to keep communicating to them (in my case for 18 months). They are busier than most people, they get inundated with information every single day. You will need to find ways to break through to them, so your message stands out (again drafting a clear business objective), but once you get their attention you will be able to shorten your sales cycle if you have done your homework.</p><h3> <strong>  Work with assistants </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many C-level people these days answer their own emails, and sometimes even their phones but there is still a large group that relies on assistants. These people hold the key to the kingdom when it comes to communicating with their bosses. Good assistants decide who will get time with their boss, and who will be blocked. They are either a blessing or a curse depending on how well you can connect with them. Always address them with their name, make them feel important (because they are) and treat them with the same level of respect you would treat any other person within the organization.</p><h3> <strong>  Act normal </strong></h3><p> <br/> Last, but not least - keep in mind that C-Level people are humans, too. They have worries, problems, families, desires and needs. Be yourself when talking to them. Don't treat them like a strange entity, that's when they start feeling that you are trying to sell them something. If you have a clear value proposition on how to help their business, they will listen. It's in their best interest to find solutions that help their company grow and prosper.</p><p> Start at the top, it will pay off. Good luck!</p>",

    "content": "<p> When we awaken to our truth we realize we are free (Kristi Bowman).</p><h3> What is our truth? Sometimes it's hard to find because we are easily influenced by external sources. We hear a good idea and think, I will do that too! And we excitedly start down the course. We muster up our courage and we take swift action. And then - nothing happens. What we were hoping for doesn't materialize. We don't get what we wanted. We feel disconnected from people. It's harder than it should be, or takes longer than we thought it would. We feel isolated and alone.</h3><p> <br/> Then the negative self-talk kicks in. \"What was I thinking?\" \"Why did I think I could pull that off anyway?\" \"No one understands me.\" \"No one wants what I have to offer.\" &lt;Insert your version of negative self-talk here.&gt;</p><p> We become filled with uncertainty, doubt, and fear and we are unable to act. We get stuck, we stall, we freeze.</p><p> And then one day, we step far enough away from the situation to look at it with objective eyes. Then we see what's really going on. We realize: \"Wait, this isn't what I wanted at all.\" In some cases, we discover that the path we pursued is actually opposite of what we really wanted to begin with, had we just taken a moment in the beginning to consider that. Perhaps the path we followed doesn't align to our deeply held beliefs or our innermost core values. Or maybe we neglected our deeply held talents and gifts and tried to do something that we didn't love.</p><p> And this new awareness comes not from harsh negative self-talk, but from a more gentle and understanding place. This new awareness is presented to us in a more loving and compassionate tone, because it comes from our heart.</p><p> We approach this new awareness with curiosity and openness. We can then say to our self with honesty, grace, and self-compassion: \"That way may work GREAT for that person. But it doesn't work great for me.\"  We let go of what's not working. We reframe what it means to \"fail\" and realize that every situation we encounter - every single one - is an opportunity for learning. Every situation brings with it a lesson and we just need to open up and give it space to emerge. When we are ready, the lesson becomes clear. And then we can choose a new path.</p><p> Our heart is wise and knows what it is that we truly want. Our heart approaches everything with light and love and joy. Our mind, on the other hand, swirls around our fears and doubts. Too often, we allow fear to run our life. When we choose fear over love, we dim our inner light. </p><p> When we follow our heart, we know our innermost desires. When we follow our heart, we radiate light, love and joy. When we follow our heart, we tell the Universe that we are open to possibilities and are ready to receive the synchronicity and miracles that are just waiting for us to be ready. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VHLawGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chad Van Horn  </a> </u>  |  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.vanhornlawgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Van Horn Law Group  </a> </u></p><p> You already know how important online reputation management is to keeping your business afloat; a Berkeley study  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/the-top-3-ways-restaurants-can-raise-their-yelp-rating-2897105\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reported by LA Weekly  </a> </u>  shows that a rating increase of one star (out of a five star rating) can offer an increase in revenue close to 10 percent. <strong>  Likewise, the other side of the coin could spell absolute disaster for your business through a decrease in sales and a loss of trust among current and prospective clients. </strong></p><p> Thankfully, there are ways to fight back when the reviews in question are libelous or defamatory. Remember that only false statements are considered defamation; even the most vitriolic negative review is not by legal definition defamatory, and generally cannot be disputed except through dialogue with the commenter in question. </p><p> There are three steps to getting false online reviews removed.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Respond to the Review </strong></h3><p> <br/> This may seem counterproductive at first, especially if you&rsquo;re 99 percent certain that the review is false, but this is a necessary first step. This shows other web browsers, customers and clients that you&rsquo;re addressing the issue, helping to mitigate the damage done by the defamatory statement.</p><p> Your response should feature:</p><li> <strong>  A request for clarification on the issue at hand; you can also offer a short, simple apology. </strong></li><li> <strong>  If necessary, a statement that you and your business have no record or report of the event(s) mentioned in the review. </strong></li><li> <strong>  An invitation to contact your business via phone or email, with the number and email included in the body of the reply. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> If you already have a standard or canned response for negative reviews, you should be able to modify it slightly for your needs with this issue. Here&rsquo;s an example of a simple response to a false and defamatory review:</p><p> &ldquo;Thank you for contacting Van Horn Law Group. Unfortunately, we have no record of the issue you&rsquo;ve described and can&rsquo;t find your name in our client database. Please contact us as soon as possible at (954) 765-3166 or info@cvhlawgroup.com as soon as possible; we&rsquo;d love to address this problem directly. Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p> You should be prepared to wait a few days for a response, but there&rsquo;s no reason to wait until that response comes in (if indeed it ever does) to move forward with the process of getting the review removed.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Establish Whether the Reviewer is Genuine </strong></h3><p> <br/> While you&rsquo;re waiting for your unhappy customer (or non-customer) to get back to you, it&rsquo;s time to do a little digging. Most people won&rsquo;t post defamatory reviews under their own name, instead opting for a pseudonym; you may even find similar negative reviews posted by different people over the course of days, weeks or even months. Chances are this is all one person working hard to bring your company down.</p><p> While it&rsquo;s easy for you to tell when someone has left a false review, it&rsquo;s little harder to tell whether or not the person in question is genuine after all. </p><p> Here are a few red flags to watch out for:</p><li> <strong>  The only review under the account is to your business </strong> , or the account has posted one negative review for your business and a positive review for a competitor or other local business.</li><li> <strong>  Conversely, the account may be responsible for dozens of reviews </strong> that are all more or less the same.</li><li> <strong>  The account uses stock photography for icons </strong> , headers, et cetera.</li><li> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://consumerist.com/2010/04/14/how-you-spot-fake-online-reviews/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    The Consumerist notes   </a>  </u> </strong>  that normal people don&rsquo;t write in &ldquo;marketing speak,&rdquo; so keep an eye out for repetition of brand names, use of keywords or references to statistical data.</li><li> <strong>  The account was created the same day the negative review was posted </strong> , or quite recently before.</li><li> <strong>  The name listed is either something generic and difficult to research </strong> or only includes a single name, such as &ldquo;Jane Smith&rdquo; or just &ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  The account features no activity </strong> after the review was posted.</li><li> <strong>  The reviewer never replies to your request for more information </strong> . <br/>  </li><p> If you get another obviously false complaint after posting the response to the first one, you either have a troll or a saboteur on your hands, and it&rsquo;s time to move on to the next step of the process.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Get Legal Counsel </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your company&rsquo;s reputation is the lifeblood of your business, meaning you can&rsquo;t afford to let it be tarnished by someone with a chip on their shoulder. If more than 48 hours pass without a response from the fraudulent reviewer or more false negative reviews start coming in, contact a lawyer as soon as possible. Make sure you have screenshots and links to all the reviews to present to your legal counsel as documentation of your defamation claim, including timestamps and copies of the reviewers&rsquo; accounts. If they used stock photography, you can also run a reverse image search to try to locate the original images and include the sources along with your other documentation. This will add support and serves as an obvious red flag regarding the legitimacy of the reviewer.</p><p> If you have an idea of who may be behind the reviews, simple enough if the majority of fake reviewers also posted comments to one or two local businesses, make sure to include that information as well.</p><p> Your lawyer will review all the information you have and get to work seeking reparations on your behalf. There are a few steps that you can take on your own, but if you&rsquo;ve been targeted directly it&rsquo;s not recommended that you make any move to have the reviews removed right away. The process is difficult, anyway; Google has a  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?rd=1/troubleshooter/1114905\" target=\"_blank\">   content removal request tool  </a> </u> , but this is unlikely to get you very far. However, if your legal professional recommends requesting the review be removed before you take legal action, you can flag the review(s) as inappropriate and see if Google responds to the request. If not, it may be time to move forward with a lawsuit.</p><p> Recovering from defamation can be a long, difficult process. If you feel it's time to take the next step and get the guidance from an attorney,  <u>  Van Horn Law Group </u>  has the resources and experience to help you. </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> One of the biggest mistakes we can make is to assume that our sensual experience of the world is all that exists. Our five senses can often steer us wrong. In the natural world of our senses, a rock is a rock; a desk, a desk, skin, skin. Yet that rock you pick up and feel on your skin and place on the desk is 99.9% empty space&mdash;the space between its atoms; and so is your skin and the desk.</p><p> One of the greatest fears many humans possess is the fear of death. This fear arises from several areas. All fears originate in the primitive segments of our brain, what I have labeled the automatic brain or AB. It is primitive because it is purely reactive, activated by anything its neurons detect as potential danger, threat, or vulnerability. The reflex it causes is fight-or-flight. The only way our AB is different from animals, reptiles, or even lowly insects is that our frontal cortex is more evolved so that our dangers can occur in the form of thought, from stored memories and projections into the future.</p><p> One of the universal, innate &ldquo;dangers&rdquo; that the AB detects is the unknown. And naturally death is a very big unknown. Sure, many profess great belief and faith in an afterlife, but in our quietest moments, when all alone, our AB takes hold and, hence, doubt often sets in. Because, really, the idea of an afterlife flies in the face of logic and evidence derived from our senses.</p><h3> So, if our life now is all that there is, well, that can be a bit scary when we think about it too much. The fear of death is the result of our AB causing us to fight or flee the thought or idea of the unknown of death. In essence, that is my definition of fear&mdash;the manifestation of the fight-or-flight response.</h3><p> <br/> However, remember our biggest mistake from the paragraph above? We view death from the vantage point of life. If you ask many people what their greatest fear is about death, it is being buried alive in a box for eternity. Or perhaps traveling in nothingness trying to escape their dead body. It is an extreme sense of restlessness. In hospitals, some patients require the use of a breathing machine when in critical condition. If this machine can&rsquo;t do its job, those people will surely not recover. Although not used that much anymore, when I was in training, we often used a paralyzing agent so that patients would not resist this machine, by kicking and jerking their bodies because of mental confusion. For if the tube came out they would risk further injury. When they recovered, I often discussed with them their experience. Some remembered, some didn&rsquo;t. Those who did described a tortuous experience&mdash;a tube down their throat, people around, yet they were unable to move. They felt like jumping out of their skin, but couldn&rsquo;t even lift a finger. This type of feeling is similar to what many have described to me as their fear of death&mdash;being dead, but still alive.</p><p> We must understand that viewing death through the eyes of the living is impossible. As our feeble brains cannot perceive nothingness, or infinity for that matter, how can we make a determination, one way or another? And one more thing&mdash;if our experience of the natural, &ldquo;real&rdquo;, world comes from our five senses, but those senses can detect only an infinitesimal fraction of the real structure of things, perhaps our perception of a supernatural divinity, God, is a real possibility (it is for me). A simple tweak in perception can open up a power, strength, and faith that we represent something much larger than ourselves and are destined to continue on, even after the death of our physical body; in a way incompatible with our current life view, yet in a way that we need not fear.  </p>",

We find that a notebook is best &hellip; and leave the highlighter at your desk.</p><h3> Structure your meeting</h3><p> <br/> When creating the meeting agenda &ndash; and you always need an agenda &ndash; make sure you include an objective. To create the most specific objective, fill in the blank: &ldquo;The desired outcome of this meeting is for attendees to_______.&rdquo; Begin the meeting by sharing this objective with everyone and then proceed with the most pressing issues first.</p><h3> Define the action items</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s your meeting to close, and people like a strong close. Summarize key takeaways and action items that you discussed. If people leave the meeting with a sense of purpose, then you have done your job as a meeting chair. Gather meeting notes from the notetaker, and let everyone know they&rsquo;ll be receiving a written record of everything that was discussed.</p><p> Finally, be respectful and finish your meeting on time. If you must run a few minutes over, give others who need to go the opportunity to leave before you carry on.</p><p> If you must run a few minutes over, give others who need to go the opportunity to leave before you carry on.</p><h3> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re attending a meeting today </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Prepare (everyone needs to!)</h3><p> <br/> Being on time is obvious, as is bringing associated meeting materials. To make the most of the time spent in your meeting, it&rsquo;s best to be familiar with the meeting materials and to be ready to update your colleagues on relevant developments from your area(s) of work.</p><h3> Support the host&rsquo;s goals</h3><p> <br/> To help the meeting organizer keep to the agenda (and end the meeting on time), stay focused on the topics being discussed and contribute to the discussion. Be ready to make decisions and help move your project forward when required.</p><p> Be ready to make decisions and help move your project forward when required.</p><h3> Pay close attention</h3><p> <br/> Meetings can be great opportunities to learn about new trends and initiatives in your industry or your organization. Even in a routine meeting, contributing to a culture of respect and attention is a valuable trait that gets noticed and appreciated. Listen, ask questions, take notes and, above all, ignore your smartphone.</p><p> Use these tips to take the lead at your next meeting &hellip; and don&rsquo;t forget your pen!</p>",

A few ideas:</p><h3> 1. Connect with what you initially enjoyed about the work. </h3><p> Was it interacting with people? Seeing projects through to completion? Leading activities? Identify what you've lost touch with so you can determine how to invite it back in.</p><h3> 2. Connect with your 'why' - your purpose.</h3><p> Why does your work matter? How are you impacting others? I guarantee you are; spend some time discerning how - and perhaps how you can connect with that even more deeply.</p><h3> 3. Connect with your time.</h3><p> Get a handle on your schedule, priorities, and what matters most, so you can run your day instead of your day running you. If you're  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/Spark2015.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  coming to Spark </a>  in a few weeks, you'll gain a fantastic system for making this happen every single day.</p><p> <strong>  In a word, connect. </strong> With your passion, your purpose, your time - and others.

There are also required education and work experience qualifications.  The CFA&reg; designation is a highly regarded measure for investment professionals and CFA&reg; charter holders have one of the highest degrees of portfolio and investment analysis expertise.<strong> Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC&reg;):</strong>The ChFC&reg; is an advanced financial planning program administered through the <u> <a href=\"https://www.theamericancollege.edu/designations-degrees/ChFC-CFP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  American College of Financial Services </a></u>. The curriculum consists of nine or more collegiate-level courses focused on various topics of financial planning.  The charter holder gains a multitude of knowledge in various financial planning disciplines ranging from taxation issues, savings, financial management and retirement planning.  The completion of certain parts of the ChFC&reg; course work can work towards meeting the necessary requirements of eligibility to take the Certified Financial Planner (CFP&reg;) exam.<strong> Certified Financial Planner (CFP&reg;):</strong>The CFP&reg; certification is thought of as the pinnacle one can achieve in the financial planning profession and is administered by the <u> <a href=\"http://www.cfp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CFP Board </a></u>.  An individual who has obtained the CFP&reg; certification has completed extensive training and has a wide array of expert knowledge related to the various elements of financial planning.

Most salespeople constantly hear the word \"no\" and often deal with people who, frankly, would rather not be talking to them.</p><p> Succeeding in this position requires certain  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/13-qualities-to-look-for-in-your-next-sales-hire.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   personality traits  </a> </u>  that not everyone has. Here are five of the most critical traits any  <u>  salespeople need for success </u> :</p><h3> <strong>  The need to Achieve </strong></h3><p> <br/> At the end of the workday, some people need to feel a sense of accomplishment while others can't get out the door fast enough. You need the former to be effective. Be someone who cares about performance, watches metrics, always knows where they stand and who habitually searches for ways to improve.</p><h3> <strong>  Competitive Spirit </strong></h3><p> <br/> A competitive spirit drives a person to try creating more leads than the person sitting next to them. If you imagine an entire sales department full of good reps who are all trying to outdo each other, it's is easy to see how a competitive spirit can increase sales.</p><h3> <strong>  Self-Motivation </strong></h3><p> <br/> Selling can be demanding, and the motivation to continue must come from within. You can't flog or threaten your way to better employee performance. You have to enjoy what you do and want to succeed for your own reasons.</p><h3> <strong>  Problem Solvers </strong></h3><p> <br/> Good problem-solvers overcome challenges rather than becoming frustrated by them. Try to be a problem ninja, agile enough to sneak up on problems and eliminate them before issues occur. Success comes from working through problems and helping customers overcome purchase obstacles.</p><h3> <strong>  Optimism </strong></h3><p> <br/> You need to see the glass as half full, even after a particularly rancorous potential lead has spilled it. Rejection comes with the territory, and must be shaken off. Move on to the next call with a positive attitude. Those who take rejection personally don't last long in a sales environment. When you find a person with all of these qualities, you have arrived. Together, these five traits make for a tenacious, effective and successful salesperson.</p>",

One of the most difficult hurdles to jump in digital marketing is calculating a clear ROI, a reason why financial service organizations have been slowly shifting their efforts to digital marketing.</p><p> <strong>  A key part of your digital campaign strategy is building your brand. </strong>  Developing this strategy to deliver clear ROI doesn&rsquo;t stop at graphic design and style guides. Connect with your customers and drive brand advocacy and consistent engagement with your voice through blogs, eBooks, and other messaging outlets while promoting through your social channels to boost sharing and viewership.</p><p> <strong>  Develop a content strategy for your website: </strong>  strategize blog series and thought leadership based on industry trends and predictions. Solidifying your company as an industry expert and trailblazer gives you a broader reach through social sharing and also creates opportunities for features with larger outlets and platforms: Conferences and events, research, and more.</p><p> <strong>  Measure your strategies&rsquo; success. </strong>  A content strategy is only as strong as the goals driving it. With every content or social campaign executed, there needs to be a scale of success in place. For example:</p><li> <strong>  What are you lead/target goals for this content campaign: </strong>  What audience are you trying to reach, and how big is that audience?</li><li> <strong>  What investment is tied to this campaign: </strong>  How much of your marketing budget are you spending on social promotion? Use this amount to measure against how many opportunities are produced from your campaign, providing a clear return on your campaign investment. <br/>  </li><p> All of these metrics will hold your team and company accountable to the growth goals you have in place and help implement processes so your campaigns are fluid and scale as your business grows. They will also help you clearly identify what strategies are working&mdash;and which ones aren&rsquo;t.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  One of the best interrogation seminars I attended was led by a muscular man with a face that looked as though chiseled out of a block of wood. A member of Special Forces, he told me and 30 other FBI agents that the best way to elicit information from another person was to&mdash; </strong></p><p> &mdash;learn how to read them. That, he said, requires two things: careful observation and developing rapport.</p><p> I was stunned. I expected all sorts of tips on how to be sneaky with my questions and intimidating in my manner.</p><p> &ldquo;Always remember that you cannot read people accurately if you don&rsquo;t spend time with them and if they don&rsquo;t trust you,&rdquo; he said.</p><p> As a business owner and entrepreneur, you do not need to be a top notch interrogator to figure out what is going on in someone&rsquo;s head. The signals are always there; all you need to do is know what to look for.</p><p> Here are 9 FBI helpful tips for reading people:</p><h3> 1. Create A Baseline</h3><p> <br/> Spend enough time around a person to get to know their quirks and patterns of behavior. For example, some people clear their throat, look at the floor when talking, cross their arms, scratch their head, stroke their neck, squint, pout, and jiggle their feet frequently.</p><p> In others, however, these same behavior might be indicative of deception, anger, or discomfort.</p><p> Before you can make any judgments or assessments about an individual, create a baseline of their normal behavior.</p><h3> 2. Look For Aberrations</h3><p> <br/> Start looking for inconsistencies between the baseline you&rsquo;ve created and the person&rsquo;s words and gestures. </p><p> For example: your boss normally nods when in conversation with others but when you start talking to her, the nodding stops. Pay attention! Is it you, or is the topic you&rsquo;ve introduced?</p><h3> 3. Notice Clusters of Gestures</h3><p> <br/> No one gesture or word necessarily means anything; but when several behavioral aberrations are clumped together, take notice. </p><p> For example, not only does your boss stop nodding, she also angles her body away from you, leans back, and compresses her lips. </p><p> You are reading her accurately: she has a problem&mdash;either with you or with the topic that you&rsquo;ve introduced into the conversation.</p><h3> 4. Compare And Contrast</h3><p> <br/> Move your observation up a notch to see if/when she repeats that same behavior with others in your group.</p><p> Continue to observe her as she interacts with others in the room. Does her expression change? Does her posture and body language change? Have you noticed a specific change in her behavior toward you?</p><h3> 5. Walk This Way</h3><p> <br/> Notice the way a person walks. People who shuffle along, lack a flowing motion in their movements, hug themselves, and keep their head down, often lack self-confidence.</p><p> Do not be that person! Walk with alertness and purpose, and keep your shoulders back and head held high. When you do, you are signaling to the world that you have an important place to be and an important task to accomplish.</p><h3> 6. Mirror, Mirror On The Wall</h3><p> <br/> Mirror neurons are built-in monitors in our brain that reflect other people&rsquo;s state of mind. </p><p> We are wired to read each other&rsquo;s bodies. A smile activates the smile muscles in our own faces, while a frown activates our frown muscles. </p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_M._Niedenthal\" target=\"_blank\">   Paula Niedenthal  </a> </u>  in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Paula-Niedenthal-Psychology-Interpersonal-Experiential/dp/B00HTJTSC6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Psychology of Emotion  </a> </u> , we are programmed to observe each other&rsquo;s emotions so we can appropriately react, empathize, or assert our boundaries. </p><p> When  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/spycatcher/201108/body-language-basics?collection=116859\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   we see someone we like  </a> </u> , our eyebrows arch, facial muscles relax, head tilts, and blood flows to our lips making them full.</p><p> If this is not reciprocated, that person is sending you a clear message: they do not like you and/or are not happy with your performance. </p><h3> 7. Identify The Strong Voice</h3><p> <br/> Confident people have strong voices. Do not confuse a loud voice with a strong one. </p><p> Confidence and power are kissing cousins. </p><p> Around a conference room table, the most confident person is very likely to also be the most powerful one: expansive posture, strong voice, and a big smile. The most powerful person is not always the one sitting at the head of the table.</p><p> Make sure your body language and behavior make it clear that you are confident and that your message has heft. </p><h3> 8. Use Of Action Words</h3><p> <br/> As an FBI agent, I always looked for clues on what people were thinking, and words were the closest way for me to get into another person&rsquo;s head. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/let-their-words-do-the-talking/201106/reading-people-the-words-they-speak?collection=66671\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Words represent thoughts  </a> </u>  so identify the word that is freighted with meaning. </p><p> For example, if your boss says she, &ldquo;Decided to buy brand X,&rdquo; the action word is decided. This single word tells you that your boss is 1) not impulsive, 2) weighed several options, and 3) thinks things through.</p><p> Another example: if your colleague says, &ldquo;I won another award,&rdquo; the action word is another. She is telling you that she 1) has won awards before, 2) is bolstering her self-esteem, and 3) wants you to know she is a winner.</p><h3> 9. Spot Personality Types</h3><p> <br/> Each of us have our own unique personalities, but there are basic clarifications that can help you relate to another person so you can read them accurately.</p><li> Are they an introvert or extrovert?</li><li> Are they driven by relationships or by significance? </li><li> How do they handle risk and uncertainty?</li><li> What feeds their ego?</li><li> What are their behaviors when they are stressed?</li><li> What are their behaviors when they are relaxed?  <br/>  </li><p> It takes time to learn how to read people accurately. Start practicing now on people you know and with whom you interact. You can develop the skill by constantly listening and observing actively in every day life.</p><p> What tips would you add?</p>",

    "content": "<p> When it comes to social media, a lot of small businesses seem to think that it's not worth their time and effort. But as a recent article on the Media Post notes, <strong>  there's currently a big disconnect between what consumers and clients say they want on social media and what many businesses are delivering. </strong></p><p> According to a recent YouGov survey, on behalf of Enplug, consumers are very keen for small businesses to have a social media presence; despite this, however, large numbers of small businesses are failing to meet expectations.</p><p> The survey, which questioned 506 small businesses and 1,155 consumers, found that <strong>  the majority of social media users on Facebook (63%) and Instagram (76%) would view a small business more favourably if they read a positive review on one of their social media pages. </strong></p><p> However, more than a third of business owners said they didn't allow users to comment on their business on their social media platforms and a similar proportion thought there was simply no value in having a social media presence.</p><p> This seems short-sighted given the huge - and still growing - role social media plays in our lives. As CEO of Enplug Nanxi Liu explains: \"It's now a consumer expectation that not only can they learn about a business on social media, but that they can talk with the business - whether it's to troubleshoot a problem or simply give praise.\"</p><p> A similar report carried out last year by Endurance found that the majority of business owners have no social media strategy in place, with 76% commenting that they publish content only when they have time, and 72% saying \"we have no plan, we just publish when we feel like it.\"</p><p> While the above findings relate to the B2C sector, the same high client expectations for social media face B2B businesses too. The increasing impact social platforms are having on the B2B buyer's journey highlighted by new insights revealed in the recent B2B Buyers Survey Report, published by Demand Gen.</p><p> The comprehensive poll, which accrued data from 173 marketing, sales and IT executives, found that buyers are increasingly looking to social media to connect with industry authorities  when it comes to researching buying decisions - the crucial first step in the buying process.</p><p> In fact, 75% agreed that social media was used in some capacity when conducting this crucial research into business purchases. It is thought that this increase comes, in part, due to more millennials landing key decision-making positions and looking to follow the template of their own personal buying processes in the B2B buying arena.</p><p> B2B buyers are also beginning to mirror consumer buying patterns with 91% agreeing that online reviews are a top factor when choosing between selected vendors; 75% studied conversations and discussion groups on social media to further their knowledge whilst 81% reached out to either third-party authorities to request recommendations or other users for more general suggestions.</p><p> The findings of Demand Gen highlight not only the increasing importance of social media in B2B marketing but the demand amongst buyers for impartial information that can be trusted.</p><p> The bottom line for both B2C and B2B companies is that it's no longer a question of whether or not to embrace social media, given that customers, clients and buyers are have such a strong preference for companies that do so.</p><p> The real question now is whether businesses are prepared to invest the necessary time and and effort into fully professionalising their social media marketing activities. If not, they should seriously consider outsourcing their SMM activities to ensure they have access to the necessary skills and knowledge to meet the expectations of their ever-more demanding target audiences.</p>",

    "content": "<p> People make the world go &rsquo;round. Communication is the grease that keeps us all running smoothly.</p><p> Some people think communication starts with your mouth. No. Others think communication starts with your ears. No. Communication actually starts with body language, whether near or from afar.</p><p> Before we dive into the tips, I&rsquo;d like to share a little story.</p><p> Several years ago when the economy was rough, I needed an assistant. I placed an advertisement online and as suspected received many applicants (504 to be exact).</p><p> I paired it down to thirty people who looked promising on paper. One of my employees phone screened them. I met with ten people we felt would be the best fit.</p><p> I decided to meet the tenth candidate for lunch. As I approached the building, she was sitting on a bench outside. From seventy-five feet away, I caught her stare. She smiled. She rose. Her smile got bigger.</p><p> As we approached each other, she extended her hand and gave me a shake with the proper strength that said you wouldn&rsquo;t need to look any further. Then her words came out, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p> She was nicely dressed and her overall appearance was well, but not overly, manicured.</p><p> She had only uttered six words, but I knew as long as she didn&rsquo;t throw her chopped salad in my lap my search was over.</p><p> She turned out to be absolutely fabulous.</p><p> First things first&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Smile. </strong> Do you realize even though the corners of your mouth need to rise, smiling takes less energy than frowning? People respond to this because you appear warm, welcoming, and nonjudgmental. They want to share themselves with you and learn about you. Smiling is so important I hang up on people who don&rsquo;t smile when they&rsquo;re on the phone with me. I learned this trick from a United Airlines customer service agent when I asked her why she was able to find me a significantly lower airfare when the previous agent I worked with could not. She said, &ldquo;Mr. LaCivita, when you call us and the person who answers isn&rsquo;t smiling, hang up and call back.&rdquo; So, the answer to your question is this technique also works when the other party can&rsquo;t see you.</p><p> <strong>  Shake hands firmly. </strong> I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s a man, woman, child, or dog, give them a good shake. Please stand when you do it. I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re in the middle of your $58 filet mignon. Stand up! Show the other person you think his or her hand is worth shaking. If you&rsquo;re wearing a hat, cap, bandana, headband or whatever else people wear on their heads these days, take it off. It&rsquo;s a polished move and shows you&rsquo;re respectful and cool.</p><p> <strong>  Mind your attire. </strong> When was the last time you walked into a bookstore and dashed to the worst book cover you could find? Of course, people will eventually realize bad writing and bad stories even if your book has a sexy cover. If you&rsquo;re an unpleasant person, it won&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re wearing couture. You&rsquo;ll still be better off dressing well than like a slob. That will at least make a good impression before you open your mouth.</p><p> Think, say, do. You&rsquo;ll never be more in harmony with yourself or the rest of the world than when these three things are the same.</p><p> <strong>  Open your mind. </strong> I like to say an open mind is a peaceful place. Your biases will make you a terrible listener. You&rsquo;ll dismiss what you don&rsquo;t want to believe and rush to an agreement for what you want to believe. Before you can be a great listener, you need to unclutter the baggage and noises in your head.</p><p> <strong>  Stretch your ears. </strong> The weird-looking things on the sides of your head are amazing. Mine help me experience joy before I walk into my house as I hear my fur babies bark before on the other side of the door. They also help you understand what the other party needs or cares about. Be a giver by listening first.</p><p> <strong>  Think positive thoughts right before you open your mouth. </strong> Stay positive. If someone says something, before you respond, it&rsquo;s better to wonder why she thinks what she thinks. Give her the benefit of the doubt. Ask her why. Once you understand her &ldquo;why,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll be able to shape your response in a good-natured way.</p><p> <strong>  Use positive words after you open your mouth. </strong> How you say what you say is just as important as what you say. I&rsquo;m convinced you never need to use negative language even in the harshest of situations. Negative language never yields the best outcomes. It&rsquo;s demotivating.</p><p> Did I hear you correctly?</p><p> <strong>  Perform the intent check. </strong> Even if you have an open mind and are listening, make sure you understood him or her. There needs to be a mutual understanding otherwise you technically miscommunicated. I like to perform an intent check when someone shares something important. Simply repackage what the other person said and confirm, preferably in different words, what the other person meant.</p><p> Your actions speak so loudly I can&rsquo;t hear what you&rsquo;re saying&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Do what you say you&rsquo;ll do. </strong> Smiling and using positive language is meaningless if you don&rsquo;t do what you say you&rsquo;ll do. This nonverbal communication has a higher decibel level than anything that can possibly come out of your mouth&mdash;even if you&rsquo;re screaming at the top of your lungs. Follow through on what you promise!</p>",

    "content": "<p> There are lots of web sites advising women how to go about finding a financial advisor, not surprisingly, most are pretty consistent:</p><li> <strong>  Review the advisor&rsquo;s qualifications and do a background check </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ask about their track record and past performance </strong></li><li> <strong>  Find out how they get paid </strong></li><li> <strong>  Read the fine print/the company code of ethics </strong></li><li> <strong>  Inquire what size of client assets they serve </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> While recommendations like these are well intentioned and have some validity, the reality is, this is simply not the way women choose financial advisors.</h3><p> <br/> To begin with, most women looking for a financial advisor start the process by asking colleagues or friends and family for recommendations. Once they have a few names they may pick one, two or more to interview. Knowing that someone they trust recommended the person they are interviewing gives them a level of comfort.</p><p> Going into the meeting, women rarely ask for credentials, they don&rsquo;t care how much you know about investing. Whether or not it is wise, they simply assume that the professionals they are considering have the appropriate certification and know their craft. What they are really looking for is an &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; fit.</p><p> Consider the case of Sally. At 38, well into a successful career and realizing she would never marry, Sally determined that she needed help managing the assets and savings she had accumulated. She turned to colleagues for recommendations and chose three potential candidates to interview. She told us, &ldquo;they all seemed equally competent.&rdquo; Following much agonizing, she eventually went with her gut and chose the advisor she was the most comfortable with, the one who, like her, was an avid skier. She explained that he had great adventure-holiday pictures in his office that she could relate to and he seemed genuinely interested in her life, not just how much money she had to invest.  </p><p> Sally is not unusual in this. Women tend to look for an emotional connection and a person they can build a relationship with. They understand that performance is important but it is rarely the deciding factor.</p><h3> <strong>  Take away  </strong></h3><p> <br/> By all means, be prepared to answer questions about qualifications and performance &ndash; just don&rsquo;t assume that your answers in those areas will be her primary criteria for choosing you.</p><p> You have to win women over first &ldquo;emotionally.&rdquo; As Teddy Roosevelt said, &ldquo;it is only once they know how much you care that they care about how much you know&rdquo;&hellip;in this case investing.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

    "link": "reprogramming-the-brain-to-make-better-financial-decisions",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> If you've ever struggled to learn new software or unravel a computer problem, you know that part of the frustration of dealing with technology is its logic. Computers respond according to their default operating systems. If we want them to do something different, they need to be reprogrammed.</h3><p> <br/> In the same way, the default operating systems of our brains are actually programmed to make poor financial decisions. This is normal. Making good financial decisions actually takes a deliberate reprogramming of your internal operating system.</p><h3> Here is why.</h3><p> <br/> Our brains are divided into three sections: the reptilian brain, the mammalian brain, and the prefrontal cortex.</p><p> The reptilian brain is the oldest, most primitive part. In a talk at the Financial Therapy Association's annual conference in July 2015 in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, Dr. Ted Klontz explained that the reptilian brain continually scans for threats. It is waiting for death to come walking through the doorway, so it lives in anxiety. Since anything positive is not a threat, it&rsquo;s oblivious to the positive. It also doesn&rsquo;t understand the concept of the future, but lives only in this moment.</p><p> Left to its own programming, then, of course the reptilian brain might have a problem making monthly contributions to a retirement account. Saving for the future isn&rsquo;t a concept it even understands. Further, it sees taking money out of the checkbook as a threat because that leaves fewer resources to battle death when it comes through the doorway. Making things even worse, the reptilian brain is nearly impossible to change. The best most of us can do is manage it.</p><h3> This brings us to the mammalian brain, whose only job is to manage the anxiety of the reptilian brain. It does so in three ways: <br/>  </h3><li> Remove the threat (fight),</li><li> Run away from the threat (flight),</li><li> Get small and disappear to hide from the threat (freeze). <br/>  </li><p> Most of us favor one of these three responses to threats, and according to Dr. Klontz we select our preferred response by the age of six. When the mammalian brain responds, it processes exponentially faster than the thinking part of our brain, the prefrontal cortex. Because of the ease with which the mammalian brain responds to threats, 90% of all decisions&mdash;including financial ones&mdash;are made here.</p><p> With the mammalian brain managing the anxiety of the reptilian brain, we have a more sophisticated response to our potential retirement plan contribution. Some of us will verbally fight and defeat any messenger (article, employer, financial advisor, spouse) that suggests we drain our current resources to send money into a black hole. Others will simply flee the messenger by diverting our attention to the Monday night football game or any task at hand. A portion of us will just freeze into a glassy-eyed stare. Nobody is home.</p><p> That leaves us with our only hope, the understanding and thinking part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex. This part of our brain doesn't fully come on line until the mid-twenties. It functions as the parent of the other two brains, but unfortunately it processes information very slowly and with great effort.</p><h3> Fortunately, this is the brain that is easiest to change.</h3><p> <br/> By training it to become aware when the lower parts of the brain are about to make a hair-trigger decision, we can stop the ensuing action long enough to add logic as well as emotion to the process.</p><p> Reprogramming the brain takes time, practice, and using resources like education, mentors, advisors, and counseling. Eventually, wise financial choices like saving for retirement can become the new default programming, even in spite of the reptilian brain.</p>",

    "content": "<p> You know about the Elevator Pitch.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s the Elevator Code.</h3><p> <br/> I heard about it at a client meeting. A sizeable financial services company. A senior executive brought it up.</p><p> We have a Leadership Council, the spunky leader stated. We want folks to engage with each other. We believe it&rsquo;s good for business. <strong>  So we created a company Elevator Code. </strong></p><h3> The code:</h3><p> <br/> Ride the elevator, and we expect you to say hello to people.</p><p> Simple, isn&rsquo;t it? It means not plugging into your head-phones. It means no texting or other solitary pleasures. No avoiding the other human being in your space.</p><h3> Engage.</h3><p> <br/> Be a social creature, for the short duration of the ride. With the colleague you know. With the colleague you don&rsquo;t know. With the stranger who is visiting your firm.</p><p> Engagement energy activated on the ride up. Energized for the work to come.</p><p> Some folks hated this at first, our spunky leader elaborates. They always rode the elevator at the same time, with the some folks. They had never engaged. Their first instinct was to ride the elevator at a different time.</p><h3> Shocking, isn&rsquo;t it?</h3><p> <br/> By the second hello, she explains, it was oh yeah, great to see you.</p><p> The Elevator Code Happy Ending. It&rsquo;s how acting human works.</p><p> I have my own elevator code. My sushi-counter code. My sit-on-the-airplane code. My smile-at-a-stranger code.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t hide behind the narrative of who you think you are. I&rsquo;m an introvert. I&rsquo;m not a morning person.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Have you ever had a prospect who plays his feelings on your product or service &ldquo;close to the vest&rdquo;?  Someone who simply won&rsquo;t share much of their opinion one way or the other?  Or should I say how many prospects do you have like that? </h3><p> <br/> These days many prospects hide behind nebulous stalls like, <strong>  &ldquo;Let me think about it,&rdquo; </strong> or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run this by the committee,&rdquo; etc., and it&rsquo;s often hard to know where they stand.  And then it gets worse when you try to set an appointment to get back with them only to hear, <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get back to you.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re struggling with prospects like this, then it&rsquo;s time to learn some advanced closing skills that only the Top 5% are comfortable using: And that&rsquo;s asking open ended questions and actually giving your prospect a chance to fully answer &ndash; negatively or positively.  While this may sound easy to do, only the top, top pros know how to fully listen long enough for their prospect to tell them how they really feel.  (HINT: they use their MUTE button!)</p><p> But to get your prospect to open up, you need some well-crafted scripts that you adapt and make your own so you can deliver them sincerely and not sound salesy.  Take some time to review the choices below and do just that &ndash; make them your own:</p><h3> Question One:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;You know ________, we all buy emotionally and go with our gut feelings.  Share with me: What is your gut telling you is good about our solution, and what is it telling you isn&rsquo;t so good?&rdquo;</p><p> [Now hit MUTE and listen &ndash; same advice after each rebuttal]</p><h3> Question Two:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;__________, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re weighing this purchase against some of our competition, so tell me, in what ways are we better than your next option, and in what ways are we weaker?&rdquo;</p><h3> Question Three:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;_________, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of the old Ben Franklin way of making a decision haven&rsquo;t you? (Wait for a response)</p><p> Ben would make a list of all the reasons to make a decision to move forward with something, and all the reasons not to.  If the reasons were stronger to move forward, he would.</p><p> So tell me, what are the reasons, as you see them, for moving forward with this, and what are the reasons not to?&rdquo;</p><h3> Question Four:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;_________, I know there are other people who need to weigh in on the final decision on this, so tell me, if you had to put a wager on it, would you bet that there were more votes on moving forward on this or more votes against it?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer:</p><p> &ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo;</p><h3> Question Five:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Now _________, I know you like what we have, and there are probably some things you don&rsquo;t like.  Tell me, if we could deliver more of what you DO like, what would that be?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer:</p><p> &ldquo;And if we could give you less of what you don&rsquo;t like, what would that be?&rdquo; </p><p> And then, &ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo;</p><h3> Question Six:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;__________, some people love our solution and some people &ndash; believe it or no &ndash; hate it.  Tell me, what do you LOVE about us, and what do you hate about this that is preventing you from moving forward right now?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, these scripts are designed to get someone who is noncommittal to begin opening up and to tell you where they stand &ndash; both positively and negatively.  Once you know where someone is emotionally and logically with your product or service, you&rsquo;ll have the leverage to adjust your close and get closer to a sale.</p>",

    "link": "finserv-so-where-does-blogging-come-in",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Nicola Michel </u></p><p> <strong>  The role of public relations in financial services may not have changed; the need to build and protect brand and reputation remains as strong as ever. </strong></p><h3> But what has changed is the tools PR professionals use. In the brave new world of digital and online, the best PR (and other) wins are scored using an integrated communication approach. And blogging forms an integral part of it.</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re not saying media coverage (a.k.a earned media &ndash; think column inches and editorial) is no longer important. It absolutely is. But the new world of PR is one in which organisations, including financial services, have way more than just the earned media lever at their disposal. When you add to that the power of both owned media (content you publish yourself, eg on your website) and paid (advertising) media into the mix, you have yourself the makings of an integrated model. This puts in your hands the tools you need to direct all your organisation&rsquo;s content to your target audiences via a range of channels &ndash; way beyond traditional media. And that can drive serious business results &ndash; from reputation and brand management right through to hard sales leads.</p><h3> So where does blogging come in?</h3><p> <br/> Falling squarely into the owned section of the integrated camp, blogging is now viewed by some as an alternative to traditional media.</p><h3> Why blog? There are three main reasons.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Builds trust with your financial services organisation </strong></p><p> People like to buy or take recommendations from their friends, or people whose word they trust. A quality blog can help achieve this.</p><p> If the role of PR is to help an organisation build, shape and fine-tune its public voice, your blog can be a powerful tool. But your blog content must not be about you and your product. It must be solving customer problems or giving potential customers information they need or value. Before you write word one, understand who you are creating your content for, the problems they need to solve or the information they are seeking.</p><p> <strong>  2. A blog can position you as an expert </strong></p><p> Before you blog, and once you&rsquo;ve defined your audience, decide what you stand for, what you are trying to communicate, why and with what outcomes. Then, be consistent. If you can provide reliable and trustworthy information on the industry (say for advisers or institutional investors), helpful reviews and explanation of products for consumers or advisers, and even comment on business and economic issues, over time you can position yourself as expert in your sphere. And everybody loves an expert.</p><p> <strong>  3. Search engine optimization </strong></p><p> The holy grail of SEO is to have your business land on the first page of Google without any paid advertisement. Failing that, the aim is to rank high in search results for whatever your potential customers are looking for. Enter blogging. Judicious use of keywords in your blogs can boost your search results enormously.</p><p> So get onto your keyword analysis ASAP so you can let those Google bots know what you know &ndash; and be rewarded for it.</p><h3> Three top tips to getting the most from your blog</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Looking for lead generation? Blog regularly </strong></p><p> If your aim is to generate leads, aim to blog three times a week.</p><p> <strong>  2. Use analytics to guide you </strong></p><p> Be sure to track your success in Google Analytics (or any other analytics tool you use).</p><p> Key metrics to consider include:</p><li> session times (long is better than short)</li><li> bounce rate (low is better than high)</li><li> page views (more is better than less) <br/>  </li><p> Demographic data is also a rich source of information about who your readers are, where they come from and to see the other topics they are interested in.</p><p> This information can help you round out your personas, and provide them with the kind of content they are looking for.</p><p> We &ldquo;get&rdquo; that what clients or members, versus advisors or accountants, or institutional investors or fund managers will value is different. Very different. So cater to those different needs and let the numbers then tell you which content works and which doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> <strong>  3. Leverage, leverage, leverage </strong></p><p> If your blog is getting good engagement and reach, this can guide broader activity you undertake in the business (including the kinds of pitches you make to trade and finance journalists) because you have had evidence of what your audience is actually interested in.</p><h3> The bottom line?</h3><p> <br/> Get started. Understand your audience, give them what they want and be consistent. Your blog, as part of an integrated communication model, can be a powerful tool in public relations success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfarivar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Cyrus Farivar  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ars Technica  </u> </a></p><h3> \"The effect on the average US taxpayer is that the US government is deprived of revenue.\"</h3>More than any other American company, Apple holds $181.1 billion in offshore accounts, according to a <u> Tuesday report</u> released by Citizens for Tax Justice, an advocacy group.Other major American tech firms&mdash;including Cisco, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and Oracle&mdash;are among the largest companies that are using legal but questionable tax tricks to keep money overseas and effectively pay little to no American federal corporate taxes.Citizens for Tax Justice concluded: \"Multinational corporations&rsquo; use of tax havens allows them to avoid an estimated $90 billion in federal income taxes each year.\"One tax law professor told Ars that this untapped revenue source could stand to significantly benefit the United States.\"Losing $90 billion of potential tax revenues every year is a very big deal,\" <u> <a href=\"http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=11219\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Neil Buchanan </a></u>, a professor at George Washington University, said by e-mail. \"That money could be used to reverse recent cuts in Head Start, and/or assistance to state governments to fund education at all levels, or increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, and on and on. Politicians who respond to proposals to fund these programs by saying that &lsquo;we can't afford it&rsquo; are simply saying, &lsquo;I'd rather cut Apple's tax bill than educate our children.&rsquo;\"<h3> As the organization wrote in its findings:</h3>[Apple] would owe $59.2 billion in US taxes if these profits were not officially held offshore for tax purposes. This means that Apple has paid a miniscule 2.3 percent tax rate on its offshore profits. That confirms that Apple has been getting away with paying almost nothing in taxes on the huge amount of profits it has booked in Ireland.<h3> Similarly, it noted with respect to Google:</h3>Google reported operating 25 subsidiaries in tax havens in 2009, but since 2010 only discloses two, both in Ireland. During that period, it increased the amount of cash it reported offshore from $7.7 billion to $47.4 billion. An academic analysis found that as of 2012, the 23 no-longer-disclosed tax haven subsidiaries were still operating.<h3> For Microsoft, the group concluded:</h3>Microsoft reported operating 10 subsidiaries in tax havens in 2007; in 2014, it disclosed only five. During this same time period, the company increased the amount of money it held offshore from $7.5 billion to $108.3 billion, on which it says it would owe $34.5 billion in U.S. taxes. That implies that the company has paid a tax rate of just 3 percent to foreign governments on those profits, indicating that most of the cash is booked to tax havens. Microsoft ranks 3rd for the amount of cash it keeps offshore. A Wall Street Journal investigation found that over 90 percent of Microsoft \"offshore\" cash was actually invested by its offshore subsidiaries in U.S. assets like Treasuries, allowing for the company to benefit from the stability of the U.S. financial system without paying taxes on those profits.<h3> Taxes, schmaxes</h3><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/11/dutch-sandwich-with-a-side-of-tax-relief-may-soon-be-off-googles-menu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Ars has previously detailed </u></a> how such arrangements typically work.Bloomberg reporter Jesse Drucker <u> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  first described </a></u> the process in 2010: a company sells or licenses its foreign rights for intellectual property developed in the United States to a subsidiary in a country with lower tax rates. The result? Foreign profits that come from that tech&mdash;like the rights to Google&rsquo;s search and advertising technology, effectively the keys to the kingdom&mdash;are now attributed to that offshore subsidiary rather than the Mountain View, California, headquarters. The subsidiaries have to pay \"arm&rsquo;s length\" prices for those rights, just like an outside company would.Bloomberg<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>  concluded </u></a>: \"Because the payments contribute to taxable income, the parent company has an incentive to set them as low as possible.

Google paid &euro;11.7 billion in \"administrative expenses,\" which <u> The Irish Times</u> reports \"largely refers to royalties paid to other Google entities, some of which are ultimately controlled from tax havens such as Bermuda.\"But, other tax law experts noted that such a system is unlikely to change any time soon, <u> <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/01/silicon-valley-attempts-to-slow-new-global-tax-avoidance-reform-proposals/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  despite international efforts to do so </a></u>.\"The effect on the average US taxpayer is that the US government is deprived of revenue,\" <u> <a href=\"http://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/full-time/marian/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Omri Marian </a></u>, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, told Ars by e-mail.\"US corporate tax collection as a percentage of GDP is currently at an all time low.

    "content": "<p> <strong>  If you&rsquo;re like most managers, you know the importance of helping your team see the bigger picture. You would do more, if you only had the time. </strong> The occasional all-hands meetings help, but without interim reinforcement, those  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/host_a_kickoff/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   motivational meetings  </a> </u>  can feel like a fire hose of plans and numbers. If you want your team to truly &ldquo;get it,&rdquo; sprinkle little bits of big picture reinforcement into their week.</p><h3> 6 Ways to Get Your Employees to See the Big Picture</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;The big picture doesn&rsquo;t just come from distance; it also comes from time.&rdquo;  -Simon Sinek </strong></p><p> <strong>  1.&rdquo;Postcards&rdquo; </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to forget that the main reason many employees don&rsquo;t think more strategically is a lack of information. It&rsquo;s hard to connect the dots when a third of them are invisible.  It&rsquo;s also tough to translate all you heard three days later. What I&rsquo;ve found works quite well is just to send soundbites out via text message throughout some of the more strategic meetings I attend.</p><p> I make them fun and relevant to their roles. It creates interest and sets the table for the more robust conversations that follow.  These have worked for years, long before 140 characters was the way of the world. &ldquo;Oh boy, Competitor X just launched new plans that will change the way customers think about our pricing. Let&rsquo;s talk more on Monday.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2. Gamification </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s easier than ever to turn learning into a game. In most of my keynotes I use  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kiwilive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   kiwilive  </a> </u>  as a simple platform to poll or ask questions,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.polleverywhere.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   poll everywhere  </a> </u>  is free for up to 25 responses (no, neither of these companies are paying me).  Participants can &ldquo;compete&rdquo; on who knows your big picture fun facts from the convenience of their phone.</p><p> <strong>  3. Bring-a-Friend Staff Meetings </strong></p><p> Sometimes the best way to understand how sausage is made, is to help make it. Giving people exposure to the conversation and thought process, not just the outcomes of strategic decisions, goes a long way in helping people connect the dots. Every time I&rsquo;ve held a &ldquo;bring-a-friend staff meeting&rdquo; where my direct reports each bring one of their direct reports, you can almost see the light bulbs going on.</p><p> <strong>  4. Field Trips </strong></p><p> There&rsquo;s a reason every elementary school takes a trip to the zoo. You can read about giraffes all you want, but until you have one bend down and lick your face, it&rsquo;s hard to really understand what they&rsquo;re all about. There&rsquo;s real power in taking a &ldquo;field trip&rdquo; to another department and seeing how they really think and operate.</p><p> <strong>  5. Mentoring Circles </strong></p><p> I&rsquo;ve shared this idea with you before. I&rsquo;m repeating my self because mentoring circles work.  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/mentoring-in-circles/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Click here for more information.  </u>    </a>   If you want more information on mentoring you can download my FREE eBook,  <u>  Mentoring in the Age of the Millennial from my new ecourse landing page </u> .</p><p> <strong>  6. Teaching Operations Reviews </strong></p><p> Another one of my key go-tos.

    "content": "<p> Ask yourselves as business partners these 2 questions to find out if you are endangering your business:</p><h3> 1- Is there anything I avoid speaking to my partner about because it feels too painful, annoying, or confrontational?</h3><h3> <br/> 2- Is there something I suspect that my partner is avoiding bringing up for one of those same reasons?</h3><p> <br/> Most of us would rather not get into arguments or even talk about something that pushes our buttons. Conflict is bad for your health, your personal life and definitely bad for your business when the partners who own it don&rsquo;t get along.</p><p> When disagreements have reached the stage of ongoing conflict, emotions have overcome the issue. At this point no one is thinking clearly or speaking truthfully about the original problem. It becomes all about winning. How useful is that?</p><p> You can win the battle and lose a whole lot more. As it does to a marriage, conflict becomes a nail in the coffin of your business partnership. Though you may end up in court and even &ldquo;win&rdquo;, you often lose in life. .</p><h3> Even if conflict doesn't reach this dramatic, sad and costly finale, living with conflict is an unhappy, unhealthy situation. Not only does it cause you misery, but it is contagious. Employees, clients and family members feel the tension. They may be taking sides even without knowing the unspoken details of why there is this tension.</h3><p> <br/> If you and your partner avoid meeting, deteriorate into a yelling match when you do meet, or live in silence without addressing the important aspects of running your business you are putting your business in danger. Even if you never break up and go out of business, there is no way it can function well in these circumstances.   The effect of your conflict is that the machine cannot run smoothly and your earnings, the reason you are in business in the first place, will show it.</p><p> Tom and George avoided each other like the plague. Tom believed he was doing most of the work and his level of compensation should show it. George vehemently disagreed and they stopped talking to each other over this disagreement. They each focused on their area of expertise, but didn&rsquo;t see how that focus was eroded due to the lack of coordination between them. As a result the sales and marketing division also didn&rsquo;t talk to the design or fulfillment teams. The managers of the divisions were often confused about how what they were doing or not doing fit into the picture at any given moment. Everyone was shooting from the hip and running the business by putting out fires, sending ambiguous emails between departments and overall chaos became the norm.  There was demoralization at all levels. Some of the most valuable people were sending out their resumes.</p><h3> The business was definitely in danger because those running it dropped the ball over an unresolved issue between them.</h3><p> <br/> The best solution to conflict resolution is conflict prevention. Resolve things at the disagreement level before they become conflicts. If it&rsquo;s too late for prevention call in a relationship expert to coach you ASAP before things deteriorate beyond repair.</p><p> <strong>  Now is the time to remember that there were good reasons you chose your partner. </strong> If you were honest and sincere in your initial evaluation and desire to succeed, it's helpful to keep that in mind when things get rough. Find your way back to that place of harmony and mutual respect.</p><p> The first step in resolving conflict is to agree to do so and to agree on the ultimate goal, the success of the business, which is greater than each of you as individuals. When you are seriously committed to the same outcome things can usually work out. When you've reached this point, a third party, non-biased expert coach is not just desirable, but essential to facilitate discussions and keep emotions at bay. Once you&rsquo;ve done this enough times with help, found a win/win solution, you will be able to run the business or your own using the tools you learned with expert help.</p><p> A successful business is not just your livelihood, but likely the biggest part of your life. It sustains you on many levels, provides for your family, jobs for your employees, a good product or service to your customers and is an asset to your community.   Think of all of this when you avoid dealing with each other over an unresolved conflict. For help in having the difficult conversations, call in a relationships expert.</p>",

    "link": "daughters-and-sense-10-money-lessons-worth-passing-down",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> When it came to matters of money, my mother wore the proverbial pants in the family. A strong willed single parent and the eldest child of nine siblings, she was the breadwinner who had to make dollars and cents out of it all just to keep clothes on our back and a roof over our heads.</h3><p> <br/> But like every teenage daughter in the 80&rsquo;s I wanted it all, especially my MTV, Vidal Sassoon hair, and first pair of Calvins so I too could look, sound, and act just like Brooke Shields in the commercials. &ldquo;Tina, money doesn&rsquo;t grow on trees,&rdquo; was the first lesson I learned growing up in the school of hard knocks.  The second was to get a job and go to work at the ripe old age of 11 as a mother&rsquo;s helper; a popular, well-known practice of child slave labor at the time between mothers and daughters.</p><p> Unbeknownst to me, there was a scientific method to my upbringing especially in the repetitive use of the word NO. The combination of this annoying sound &ndash;one consonant and one vowel&ndash;used daily and repeatedly, provided the foundational elements of an incredibly strong work ethic, a few good pairs of Jordache jeans, and even some lifelong money lessons for my own kids. While their teenage wants were quite different than mine, I too preached the gospel of the word NO a thousand times as to hear my mother&rsquo;s voice reverberate inside my head. I&rsquo;m sure the parents reading this now did exactly the same thing. How many requests for a new iPhone can one have? Apparently many.</p><p> So being a mother in the money business with two working, successful college-grad kids I&rsquo;m often asked, &ldquo;What should I be teaching my daughter about money?&rdquo; While it is true both my daughter and son had the luxury of being raised by two loving helicopter parents, here&rsquo;s my own take on what I call Daughters and Sense, 10 money lessons worth passing down (with a shout-out to my mom of course):</p><h3> 1. Practice the art of delayed gratification.</h3><p> The saying good things come to those who wait is true. Delayed gratification is about learning how to be patient when there is an insatiable need for stuff that usually falls into the category of non-necessities. Rather than using emotion and acting upon impulse, the timing for purchases should be based on logic: 1. Can I afford it and B. Do I really need it? Although the concept sounds pretty easy, in practice it is very hard to do, especially with a fashionista teenage daughter. Mastering the art of delayed gratification takes time. I have found starting small and with a shorter time horizon helps, a few days vs a few weeks is a much easier challenge. In the end, time actually works to our advantage and we learn to appreciate the things we work and wait for.</p><h3> 2. Go to work.</h3><p> Ok maybe not at the age of 11 but with a few simple chores or a part-time job. Getting that first paycheck in your hand begins to teach the value of a dollar and the effect of taxes and deductions on take-home pay. In addition, the principles of budgeting are introduced naturally as waiting between paycheck to paycheck can feel like an eternity. Having a job is great but the upside of being able to buy the things you want, on your own, is a lesson all girls must learn if they are to grow up to be responsible, self-sufficient women.</p><h3> 3. Begin investing in your 20&rsquo;s.</h3><p> Encourage your daughter(s) to get comfortable with investments by creating a small individual trading account in her 20&rsquo;s. Let her learn about financial markets, and investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds, mutual funds, and different indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. Understanding the law of compound interest and how a few dollars today can turn into big money over the course of a lifetime is one of the most important principles in finance we can pass down. Learning these concepts early is the secret to money mastery later in life, when the values are much larger and therefore the risks of making an ill-informed decision.  <u>  Related Compound Interest - A Girl's Best Friend  </u></p><h3> 4. Set up a checking account and use automatic deposit.</h3><p> Do not, I repeat, do not let your daughter cash her paycheck! This is a surefire way to ensure that every penny is spent and none saved. Furthermore, it encourages frivolous spending on the non-essentials like clothes, make-up, shoes, dining out, and recreation which when added together, can exhaust a wallet full of cash in a heartbeat. In order for saving to be successful with young girls, it must be habitual as well as automated and online. They might not check their balances as much as Facebook but they will begin to take pride having their own account and develop personal money management skills such as saving, reconciling a checkbook, and even using online bill pay for some of their expenses.</p><h3> 5. If your company offers a match, take it and run! </h3><p> Many companies still sponsor a retirement plan at work called a 401(k) account. Educational institutions have similar plans called 403(b) and 457 that are funded with pre-taxed (no taxes taken out) dollars. Some employers match part or all of their employees&rsquo; retirement account contributions, 3 percent for example, which is basically freeee money! Explain to your daughter(s) that not taking advantage of an employer 401(k) match can wind up costing her thousands of dollars of free money that could be building tax-free in a retirement account. Furthermore, 401(k) contributions will lower her wages subject to federal income tax, reducing the overall tax liability owed when she files her annual income tax return. You can also just say, honey, a match is a no brainer. Do it or else.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Some couples just seem to get it right. Right? </strong> And some of us are lucky to know a few couples like that. And in getting it right, there are many things they don&rsquo;t do that helps them stand apart. And, often its those things that people don&rsquo;t do that create a healthier, sustainable relationship.</p><p> Here are some of the things that healthy couples don&rsquo;t do that rise to the top.</p><h3> 1. They don&rsquo;t keep score. </h3><p> If you are keeping score then you are only centered on what you are doing, to the exclusion of your partner. If you are &lsquo;up&rsquo; according to keeping score, then your partner is &lsquo;down.&rsquo;</p><h3> 2. Demand Sex. </h3><p> They recognize that sex and more importantly, sexual intimacy is a two way street. They have learned how to have a conversation about their needs, without putting demands on their partner.</p><h3> 3. Have consistent harsh set ups.</h3><p> Rather, they have soft start ups. For example,  &lsquo;is this a good time to talk?&rsquo; If not, when? They choose their timing. They start with something positive. They are aware of their tone and infliction &ndash; which goes a long ways.</p><h3> 4. Invalidate their spouse/partner. </h3><p> They don&rsquo;t wait for the other person to finish so they can defend their position nor do they invalidate their partner or spouse by saying, &lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t feel that way.&rsquo;</p><h3> 5. Disrespect their partner&rsquo;s needs.</h3><p> They are respectful of how their partner/spouse feels about something and seeks to understand, not be dismissive &ndash; even if they don&rsquo;t always agree with them.</p><h3> 6. Call them names. </h3><p> I am not speaking of a &lsquo;slip of the tongue&rsquo; that merely everyone is guilty of but rather a way of talking to them through using derogatory, abusive, and negative words.</p><h3> 7. Nit pick.</h3><p> Sure, we all have those little idiosyncratic (and pesky) things that our partner does that gets on our nerves. I am talking deliberately going after your partner/spouse and picking at every little thing they do. All this does is taint the positive in the person.</p><h3> 8. Take a trip down memory lane - for all the wrong reasons. </h3><p> They don&rsquo;t bring up things that happened in the past that strike a cord and keep the tension between them strong. If there is something that is still bothering them, they find the time to have a conversation to resolve what&rsquo;s still bothering them.</p><h3> 9. Need to have the last word. </h3><p> (What is that anyway?) That&rsquo;s for people who are still acting like a 10 year old. They are not bent on making sure they have the last word because that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything.</p><h3> 10.) Have grand expectations.</h3><p> They don&rsquo;t expect their partner to fulfill all of their needs and know they cannot do the same for them. They realize that a healthy relationship is one that is interdependent &ndash; neither independent or dependent. They recognize they &ndash; and only they- are responsible for their happiness and that one person can never fulfill another person&rsquo;s every need.</p><h3> 11.) Give ultimatums.</h3><p> The &lsquo;you better or else&rsquo; never enters their mind because one its a poor way of communicating their needs and two &ndash; all that does is undermine any trust that existed in the relationship. Its a sure fire way to quickly shut down any communication that might have occurred and puts the other person on the defense.</p><h3> 12.) Crowd them. </h3><p> We all need a little space. They realize that one of the greatest gifts in a relationship is the space that exists between two people. That&rsquo;s where a lot of growth and safety is created. They have the ability to give their partner/spouse the space they need but do not feel threatened by that. This speaks volumes about the relationship. Space could be being in the same room but not having to talk, not always knowing what they are doing, time away from you and time with friends or time alone.</p><p> What are some of the things you do in your relationship that make it healthy and strong?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Now and then, a particular theme seems to hit me from all sides at once.</h3><p> <br/> Two weeks ago, I was fortunate to catch a performance of a stunning new play called  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scr.org/calendar/view?id=7427\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vietgone  </a> </u>  at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scr.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   South Coast Repertory  </a> </u>  in nearby Costa Mesa. (The local run just ended, but if you ever get the chance to see it elsewhere, GO!) The story revolves around a Vietnamese couple who met in an Arkansas refugee camp after the evacuation of Saigon. Throughout the play, as the Vietnamese and English languages are shared, mistranslated, and misheard (all in English for the audience&rsquo;s sake) some of the richest comedy of the play spills out. I&rsquo;m still laughing thinking about it!</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-01-at-12.58.26-PM-2.png\" width=\"586\"/></p><p> The next week, I got on a plane and headed to Austin, Texas for a conference for financial advisors hosted by the investment firm  <u>  <a href=\"https://us.dimensional.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DFA  </a> </u> . One of the wonderful speakers discussed the importance of &ldquo;talking in language your clients understand.&rdquo; Her point? Here&rsquo;s just one example: While most investors (perhaps yourself included) think of their investments in &ldquo;stocks and bonds,&rdquo; financial advisors (perhaps myself included!) often speak about &ldquo;equities and fixed income.&rdquo; I always make it a point not to speak in financial jargon, but I began to wonder if my clients hear something equivalent to a foreign language spilling out of my mouth.</p><p> The theme continued over the weekend when I extended my stay in Austin to visit my sister Susan. Over a glass of wine, I started to share what I was thinking about. As soon as I mentioned &ldquo;stocks and bonds,&rdquo; my sister blurted out: &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t buy stocks for your clients&mdash;you buy mutual funds.&rdquo; I felt like I was back in the audience at Vietgone watching people try to communicate but just missing the mark.</p><p> <strong>  In homage to Halloween, I&rsquo;ll say my sister&rsquo;s comment put the last nail in the coffin. </strong> I hadn&rsquo;t seen it before, but clearly there is a significant language barrier when it comes to money and investing. While we may all think we're clear, in reality what we&rsquo;re saying to each other may be about as clear as&hellip;mud. And it&rsquo;s not just the difference in our understanding of technical terms. Much of it has to do with our emotional reaction to what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;the language of money.&rdquo; And everyone&rsquo;s reactions are different. For instance, when you think of being poor, is that bad to you? Is beingrich good? Or vice versa? Does the word saving bring up feelings of accomplishment&hellip; or deprivation? There&rsquo;s no right or wrong, but how those words feel to you may have more to do with your past experiences, your personal motivations, and your financial goals than they do with the actual meaning of the words themselves.</p><p> For instance, think about the word invest. It means to &ldquo;commit money in order to earn a financial return.&rdquo; That sounds like a great idea, right? For many people, when they hear the word invest, they think gamble. Sure, there is always a risk of loss associated with any investment. But in capitalism, investors are paid to take calculated, prudent risks. But long-term investing in a diversified portfolio provides the potential for that significant financial return in the dictionary definition.</p><h3> Volatility is always one of my favorites. It inevitably brings up negative connotations. Volatile people. Volatile situations. Volatile governments.</h3><p> <br/> And yet, when it comes to the market, volatility simply means &ldquo;sudden change.&rdquo; Even when market volatility is referring to a decline in market prices, it&rsquo;s just as rational to look at that as an opportunity to buy as it is to see a reason to worry. (For more on how I see volatility, read my blog  <u>  <a href=\"/advisor/volatility-escalators-and-yo-yos\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Volatility, escalators, and yo-yos  </a> </u> .)</p><p> Which is more appealing to you: saving or paying off debt? There are certainly different motivations for each. You may be saving for a dream vacation or for retirement, which can be positive because you&rsquo;re working toward a positive goal, or negative because you feel deprived while you&rsquo;re putting the money away. Paying off debt can feel negative because it&rsquo;s something you owe. Yet saving and paying off debt have an equal impact on your net worth. That knowledge alone can empower you to make better decisions based on your financial reality rather than your emotions.</p><p> Coming back full circle to my sister&rsquo;s comment, it&rsquo;s important to note that investing in a mutual fund is the same as owning stock in companies. This type of pooled investment vehicle gives investors the opportunity to diversify into many great companies.  <u>  DFA portfolios </u>  include stocks in 12,000 companies in 40 countries&mdash;a strategy that allows investors to place 12,000 bets, of which many are sure to pay off. It&rsquo;s rare that my clients invest in a single company. Even historically big names like  <u>  <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=IBM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IBM  </a> </u> ,  <u>  Exxon Mobil </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Macy&rsquo;s  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=AAPL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple  </a> </u>  have seen major downturns. But as part of a diversified portfolio, these swings are hedged by upturns in other stocks. (Hedged. There&rsquo;s another one!)</p><h3> When it comes to the language of money, there are so many terms that are filled with innuendo.</h3><h3> <br/> - Passive versus active investing.  <br/> - Fixed income.  <br/> - Equities.  <br/> - Conventional investing and evidence-based investing.</h3><p> <br/> The list is long. But until I have the time on my hands to create a thesaurus, let&rsquo;s all do our best to communicate as clearly as possible. If I&rsquo;m not clear, ask me to decode. And I&rsquo;ll do the same. I&rsquo;d prefer to keep the mistranslations and misunderstandings to a comedy on the stage.</p><p> What other money terms make your head spin? Send me your thoughts.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jstackpool\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jim Stackpole  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  I reckon financial advice industry is entering a new phase of professionalism and opportunity, only everyone doesn&rsquo;t seem that excited about it. </strong></p><p> As with any change there are many advice licensees and practices that refuse to embrace anything new and evolve.</p><p> No matter what happens there will be advisers that&rsquo;ll ultimately find themselves trapped in untenable positions beyond their control due to the convergence of factors like technology, regulation and increasing consumer knowledge which is already causing radical disruption.</p><p> With the inevitably tightening of advice fees and margins across the industry, consumers won&rsquo;t buy much of the &lsquo;spin&rsquo; from advisers self-proclaiming their ethics and professionalism, expecting consumers to pay higher pricing based upon only their word for it.</p><p> <strong>  Today&rsquo;s advice consumers is more savvy and cynical. </strong></p><p> They don&rsquo;t believe that BlackBerry technology is vastly superior to mobile competitors like Apple and Samsung and they won&rsquo;t believe an adviser has the necessary skills and qualifications just because they say so.</p><p> There are some practical steps advisers can take to secure their ongoing success and prosperity in the face of digital disruption and consumer mistrust, however, the right approach will differ from adviser-to-adviser depending on what advice generation they belong to.</p><h3> <strong>  Fourth generation advisers? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Since the inception of the financial planning industry, three distinct types of adviser and advice business have emerged but now I reckon a fourth advice generation is rising up.</p><p> <strong>  Fourth generation firms put their clients first in all their dealings. Literally. </strong></p><p> They aren&rsquo;t building businesses with the intention to sell to anyone who happens to be the highest bidder at a later date. Particularly if that bidder is &lsquo;aligned&rsquo; to specific product or platform offering.</p><p> Nor are they chasing payments, or other benefits, from product or platform providers.</p><p> These advisers are paid by their clients based purely upon the quality of their service and advice they provide year-after-year.</p><p> Fourth generation advisers derive their sense of worth and value by delivering a comprehensive service that removes financial complexity from their clients&rsquo; lives, increases financial certainty and ultimately leads to improved client outcomes.</p><p> While they come from disparate backgrounds including risk, investments, accounting, lending and the law, they all provide strategic advice and act as the project manager of their clients&rsquo; financial lives. Unlike previous generations, they&rsquo;re not necessarily targeting retirees or high net worth clients. They&rsquo;re broadly interested in helping everyday Australians recognise the value of professional advice and their need of it.</p><p> Their mindsets and principles about why they will grow and be rewarded are vastly different to the first, second and third generation of adviser.</p><h3> <strong>  What are the four advice generations? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first generation of financial planners are a group of like-minded product experts. They&rsquo;re akin to pharmacists working for major retail chains &ndash; technically savvy with strong soft skills.</p><p> First generation financial planners commonly heralded from companies like MLC, National Mutual, AMP, Prudential, Australian Eagle and Capita, or the latest incarnation of those institutions. They have great people skills and strong product knowledge which is essential for consumers want a &lsquo;retail&rsquo; advice experience.</p><p> Like the first generation, the second advice generation is transaction or &lsquo;event&rsquo; focused but they&rsquo;ve gone a little further due to the rise of master trust and wrap platforms. They evolved into platform providers, designing a variety of applications that allowed them to clip the ticket along the way.</p><p> This approach has been extremely lucrative for the fortunate few who have been able to carve out a niche.</p><p> The third advice generation are newer entrants or refugees from either the first or second model. Many of the third generation have amalgamated together because they recognise that by banding together there&rsquo;s a higher chance of a &lsquo;liquidity&rsquo; event such as a trade sale to a any listed (or unlisted) diversified financial company looking to expand via acquisition. As a result this generation can be easily perceived to focus on prioritising stakeholders returns over their clients.</p><p> The fourth advice generation&rsquo;s single, main priority is the client. There&rsquo;ll be a lot of collaboration within this group as they work towards improving the public perception of financial advice to encourage more Australians to seek advice.</p><p> This generation seeks to remove the clutter and conflict inherent in most financial advice. They are laying the cornerstone to support a new, pure advice profession which serves the greater public good with authentic value for money advice.</p><p> What do you reckon?</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  So many of our actions are not intentional, but rather happen because of circumstances that may be out of our control.  </strong> If you&rsquo;ve had a bad day at work, it&rsquo;s hard to flip the switch and put a difficult work experience out of your mind and walk in the door happy and carefree.  When your kids jump on you and want to play, is your reaction to join in or have some quiet downtime first? If your spouse has prepared a romantic dinner for the two of you, are you able to clear your mind and enjoy or would you rather just eat in silence in front of the TV?</p><p> On the flip side, if you are dealing with issues in your marriage and spent the evening arguing with your spouse, are you then able to joyfully awake in the morning with a clear head and embrace the day ahead?  If you are dealing with marital, financial or family issues, when you get dressed in the morning, that stress gets dressed and goes to the workplace with you.</p><p> The skeptics amongst us might argue that work can be a sanctuary and a place where you can focus on other things. Truth be told, you can&rsquo;t really leave your cares at the office door.  It just doesn&rsquo;t happen. If you are happy and engaged at work, then you are better positioned to address the issues in your personal life. However, it will only serve to make your personal struggles that much harder to handle if you are unhappy and disengaged at work.</p><p> When I first set out to write Coming Alive: The Journey To Reengage Your Life And Career I was totally focused on the epidemic of disengagement in the workplace.  That&rsquo;s what I knew and had authentically lived through for a large percentage of my career, even thought I didn&rsquo;t put a name to it till many years later.  Reading my own words, I realized that I had blinders on as to how my career disengagement had impacted the lives of my friends and loved ones.</p><h3> That got me thinking about the notion that what occurs in the workplace can impact your personal life and vice versa. These two worlds feed off of each other and either come together in a joyous abundance of engagement or collide in a dismal bout of disengagement. I realized then that the crossover between work and home couldn&rsquo;t be ignored.  Our two lives, both at home and at work are forever linked together. You can&rsquo;t compartmentalize your life. </h3><p> <br/> A colleague once told me that she thinks she&rsquo;s a better parent and partner when she&rsquo;s disengaged. When I asked why she said it&rsquo;s because she leaves the office early and doesn&rsquo;t work when at home, that part of her brain is shut off until the next morning and she concentrates on the needs of her family. I truly wonder how &lsquo;present&rsquo; and how at peace she is when at home when the next morning has her waking to another day of disengagement.  Just food for thought&hellip;.</p>",

Having the right expertise, experience, and job skills are a first step, but they alone won&rsquo;t ensure job satisfaction and retention. Employers should look to alignment of purpose first when selecting talent for the long-term.</p><p> Consider the results of  <u>  <a href=\"https://netimpact.org/research-and-publications/talent-report-what-workers-want-in-2012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NetImpact&rsquo;s 2012 Talent Report  </a> </u> : 53% of workers (and 72% of students) said that having a job where they can make a social or environmental impact is &ldquo;essential to my happiness&rdquo; &hellip; and more important than being wealthy or having a prestigious career. Workers who say they can make an impact while on the job report greater satisfaction than those who can&rsquo;t by a 2:1 ratio, and those who don&rsquo;t would take a pay cut to have a job that does. Employees find it essential to work for a company that shares their values (67%), contributes to society (53%), and works to make the world a better place (51%) &hellip; and students &ndash; tomorrow&rsquo;s workforce &ndash; increased these numbers by 10 points across the board.</p><p> Companies that have a clearly defined and articulated purpose &ndash; identifying a need in the world and their unique ability to fill it &ndash; are better positioned to attract employees who find their values reflected in that purpose. When employees make a conscious choice to align themselves with a purpose they are more committed, more productive and more likely to stay. Having a clear and compelling purpose not only allows companies to capture the Heartpsace of their customers, but their employees as well.</p><h3> Has your company discovered its purpose? Have your forged your story and are you shouting it from the mountaintops?</h3><p> <br/> Are you using your purpose as a visible filter for decision making ( <u>  <a href=\"http://brandforging.wpengine.com/authenticity-why-rei-is-one-of-the-top-100-places-to-work-18-years-in-a-row/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   like REI announced last week  </a> </u> )? Can the people who represent your brand, from hiring managers to janitors, tell the story of your purpose in their own words? Until you can answer yes to these questions, your company is missing the first step in addressing the problem of turnover: the draw of purpose.</p>",

    "link": "three-monster-trends-impacting-the-ria-landscape",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In late 2014 and early 2015, many financial industry observers made projections for what might be the dominant themes impacting RIA firms in the near future. As we close in on the largest RIA-focused conference of the year,  <u>  <a href=\"http://impact.schwab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Schwab IMPACT  </a> </u>  &ndash; held in Boston in mid-November &mdash; the time is right to check in on the pulse of these issues.</p><h3> 1. 2015: The Year of the Robo Adviser? </h3><p> <br/> Nearly every week, there is a story that hits the headlines about another major firm looking to launch their own robo-adviser ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20151021/FREE/151029965/a-robo-adviser-may-be-in-the-works-for-morgan-stanley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Morgan Stanley in the news on October 22  </a> </u> ) or partner with an existing platform, as Fidelity has done,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/betterment-announces-partnership-with-fidelity-2014-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   teaming up with Betterment a year ago  </a> </u>  and adding LearnVest to its platform in late 2014. But, what will the lasting impact be?</p><p> Elliott Weisbluth, founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hightoweradvisors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HighTower  </a> </u> , weighed in on robo-advisers with InvestmentNews in May saying, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to dislodge and disintermediate unskilled and mediocre financial advisers.&rdquo;</p><p> Likewise, Deborah Fox, chief executive of the  <u>  <a href=\"https://foxfinancialplanningnetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fox Financial Planning Network  </a> </u> , said, &ldquo;Most advisers who don&rsquo;t evolve their firms to leverage the new investment tech, as well as repricing within the next couple of years will, at best, have a hard time winning clients and, at worst, begin losing clients.&rdquo;</p><p> Our take is simple. 2015 might not be the year of the robo-adviser, but it may be the year that the financial services industry finally realizes the need to digitize and revolutionize their own financial advice process and their client experience offering. Most firms on the growth track have already made investments to improve their digital offerings and recognize the need to align their perceived value with areas most difficult for robos to replace humans: advice and client relationships. We offered advice on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/what-the-rise-of-robos-should-teach-you-about-marketing-your-ria-firm/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   how to do this in a post published in October of 2014  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 2. Advisers on the Move. </h3><p> <br/> As Josh Brown artfully outlined on his blog,  <u>  <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/10/18/the-ballad-of-the-breakaway-broker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Reformed Broker  </a> </u> , many of the crisis-era retention deals handed out by wirehouses expired this year or are about to shortly. This frees up more brokers to make their own breakaway move. At the same time, reports are in that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/09/02/advisor-ma-on-a-tear-in-2015-schwab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 may be the best year to date for total reported RIA transactions  </a> </u> .</p><p> The transaction advisory firm ECHELON PARTNERS offered this to WealthManagement.com during its annual conference in September: &ldquo;While two industry studies suggest an average of 46 deals per year since 2000, true volume is likely three to 10 times this amount given all the unreported deals.&rdquo; This speaks to the reality that deal-making is robust and more advisers will be involved in transactions.</p><p> Amid recruitment wars M&amp;A, and the reality that as some businesses close or divest themselves of their wealth management business, advisers will evaluate their options ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/stifel-to-buy-barclays-u-s-wealth-management-ops-1433766107?alg=y\" target=\"_blank\">   see Barclays&rsquo; sale of their unit to Stifel  </a> </u> ). This creates a perfect storm where more advisers will not only be changing how they deliver financial advice, but where they do that.</p><p> Our point of view is that there will continue to be dislocations that create a flow of advisers in transition &ndash; either looking for a better platform from which they can serve their clients, or an opportunity to improve their own independence and wealth building capabilities. More than ever, the importance of social networking and the development of personal brands will help these advisers be successful in their moves.</p><h3> 3. ETFs Surge and AUM Fees Come Under Pressure. </h3><p> <br/> There have been numerous reports that have shown the correlation of relatively low fees to better investment performance. In 2010, Morningstar released  <a href=\"http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=347327\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   a study  </u> </a>  that looked at fees and how they corresponded with investor performance. But, as much as some pundits like to suggest, it&rsquo;s not all the fault of ETFs that investors are demanding they pay less for their investments. The fact that ETFs have surged from $1.3 trillion in global AUM in 2010 to $2.97 trillion as of October 2015 can only be partially to blame for what has now become a multi-faceted attack on fees.</p><p> Forces range from the abundance of low-cost investment products that are now available, to the disruption of the 1 percent fee paradigm fostered by the robo-adviser trend. Also at play is the increased regulatory scrutiny on advisers&rsquo; compensation, all of which have worked together to challenge the profitability of the RIA business. Read the piece from Joe Duran, CEO of United Capital, published earlier this month that touches on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20151013/BLOG16/151019977/4-ways-the-labor-department-is-about-to-rock-our-world\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   these issues  </a> </u> .</p><p> Duran himself forecasted this issue back in 2011 in an article with RIABiz where he said, <strong>  &ldquo;For advisors to survive they&rsquo;ll have to work twice as hard for half of the money.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> From our perspective, we continue to hear from growth-minded RIA firms who want to adapt their own communications and brand strategy to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these sea-changing trends. They&rsquo;re looking to galvanize PR campaigns and social media strategies that position their firm among those that will be winners, providing differentiated services at a premium price point. These RIA firms are hungry to have a seat at the table in merger discussions and they want to be seen as an employer of choice when newly minted college graduates or prospective career changers come calling, looking to take advantage of the opportunity in the business. And, they see the need to connect with an audience that is becoming increasingly hard to engage.</p>",

    "content": "<p> This blog comes to you from Jay Shetty. Jay is a consultant in one of the leading technology, outsourcing and consulting firms. He is also CEO of Urban-Monk.com, and a millennial. Jay and I became friends online through twitter. We have met in person a few times since, and I am always impressed by his contribution and dialogue. He has taught me a lot. </p><p> I invited Jay to address this 'millennial fever' - gripping many a conversation - as I think it is more compelling to understand the millennial mind through the thoughts and perspective of a millennial. I am Gen X - The 'Baby Busters' - and my lot are a rather cynical generation. We created grunge music to express our frustration at the idealism of the Boomers. Did anyone care to thank us for that?</p><p> The following is Jay's own words, unedited by me. Feel free to continue the discussion with him on twitter  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jshetty1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @Jshetty1   </u> </a></p><p> Enjoy!</p><p>  </p><h3> The popularization of millennials</h3><p> <br/> In May of 2013, the Time magazine cover read &ldquo;The Me Me Me Generation. Millennials are lazy, entitled narcissists who still live with their parents. Why they&rsquo;ll save us all.&rdquo; No generation has been as publicly insulted, admired, misunderstood, and examined as the millennials. This comes as no surprise considering by 2025, millennials will make up as much as 75% of the global workforce. Born between 1980-1999, the millennial generation has been popularized by the rise of Mark Zuckerberg and companies like Facebook, the first major internet start-up whose core group of founders are millennials.</p><p> If each generation has a personality, you may say that the baby boomer (1946-1964) is the idealist, shaped by JFK and MLK. Generation X (1965-1979) is the skeptical independent shaped by the PC. Generation Y, or millennial, is the connected, diverse collaborator shaped by 9/11, social networking and the recession.</p><p> As an icebreaker at a recent event I attended, I was asked to name a weakness I had compared to the rest of my peer population. My answer was taking selfies. It has become the defining trademark of my generation, the ability to manoeuvre your arm (or selfie stick) almost robotically to get a perfect shot. And it is this perception of a millennial that shapes today&rsquo;s discussions on how to understand their mind. What are the first thoughts that come to your mind when you hear the term &ldquo;millennial&rdquo;? Whether it is progressive, collaborative and innovative, or sheltered, entitled and underemployed, trends suggest it is a paradoxical generation.</p><h3> The great divide</h3><p> <br/> Millennials are famous for being inseparable from their phones, but 51% surveyed said they prefer to talk with their co-workers face to face. They&rsquo;re also more loyal than given credit for. An unexpected 16% anticipate staying with their current job the rest of their career and 80% believe they will stay with four or fewer companies.</p><p> Beyond.com carried out research that highlighted the great divide between how millennials describe themselves and how HR professionals describe millennials. 65% of millennials described themselves as people-savvy but only 14% of HR professionals view them to be. 86% of millennials claim to be hardworking whereas only 11% of HR professionals believe they are. These are workplace perceptions that millennials need to rise above. It also shows how far we are from understanding the millennial mind. The most surprising statistic is that 35% of millennials believe they are tech-savvy as opposed to 86% of HR professionals who believe they are.</p><h3> The millennial as an individual </h3><p> <br/> It is quite ironic that the majority of commentators on millennial leadership are not millennials. Several speakers and writers talk about millennials as if they&rsquo;re a group of people who think and act exactly the same as each other. The label assumes they have no individual needs, preferences or traits.</p><p> To engage millennials effectively two changes are critical. The first is treating them as an individual like everyone else in the organization, observing their particular strengths and giving them projects accordingly. The second is giving millennials leadership roles. In my opinion a company that is serious about investing in its young workforce will select outstanding millennials and give them the opportunity to make decisions about employee engagement. Several companies say they are tailoring their practices towards millennials but hesitate to give them a position.</p><h3> The millennial worker  </h3><p> <br/> This is an area that I feel organisations are struggling with. It stems from the earlier point about not understanding millennials as individuals. A millennial branding report [DS1] found 45% of millennials would choose workplace flexibility over pay. This may be true but it cannot assume that all millennials a) prefer freedom in their work, or b) will perform better with freedom in their work.</p><p> Having worked alongside several millennials I have noticed some are structured performers and others are smart creatives. Some millennials still prefer a structured day with clearly outlined tasks and deliverables. Others prefer spontaneity, collaboration and inventing new processes. Does this mean that the latter is more of a millennial? I believe it suggests there are particular types of millennials who have more entrepreneurial flair but this is true of specific groups in every generation.  </p><h3> The millennial consumer</h3><p> <br/> Surprisingly, I believe companies know more about the millennial as a consumer than as a worker. This is probably because the customer is more directly linked to sales targets. Brands have become very effective in selling to millennials and building relationships with them.</p><p> Millennials claim that they aren&rsquo;t influenced at all by advertising, with only 1% surveyed stating that a compelling advertisement would make them trust a brand more. Their trust belongs in their online networks. 33% of millennials rely mostly on blogs before they make a purchase, compared to fewer than 3% for TV news, magazines and books. A couple of weeks ago I wanted to go to the cinema but didn&rsquo;t know what to see. I asked the question on Facebook and within 24 hours I had 70 comments&rsquo; worth of recommendations from my friends. Needless to say the movies were great.</p><p> A good example of how a brand used social media was John Lewis for Christmas 2014. For the first time ever their Christmas advert was released on YouTube before television. I viewed the advert just after 48 hours of it being online. The star of the advert was Monty the penguin and he was being sold in 3 sizes. The large size around 3ft tall was &pound;90, medium size was &pound;35 and small size was &pound;12. Being a fantastic boyfriend I chose to try to purchase the smallest cuddly toy and saw it was out of stock. I then checked the medium and large sizes and they were sold out too! Not only had Monty the penguin sold out but his partner Mable was all gone too. All after just 48 hours! I heard from source that John Lewis had drummed up so much demand that some people were selling Monty for up to &pound;1000 on Amazon.  </p><h3> Are you a millennial?</h3><p> <br/> Being a millennial is about a mindset &ndash; less defined by age and social background. I know several baby boomer and Gen X individuals with the so-called traits of millennials. These are the people who are avid consumers of Netflix and sometimes embarrassingly Snapchat as well. Several executives that I coach are extremely tech savvy and have even taught me a thing or two. The Pew Research Center has developed a 14-question quiz from which they tell you how &ldquo;millennial&rdquo; you are on a scale from 0 to 100. I am not convinced it is entirely accurate, but 57% of millennials play more for the competition, so at least those will enjoy it.  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> To attract new clients, you have to establish why you are different. Beyond why you provide a solution the prospect needs, establish why it would be in their best interest to choose you over all the other advisors they could choose from.</h3><p> <br/> And when you talk about your differences, using the words your clients use will do a better job of communicating than your words. One of the biggest mistakes in advisor marketing is developing your messages yourself and not involving your clients. <strong>  That's one of the main reasons a client advisory board such a good idea. </strong> Gathering clients together for a facilitated group conversation is a more effective way of understanding your value and your difference. When advisors describe their value and their difference without the clients input, they very often miss the mark.</p><p> Beyond knowing what to communicate is choosing which words to use. Advisor marketing tends to be chock full of words advisors like to use, but the words I hear from clients are often different. You say \"peace of mind\" but they probably say \"feeling organized\" or \"comfortable&rdquo; or \"feeling like we understand that.\" You might say \"our disciplined investment strategy\" but they might say \"watching out for the risks.\"</p><p> Maybe even more important than the words themselves, people evaluate the source of the information when they get told something. Your prospects expect you to promote yourself and so they consider comments from existing clients to be more credible than what you might say about yourself. Now, this can be tricky territory because of the prohibition on testimonials. If you avoid attributing comments to any individual and avoid making them overtly promotional, I believe you can utilize this approach. So, for example, rather than saying &ldquo;We are excellent at retirement planning&rdquo; you might say &ldquo;Our clients tell us that our process made them feel much better prepared for retirement.&rdquo;</p><p> Your brand is not what you say it is - your brand is what people say about you. To effectively communicate your value and your difference, let your brand do the speaking.</p>",

    "title": "Cold Calling Is NOT Dead — Pick up the Phone!",
    "link": "cold-calling-is-not-dead-pick-up-the-phone",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> <strong>  The Fear of Cold Calling </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  It's real. Cold Calling is scary to most sales people. BUT, contrary to popular belief and many articles written on that topic, Cold Calling is NOT dead. </strong> Just because social media can provide some (and the keyword here is some) valuable information and leads doesn't mean that we don't need to pick up the phone any more.</p><p> In a consultative sales environment, phone conversations are still a very effective way to develop new business. The good news is that Cold Calling has many benefits that you might not have thought of:</p><li> It keeps us sharp!</li><li> It requires that you are at your best.</li><li> When cold calling, you can&rsquo;t rely on the rapport that you have developed with your existing customers. So your sales and service skills have to be on high alert. <br/>  </li><p> The skills we use in Cold Calling help us with all of our sales and service interactions as well. It&rsquo;s somewhat similar to an athlete&rsquo;s world. The weight-lifting and drills they go through can be excruciating at times, but in the end their overall performance improves!</p><p> So, to be good at Cold-Calling, you need to Plan Ahead (= Pre-Call Planning) and Practice!</p><h3> Have a Plan (or Plans) in Place!</h3><p> <br/> The main motivating idea behind Pre-Call Planning is that customers will not always reveal needs, so we have to strategically ask questions to uncover them. </p><p> We should always be thinking, &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;  If you wait until the customer has a specific need, then the opportunity may come too late, or it may end up a bidding war with competition. </p><p> Sometimes customer needs are obvious and most often they need to be developed. </p><p> When you can uncover customer needs that they have not considered, you position yourself as a valued business partner. </p><p> Also, for all the times we arrive in someone&rsquo;s voicemail box, be sure to have a plan for leaving a voice mail! Don't ramble on, be natural and as conversational as possible, but convey your message sharply and concisely. You will find that thinking through the process and having a plan, rather than dialing for dollars will help you manage the fear. It will also help you anticipate objections. I am not recommending a script here, I am recommending a plan, and outline, or a cue card (link to our Cue Card and Directions), because following an exact script might make you sound (you guessed it!) scripted.</p><h3> Research, Research, and Research</h3><p> <br/> The better you are prepared before picking up the phone, the higher your chances that your prospect will listen. As long as you are targeted in your approach and you know who your ideal prospects are there is really nothing to fear than fear itself.</p><h3> Be Personal and Professional</h3><p> <br/> There is this common expectation that sales people should be aggressive. In my experience, the more gentle, consultative and professional you are, the higher your success rate will be. </p><p> Never treat anybody in any way other than the way you would like to be treated. And respect your prospect&rsquo;s time.</p><h3> Lead with Value</h3><p> <br/> Focus on the value your products or solutions might bring to your prospect. You will have time to talk about features and benefits of your offering, if your prospects show interest in details. Understand that not everyone wants to know or needs to know all the great features and benefits you have to offer if they see the value first.</p><p> People who have worked through our Consultative Sales Certification program know the difference. You only have a short period of time (in New York usually only a couple of seconds) to get your point across. What is the value your prospect will gain when working with you? Is it saved time or money, or the ability to increase revenue? In the end, that's what they care about most. (Feature/Benefits link &ndash; just the half page overview of what is value)</p><h3> Be Relevant and Stay Honest</h3><p> <br/> It doesn't make sense to talk prospects into a need. Your product or solution has to be a fit, otherwise you will waste your time, and your prospect's time. If you find out that there is no current need, leave a good impression, try to be helpful if possible (by maybe providing an alternative solution or referring to another organization = you&rsquo;ll surely raise your reputation!) and get permission to stay in touch.</p><h3> Let Your Prospects Do the Talking</h3><p> <br/> Don't rattle off a pitch, but start with an introduction and then shift into asking questions that relevant to your prospect&rsquo; business and industry. The more information you can extract from your prospects (personal or professional), the better equipped you will be to follow up and build a relationship. Use open-ended questions and try to avoid questions that will yield a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Let your prospect do the talking.</p><h3> Pick up the Phone!</h3><p> <br/> Yes, that&rsquo;s right - just do it! (After you&rsquo;ve done your Pre-Call Planning!) There is just no way around it. Well scripted and written e-mails go a long way, but if you are selling in a consultative sales environment well-planned and executed phone calls will give you your biggest return on investment. It will pay off!</p><p> And finally, get help! There is many coaches out there who are able to help. Prospecting, cold calling, like all the other sales aspects can be learned. We teach sales professionals every day, even the ones who are very afraid. And remember, practice not only makes perfect &ndash; Practice makes Permanent!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> When you hear the words &ldquo;Robo-Advisor,&rdquo; what do you think of&hellip;? The Matrix?</h3><p> <br/> And does &ldquo;Financial Advisor&rdquo; conjure up a swaggering DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street? Or maybe someone in a Brooks Brothers suit, describing products you barely understand?</p><p> If you said yes to either, you&rsquo;re not alone.</p><p> One common fear about the new wave of robo-advisory firms is that, once you take the <strong>  &ldquo;red pill&rdquo; </strong> and dive in, you&rsquo;re no longer in control. You&rsquo;ve turned your money over to a mysterious series of algorithms with no human in sight to help you guide it.</p><p> Many investors &ndash; particularly younger ones &ndash; are also put off by the idea of bespoke-suited advisors from traditional firms who are trying to up-sell them investments and insurance products with hefty fees and commissions. And even if they were to opt for the more conservative <strong>  &ldquo;blue pill,&rdquo; </strong> traditional advisories are often not interested in speaking with them because they can&rsquo;t make the hefty minimum investment.</p><p> While there is some truth to both stereotypes, there are also big shifts going on in the financial industry that make this a great time to take advantage of both a new breed of independent financial advisor and the efficiencies that targeted robo-platforms can provide.</p><p> Here are the differences &ndash; as well as drawbacks and benefits &ndash; in a nutshell:</p><h3> <strong>  Robo-Advisors: </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Pros: </strong></p><li> Inexpensive compared to full-service portfolio management</li><li> Lower barrier to entry: lower initial investment requirements</li><li> Democratic: all clients benefit equally from algorithmic decisions, not just the big investors</li><li> Data-driven: driven by numbers, trends, and deep data &ndash; not emotions <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons: </strong></p><li> Limited scope: robo-advisor only handle investment management, not comprehensive financial planning</li><li> Generic: they categorize you using broad-stroke demographic &ndash; not individualized- goal and risk-tolerance profiling to build your portfolio</li><li> Automatic: selling or &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo; can be triggered by pre-set formulas at times that you might be wiser to stay put</li><li> Limited opportunities: many robo-firms currently have a limited or &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; set of funds and options you can invest in</li><li> Impersonal: no human interaction for questions regarding your individual investment portfolio <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Traditional Financial Advisory Firms </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Pros: </strong></p><li> Someone who picks up the phone when you call or will see you when you make an appointment.</li><li> Flexible: can make real-time decisions about what&rsquo;s right for you or when to buy or sell not rather than being locked into formulas.</li><li> Multi-layers of expertise to call on <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Cons: </strong></p><li> Barrier to entry: many traditional advisories have high minimums and confusing requirements and may only offer enhanced services to &ldquo;premium&rdquo; clients</li><li> Conflict of interest: many advisories have a &ldquo;corporate agenda&rdquo; to promote certain products, or they follow a [Suitability Standard] that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily put the clients&rsquo; interests above their own</li><li> Change resistant: larger organizations can be &ldquo;too big for their own good,&rdquo; and slow to incorporate new tech or new processes that add value for their clients or address clients&rsquo; individual needs.</li><li> Limited customization: established firms frequently use old-school models of demographics, risk allocation, and target dates without factoring in what makes each client unique</li><li> Impersonal: while customer service is available, traditional firms often don&rsquo;t truly &ldquo;meet you where you are&rdquo; and customize services and portfolios for you unless you have a large portfolio <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Enter the New Breed </strong></h3><p> <br/> A growing number of independent financial advisors are disrupting the traditional model and starting to create a &ldquo;third way,&rdquo; hybrid advisories that strive to offer all the pros and &ndash; hopefully &ndash; none of the cons. They offer clients customized fee-only services &ndash; unhindered by corporate agendas &ndash; and with a lower minimum investment. At the same time they are able to incorporate the newest tech tools that not only make it easy for new clients to get started, but also offer fast, best-in-class investment management modeling to make faster decisions about managing investments.</p><p> Or, as Josh Brown so eloquently put it in  <u>  <a href=\"http://thereformedbroker.com/2015/10/18/the-ballad-of-the-breakaway-broker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a recent blog post  </a> </u> , &ldquo;&hellip;innovation and creative spirit is fleeing from the Old World to the new one.&rdquo;</p><p> So why haven&rsquo;t all advisors embraced the new technology to offer enhanced services to their clients? The three biggest reasons are inertia, inertia, and inertia. It&rsquo;s not easy to change entrenched business models, culture, and processes. Remember how Netflix caught the video rental business napping?</p><h3> <strong>  Why Not Just Go with a Robo-advisor? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Robo-advisors generally only offer investment management, not comprehensive, goal-oriented financial planning. While both investment advisors and robo-advisors can recommend investment direction, strategy, and allocation, a good financial advisor can help you identify goals, customize budgets and cash flow planning, and help you with insurance, credit, and debt management, things a robo-platform can&rsquo;t do.</p><p> The most important thing about the integration of new tech with personal attention and a customized plan is that a user-friendly tech interface can allow clients to manage all the pieces of their financial plans, from cash flow to 401Ks, while allowing an experienced advisor to monitor it and give clients a call when that advisor sees an opportunity, a red flag, or wants to check in about goals and direction.</p><p> These days, clients can see through the bespoke suits; what they&rsquo;re looking for is bespoke service. By embracing selected and appropriate technology, this new breed of independent financial advisors are able to offer all the &ldquo;pros,&rdquo; while creating a new model of more transparent, conflict-free financial management that&rsquo;s available to everyone who wants to set &ndash; an achieve &ndash; financial goals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In an effort to avoid a potentially imminent government shutdown, an 11th hour budget and debt-ceiling deal was passed by Congress and the Senate last week and simply awaits the President's signature, which is expected in the next day or two. <br/> <br/> Among the many components of this bill are significant changes to social security filing options. As a result, many of the favorable filing strategies to maximize lifetime social security benefits will be eliminated. Please note, however, that anyone currently receiving benefits based on these filing strategies will not be affected by these new social security filing rules. <br/> <br/> <strong>  The impending changes to social security filing strategies are without question the most significant changes since the \"Senior Citizens' Freedom To Work Act of 2000\". </strong> Although elimination of these Social Security filing strategies have often been characterized as \"closing loopholes for the rich\", <strong>  the reality is that the groups likely to be harmed the most will be lower and middle income families and women. </strong>   Here we go again!  Strangely enough, the government has also indicated that it actually doesn't expect to receive any meaningful savings from elimination of these (to date) \"little used\" filing strategies for at least 10 years. It appears to be more of a pre-emptive strike against the waive of baby boomers entering their social security filing years. <br/> <br/> So what were the biggest changes to the social security filing options? Basically, it was the elimination of the \"file and suspend\" and \"file and restrict\" strategies and also the extension of \"deemed filing\" from full retirement age (FRA) to age 70. The \"file and suspend\" option will end 6 months after the bill is passed. After that, if you voluntarily suspend your benefit, you will not be able to claim benefits based on anyone else's earnings record, and no one will be able to claim benefits on your record. <br/> <br/> This change will have a broad-reaching impact on how and when you can claim Social Security benefits. For example, you can no longer file and suspend to enable your spouse to file for a spousal benefit or to enable benefits for school-age children, since filing for your own retirement benefits is usually a pre-condition for starting \"family benefits\". <br/> <br/> The bill will also implement changes to a complex set of Social Security rules known as \"deeming\". In simple terms (prior to this bill), if you obtained your FRA and wanted to file for spousal benefits while deferring the start of your own benefits (so that your benefits could continue to increase in value) you could do so even if your own FRA benefit amount was greater than 50% of your spouse's FRA benefit amount. However, if you were between the age of 62 and your FRA, and if your own FRA benefit amount was greater than 50% of your spouse's FRA benefit amount then you would be required to take your own benefit (you would not be eligible for spousal benefits in that case). <br/> <br/> Under the new rules, deeming is extended from FRA to age 70. Therefore, if your own FRA benefit is greater than 50% of your spouse's FRA benefit you will no longer be eligible for spousal benefits. You can only file for your own benefit. This rule will also affects divorced spouse's, which could have a devastating affect on their lifetime benefits. <br/> <br/> Although these filing options are scheduled to be eliminated, there is currently a critical \"transition period\" where these generous filing strategies will still be available for new filers. This \"window of opportunity\" will be available for the next 6 months only. For those of you who are between the ages of 65 1/2- 70 it is critical that you contact a social security retirement income specialist to determine what your eligible benefits are. It is important to note that these special filing strategies could generate as much as $50,000-$300,000 in additional lifetime benefits for you from Social Security. <br/> <br/> In addition, for those of you who are between the ages of 62-70 as of 12/31/15, there may also still be some valuable opportunities to utilize special filing strategies before they are eliminated. Since Security Security remains one of the few pension benefits available to most Americans, it is more important than ever to review your filing options and make sure you obtain all your eligible benefits before your \"window of opportunity\" closes.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Approaching the checkout counter at a local store, I placed my items on the counter.</p><p> &ldquo;Will that be cash or credit card?&rdquo; the harried clerk asked.</p><p> &ldquo;Credit card,&rdquo; I answered.  A slight frown crossed his face.</p><p> &ldquo;Is that a problem?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Well, our credit card machine went down about an hour ago and I have to do it manually, if that&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m REALLY sorry!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;No worries, the world isn&rsquo;t coming to an end because of this.&rdquo;</p><p> As he took my card and started filling out the charge slip, referencing each entry with a &ldquo;cheat sheet,&rdquo; he was obviously flustered. A glint of sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p> I smiled and assured him that it was no problem.</p><p> &ldquo;There, I think that&rsquo;s it. I just have to call it in on the phone.&rdquo; His eyes rolled with impatient frustration.</p><p> &ldquo;You might want to put my name on the slip,&rdquo; I offered, smiling.</p><p> &ldquo;Oh yeah, thanks&hellip;&rdquo; His sweat level was now reaching Zumba class proportions.</p><p> After the &ldquo;ordeal&rdquo; was completed, he offered me several samples and thanked me profusely for my patience.</p><p> Walking out of the store, it struck me how much technology has changed and with it, our expectations. It was as if I&rsquo;d asked him to get up and change the channel on the television without a remote control.</p><p> Even as we quickly adapt to changes that make our life simpler, &ldquo;progress&rdquo; can make us less resilient.</p><p> He surely didn&rsquo;t display the ability to get through a minor glitch without going into &ldquo;flummox mode&rdquo; despite my best efforts to assure him that this wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world and I wasn&rsquo;t going to scream, carry on or threaten to take my business elsewhere.</p><p> Which brings me to the Dow. During the latest round of market volatility and fear-mongering headlines, investors had the opportunity to react out of fear, to flip out, to make hasty decisions or to do nothing. The people who sold when the Dow dipped&mdash;only to see it rise the next day&mdash;were left feeling frustrated and regretful.</p><p> Our human-ness relies on our ability to think and decide. It&rsquo;s a really good trait when applied to most situations. The problem with making buy-sell decisions in the stock market is that we are typically fooled by our beliefs.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at the facts:</p><li> US markets have been up for 6 years.</li><li> Certain foreign economies are currently in really bad shape, while others are going through their own cycles.</li><li> There are a lot of question marks about the future. <br/>  </li><p> Add up these factors and you can make whatever conclusions make sense to you. Maybe we&rsquo;re due for a correction, maybe this is just the end of summer doldrums, maybe this is the beginning of a recession, maybe this is just the start of the next rally, maybe oil prices will firm up and all our worst fears will be averted, maybe, maybe, maybe&hellip;</p><p> The fact is, the market will be what it will be without any help from you. And that any short-term decisions you make with long-term investments is more likely to be a mistake than a good decision.</p><p> So ignore the headlines, coffee shop talk, tweets and HuffPo stories predicting the end of world and roll with the punches. Like the broken credit card machine, the market doesn&rsquo;t always work the way you want it to.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s an exceptionally active time for the financial services world. No headline is fully dressed without the words &ldquo;merger&rdquo; or &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; attached to some of what once were the most exclusive names on the street. </strong> As the scale, resilience, and stability of &ldquo;boutique&rdquo; firms &ndash; such as what was Barclays, Credit Suisse, and now Deutsche Bank &ndash; come into question, advisors that work there are living in a world that becomes more uncertain with each day. Then a wirehouse or large regional firm swoops in &ndash; seeming to save the day &ndash; adding another layer of uncertainty and the possibility of a stay-worthy retention deal or a &ldquo;free pass&rdquo; to move on to something better.</p><p> What does an advisor at one of these firms do to solidify his future? Will a new name on a business card bring a host of bigger and better opportunities and solve for all that was previously wrong with his professional world?</p><p> Take Deutsche Bank and the latest rumors around sale of the wealth management unit to Raymond James. It&rsquo;s one that has some legs given RayJay&rsquo;s acquisition of Morgan Keegan and publicity stemming from CEO Paul Reilly&rsquo;s comments at the last analyst meeting characterizing the organization as being in &ldquo;acquisition mode.&rdquo;</p><p> As a Deutsche Bank advisor with high net worth clients, you may be wondering how the Raymond James name will resonate, which is a perfectly valid consideration. While Raymond James certainly has a robust platform and all the capabilities that the high net worth client needs, the name certainly has not been the go-to brand for the ultra-affluent.</p><p> So while Deutsche Bank advisors &ndash; along with their Credit Suisse and Barclays counterparts in similar positions &ndash; are questioning whether the cachet of the brand that their clients are accustomed to can be supported by a super-regional like Raymond James, a bigger issue for each advisor should circle around the &ldquo;free pass&rdquo; each has been given, allowing everyone to evaluate the waterfall of possibilities with fresh eyes and a sense of new beginning, whether or not a deal with any prospective acquirer coagulates. And, after doing one&rsquo;s due diligence, the $64,000 question should be,  &ldquo;Would I still choose my own firm or any firm that acquires it?&rdquo;</p><p> Truth be told, I think that as the landscape continues to evolve, it becomes clearer and clearer that boutique firms that lack scale are not the most stable choice for advisors. And we will continue to watch many of the super high-quality advisors that have long practiced in that space move on to scalable and more resilient models. Firms like Raymond James certainly fit the bill: a regional firm &ndash; with more than 4,000 advisors and a multi-channel association model &ndash; that has a strong belief that the advisor owns the client. In fact, they are the only firm on the street that writes into the contract of W2 employees that the employee owns his/her book.</p><p> Of course, it makes perfect sense to give your firm the opportunity to win you over, as a handsome retention package may be presented in return for your loyalty. The best advice I can offer is this: run parallel paths. Allow things to unfold at your own firm, evaluating any potential acquirer and the retention package being offered. At the same time, continue to explore the industry landscape for new models that have emerged and traditional firms that provide you with a better opportunity to build the business that will be best for you and your clients.</p><p> Ultimately, you have quite an opportunity before you&mdash;many will say it&rsquo;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. While your head may be spinning with uncertainty, take a deep breath; the only bad choice is one of letting opportunity pass you by. This is your chance to choose how and where you can live out your best business life. So, be fearless&hellip;explore and conquer.</p>",

    "link": "5-tips-for-writing-something-that-matters",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> What does it mean to write something that matters?  Does it matter to write something that matters?  There does seem to be an awful lot of bad content out there.  Do people really care if it&rsquo;s actually good or not?  Yes!  The answer is YES!  It does matter and your audience DOES care if you&rsquo;re spoon feeding them crap.  Don&rsquo;t put crappy content out there unless you want your customers to think you and your business are crappy.  Write something that matters so that your clients know that they matter.</p><p> I can vividly remember sitting at conferences where &ldquo;experts&rdquo; would talk about quantity over quality.  In fact, just last year, someone from one of those marketing automation companies said that you needed to have a minimum of 7,000 pieces of content a month if you were even going to make a bleep on the internet radar.  So many businesses panic at this notion of needing to be putting content out there for the sake of putting content out there, that they start subscribing to those canned content services (there&rsquo;s one for every industry).  The result is that companies that take this short-cut wind up having the same content as the next guy and the guy after that, and even worse, they completely miss the amazing opportunity to add value to their clients and connect with them in an authentic way through their own brand voice.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are five tips that can help you write something that matters: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Audience, Audience, Audience!  </h3><p> Never forget to whom you are writing. Write to your audience, not Google.  I also encourage you to go deeper than thinking demographics, &ldquo;I am writing to C-suite executives.&rdquo; Instead, think of someone very specific that fits inside your broader audience, &ldquo;I am writing to my buddy Bill; he is a CIO at a large tech company.&rdquo;  If you are writing something to someone specifically, it will help your writing feel more personalized and targeted to your overall intended audience.</p><h3> 2. Listen first and listen well. </h3><p> What does your audience want to know?  Sure, you have lots you would like to say about you and your company. I caution against writing about how awesome you and your business are.  Instead, ask yourself: What are the questions your audience is asking your customer service representatives? Do they share concerns they have during client meetings? Have you looked into the  <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner\" target=\"_blank\">  popular search queries in Google </a>  for your industry? Listen to your audience and get inspired to write about what they care about most as it relates to your industry.</p><h3> 3. Applicability. </h3><p> How will your audience use it? My local church has a saying, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t use it on Monday, we won&rsquo;t say it on Sunday.&rdquo;  This genius absolutely applies to content creation.  Be certain that whatever you create, that your readers will be able to take something away from it and apply it to their own situation.  Moreover, if your readers find that what you&rsquo;ve created is useful, they are more inclined to share it with their friends and contacts.  <a href=\"http://jonahberger.com/books/contagious/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (Learn more about creating contagious content from professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Jonah Berger here.) </a></p><h3> 4. Write About Something You Care About. </h3><p> Writing about a topic that personally interests you will allow for unbridled writing. When you are able to share your thoughts and insights on an issue or topic that you know well, your writing has a way of showcasing its best form.  You won&rsquo;t feel constrained in your efforts to write something that matters when you write about what you know.</p><h3> 5. Be Authentic. </h3><p> Writing content is your opportunity to share your voice and your perspective with your audience.  Let your writing showcase your personality. Your clients are more likely to meet you online first before they ever meet you in person.  With so much content out there competing for their attention, the way you write (versus what you are writing about) can help you differentiate yourself and it invites your customers to feel like they know you before they&rsquo;ve had a chance to meet you. Many people will be writing about the same topics you are, so make sure you remain authentic in your content creation always.</p><p> May you always be able to write something that matters to your audience, as well as to yourself.  Happy writing!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Christopher Burgess </u>  | <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/red_folder\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Red Folder  </a> </u></p><p> Do you &ldquo;live&rdquo; online? Who doesn&rsquo;t? Whether you&rsquo;re online for personal or business purposes, you have a digital footprint, and this online presence has needs of its own. In 2013, McAfee conducted a survey to try and determine the value of our  <u>  <a href=\"https://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/digital-assets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   digital legacy and digital assets  </a> </u> . The results of the survey showed, the on average our online footprint carried a value of approximately $35,000 (in 2013 &ndash; no doubt more now).</p><p> Those who blog know their blog has personal value inherent in the sharing of knowledge, but what of the fiscal value of this digital asset?  Is there a way to calculate the value of a blog? Yes, there is. &ldquo; <u>  Blog Calculator </u> &rdquo; has created a nifty algorithm which generates a hypothetical value of your blog.  The calculator asks a number of questions,  which once answered does it&rsquo;s magic and pops out a blog&rsquo;s value.</p><p> While the answer provided by this site&rsquo;s algorithm may be subjective, and open to interpretation (like the value of your car or home), it serves to demonstrate  <u>  your blog is a digital asset </u>  with intrinsic value. Therefore, like any other asset, you have to consider the disposition of the asset should you become incapacitated or die.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20average%20digital%20legacy%20is%20valued%20at%20more%20than%20%2435%2C000&amp;via=red_folder&amp;related=red_folder&amp;url=https://wp.me/p6NjMz-ZP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The average digital legacy is valued at more than $35,000  </a> </u></p><h3> 1 &ndash; Disposition of  your blog</h3><p> <br/> The first decision to make is whether or not you want to keep the blog up and running if you are unable to do so yourself due to illness, accident or you&rsquo;ve passed. Even if you desire this portion of your digital legacy to be shuttered, you should put forward a plan for  <u>  your trusted designee </u>  to follow.</p><h3> 2 &ndash; Your designee</h3><p> <br/> Selecting someone to handle things for you is no small task. Here at Red Folder, we recommend the designee be an individual with whom you have a great deal of trust. As they will be following through with your choices concerning the disposition of the blog.</p><h3> 3 &ndash; The administrative tail</h3><p> <br/> Those who blog, and there are millions of you (e.g.,  <u>  <a href=\"http://yoast-mercury.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2012/04/wordpress-stats-infographic-yoast1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   75+ million using WordPress  </a> </u>  according to Yoast) know that the administrative tail to your endeavor is long. Your instructions to your designee should contain the names of any blog-partners you currently have as well as guest bloggers, contributors or other site owners.</p><p> In addition, including the administrative permissions associated with your blog, unique to your hosting service, such as access credentials,  <a href=\"http://www.senioronlinesafety.com/ncsam-2013-tip-21-two-factor-authentication/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   two-step authentication  </u>  , </a>  challenge questions should also be memorialized. You will also want to detail, any monetary arrangements which involve the blog, is the blog syndicated, have advertising revenue or associated with affiliate programs. And you don&rsquo;t want to forget to provide access to the social media accounts associated with the blog &ndash; Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, etc. These too are a part of your digital legacy. </p><p>  </p><br /><h3> 4 &ndash; Your directive (wishes and desires)</h3><p> <br/> Within your instructions for your designee, discussion on how you wish things handled in the event of your passing is highly appropriate. Your instructions be they in written form, via a conversation or your Red Folder, provides you the opportunity to discuss, share and if necessary teach your designee what they need to know to maintain the blog.</p><p> In the example to the right, the  <u>  blogger provides instructions </u>   identifies the presence of his final post in the content management system&rsquo;s drafts folder. He also provides instructions if he is temporarily unavailable, more permanently incapacitated or has died. In addition, the blogger has identified the  <u>  domain and service provider where the blog is hosted </u> . For both, he provides information on where to find the passwords. If you decide to close it down, do you want the blog archived and saved to disk, cloud storage or put to another form of media?  </p><p> If you have children, will you want them to have this piece of your digital legacy as keepsake?</p><h3> 5 &ndash; Will the blog live on or die with a last post?</h3><p> <br/> While planning for anything involving your own death can be stressful, remember the words of Gail Rubin, &ldquo;Talking about sex won&rsquo;t make you pregnant, talking about death won&rsquo;t make you die.&rdquo; Rubin shared these words during her Tedx-ABQ talk, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/r9qR4ZiGX2Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A Good Goodbye  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><p> The late  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.penmachine.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Derek K. Miller  </a> </u> , an icon within the Pacific Northwest and beyond, well known digital journalist and technologist, who approached his stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer wrote his  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.penmachine.com/2011/05/the-last-post\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   last blog in anticipation of his passing  </a> </u>  (Derek passed on May 3, 2011).  He left instructions for his last post to be activated, the day after his passing &ndash; his blog remains active today.</p><p> The beauty is, you decide, &ldquo;does my blog live, or does it die.&rdquo;</p>",

    "title": "Grow Great People If You Want To Grow A Great Business",
    "link": "grow-great-people-if-you-want-to-grow-a-great-business",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It is terribly simplified of course, but if you want to grow a great business then you need to grow some great people at some point in the process.  If we want to learn how to grow great people then it seems a good idea to think about how the people who have been doing it successfully for about 4,500 years have done it &ndash; year in; year out; with people from all walks of life.</p><h3> For thousands of years the military has been mastering the impossible.  They&rsquo;ve worked out how to take teenagers who are ordinarily unable to keep a bedroom tidy or speak in words of more than 2 syllables, and turn them into focussed professionals able to perform incredibly well under the most stressful conditions imaginable.  If the armed forces can take teenagers and turn them into leaders there must be something worth looking at in what they do.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s quite remarkable when you think about that transformation, and the way the military is able to consistently produce the same type of human performance results, almost regardless of what they are given to work with in the beginning.  As an ex-military person now involved in helping people develop themselves and their businesses, I am increasingly drawn to some some of the simple concepts which underpin much of the incredible transformation that the services are able to create in individuals.  There are 3 core attributes that the services try to instil, which are essentials for anyone wishing to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the growth of a practice and build a fabulous personal brand as well.</p><h3> The Misconception</h3><p> <br/> Before discussing these three attributes it is worth clarifying a common misconception about how the military develop people, as the misconception often carries through to how business owners try to develop their own practice.</p><p> A prevailing view from civilians is that the military is often focussed on creating some sort of herd or mob mentality, where there is a lead sheep.</p><p> It could not be less true.</p><p> The military is not typically interested in creating robots who obey commands without thought.  While there is always a clear chain of command and there is absolutely zero doubt about who is in charge of what at any given time, people are developed to be able to step up to command at the next level in the event of crisis. That is how &ldquo;the unit&rdquo;, or team, survives (if not thrives) when tested.  There is immense investment in developing competencies and leadership qualities beyond the current role.</p><p> The ideal therefore is to have individuals who are team-oriented and willing to suppress personal agenda&rsquo;s for the good of the group, but who are capable of stepping up as and when required.  This capability, together with rigorous ongoing training that simulates predictable crises and focusses upon developing competency and thoughtfulness when they occur, is what leads to sustained success in an organisation.  In other words, the secret to sustained success in the toughest of endeavours is creating leadership capability throughout the organisation.</p><h3> The Key Lessons for Business Leaders</h3><p> <br/> Taking the lessons first taught by the Sumerians in 2,500 B.C. and constantly refined on a daily basis around the world in the 4,500 years since then, results in us being able to identify 3 key attributes of good leaders. They are:</p><li> <strong>   Responsible  </strong></li><li> <strong>   Responsive  </strong></li><li> <strong>   Resilient  </strong> <br/>  </li><p> As a result of these 3 attributes they become  <strong>  Respected </strong> .</p><p> For anyone trying to grow a business beyond something which is just a job for the owner, there is a constant and ongoing need for leadership within the business. Leadership in the sense of creating the capability for every person in the organisation to be able to perform at their optimal level.  This is how we obtain genuine leverage in the business.  Getting our people to perform at their optimal level and take charge of their respective parts of the business is what free&rsquo;s the business owner to focus upon strategy and organisational development.</p><p> Some will argue that these are perhaps personal attributes that a person either has or does not have.  A person is resilient or is not, for example.</p><p> The reality is every human being is resilient, but to varying degrees.  What the military teaches us is that any individuals resilience can be strengthened and extended beyond what was initially thought possible through training and testing, and building self-confidence.  So regardless of what any individuals &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; is at the beginning, it can be developed further.  That is increasing someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;capability&rdquo;.</p><p> To develop great people we need to continually invest in training and growing their capability.  Begin by creating responsibility, and then continually investing in improving that ability to take charge of roles, projects, teams and whatever the business has thrown at it.</p><p> When we have developed people who are responsible they also learn how to be responsive.  Making good decisions under pressure and with limited time is a result of that training in capability and responsibility, and the self-confidence that is created as a result.</p><p> It is the self-confidence and continual testing that extends resilience &ndash; that ability to withstand the uncomfortable or unthinkable for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people.</p><p> With responsible and responsive people throughout the business, who have developed resilience, we have a business that has inherent leadership at every level.</p><p> It is upon such skills that entire empires are built.  We must be able to learn something from that.</p>",

    "title": "12 Tips To Sleep Soundly Every Night",
    "link": "12-tips-to-sleep-soundly-every-night",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Sleep issues can be devastating to overall health and well-being, as anyone who's suffered a night of tossing and turning knows. While it's frustrating to live with insomnia and other sleeping difficulties, there is hope! Here are 12 tips to help you get peaceful, blissful sleep:</p><h3> 1. Turn off the blue light one hour before bedtime.</h3><p> Blue light is the most disturbing light when trying to go to sleep because it immediately shuts down your production of melatonin, the major sleep hormone that we produce at night. Sources of blue light include computers, iPads, cellphones, video games, and television.</p><h3> 2. Avoid caffeine after noon.</h3><p> Many of us fail to realize how much  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mindbodygreen.com/tag/caffeine.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   caffeine  </a> </u>  can impair our ability to get to sleep and remain asleep. Most of us take four to six hours to metabolize caffeine. However, many of us may take much longer. Caffeine blocks the ability of a sleep-promoting chemical called adenosine to work. So think twice about that evening trip to a coffee shop or that dark piece of chocolate you crave.</p><h3> 3. Check that thermostat.</h3><p> Most  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8022726?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum\" target=\"_blank\">   studies demonstrate  </a> </u>  that room temperatures of between 62 and 70 degrees seem to work best for sleeping. The reason is that our core body temperature drops at night. In fact, this drop is a signal to the brain to sleep. A warm room can inhibit this process.</p><h3> 4. Avoid cured meats and aged cheeses such as Parmesan close to bedtime.</h3><p> Aged cheeses and cured meats contain an amino acid called tyramine. This amino acid, when ingested, increases the release of a hormone called norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is a wake-promoting hormone that is part of the fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system &mdash; certainly not something you want occurring when you're trying to fall asleep.</p><h3> 5. Eat sleep-promoting foods.</h3><p> Snacks that are high in tryptophan such as dairy products, cheese, nuts, seeds, and grains, when combined with complex carbohydrates such as whole-wheat toast or crackers, can encourage the onset of sleep. The release of insulin associated with the carbohydrates promotes the movement of tryptophan into the brain. Tryptophan is then converted to serotonin and melatonin, which are sleep-promoting neurotransmitters.</p><h3> 6. Park your worries in another room.</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t take your worries or your work into the bedroom. In my book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Soundly-Every-Night-Fantastic/dp/1936303728/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=mind0a3-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sleep Soundly Every Night, Feel Fantastic Every Day  </a> </u> , I describe a technique called constructive worrying. At least three hours before bed, write down your concerns and your solutions. Then put them in a desk drawer and leave them there for the night.</p><h3> 7. Make sure your alarm clocks are heard, but not seen.</h3><p> The alarm clock should be in your bedroom to wake you up in the morning. Anxious glancing followed by calculating and then ruminating about &ldquo;when will I get to sleep&rdquo; or &ldquo;how many hours of sleep do I have left&rdquo; is a major cause of insomnia. If you're having trouble getting to sleep, put that clock where it can be heard but out of sight.</p><h3> 8. Exercise regularly.</h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934815\" target=\"_blank\">   Study  </a> </u>  after  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25044598\" target=\"_blank\">   study  </a> </u>  has shown that those who exercise regularly go to sleep easier and sleep more soundly than their sedentary friends. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933083\" target=\"_blank\">   a very recent study  </a> </u>  has dispelled the myth about exercising too close to bedtime. In this study, even those who exercised close to bedtime slept better than those who did not.</p><h3> 9. Avoid excessive alcohol close to bedtime.</h3><p> Unfortunately, many alcoholics started out drinking to help them fall sleep. Although initially alcohol may induce sleep, as it leaves the body, it causes an increase in body temperature and triggers the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight). As a result, it hinders your ability to stay asleep, and as time passes, you require more and more each night to fall asleep &mdash; not a good formula for health or sleep.</p><h3> 10. Quiet please.</h3><p> If you're having trouble falling or staying asleep, it could be the noise. The noise might be coming from your snoring spouse or that loud music that your recently returned 28-year-old is playing. In any case, most of us need quiet to sleep. The remedy can be as simple as a good pair of custom earplugs or getting your spouse to see someone about that snoring &hellip; or in some cases, considering a bedroom divorce.</p><h3> 11. Check that mattress.</h3><p> An old mattress can be an unrecognized source of poor sleep. Most mattresses should be changed after seven years. With the new memory foam and air number mattresses, you can customize the degree of firmness to your comfort level.</p><h3> 12. Relax those muscles.</h3><p> In the book, I describe a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. It's a sequential tensing and relaxation of various muscle groups accompanied by rhythmic breathing. It is simple to learn and very effective. It accomplishes two things: One, by relaxing muscles, tension is relieved, which in turn relaxes the mind. Two, the very activity takes your mind off everything else and serves as a form of meditation.</p><p> These are just some of the things you can do to help your sleep. The crucial point is to realize how important sleep is to good mental and physical health. So please make sleep a priority.</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the best ways to be inclusive of diversity in the workplace is to <strong>  hear the thoughts, ideas, and feedback of others. </strong> This ensures that your business stays fresh and innovative when creating new or updating current products and services. We talk about listening to those of different genders, races, religions, and other backgrounds; these are the obvious diverse voices among us. But, we are also impacted in the workplace by different personalities.</p><p> <strong>  While extroverts are eager to share their ideas in meetings or group brainstorming sessions, introverts may not find voicing their opinions in group settings easy to do. </strong>  Sometimes introverts can be seen as uninterested or not as invested in the company&rsquo;s wellbeing because they&rsquo;re quieter than, and not as forthcoming with ideas as, their more vocal colleagues.</p><p> In Susan Cain&rsquo;s Huffington Post article, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/09/10/susan-cain-qa_n_8049360.html?utm_hp_ref=small-business&amp;ir=Small+Business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Insights for Introverts Who Want To Thrive In The Workplace  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; she offers different solutions to help introverts feel more comfortable and confident when sharing their ideas in different settings&mdash;from job interviews, to meetings. One tip Cain shares in the article is particularly helpful for inclusive leaders.</p><p> In meetings, where the objective of the meeting is to share information, <strong>  inclusive leaders can seek to gather information from introverted attendees by having everyone write down one or two ideas to share </strong> prior to the meeting, Cain suggests. Many people are uncomfortable with coming up with comments on the spot, and introverts often don&rsquo;t feel comfortable sharing their thoughts in these settings. Having people brainstorm one or two points prior to the start of the meeting can help to alleviate this anxiety, she says.</p><p> Then, she says, the meeting leader can go around the table and ask each person to share the feedback that they wrote down previously. This technique can help to keep extroverts from controlling the meeting, and will also encourage introverts to speak up and be heard.</p><p> Having one-on-one meetings with employees may also be a better platform for introverts than larger group meetings. <strong>  Let employees know that if they have ideas they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable sharing in meetings, they can always come to you after the meeting or later on in the day to talk about their ideas. </strong></p><p> Inclusive leaders take the time to evaluate and understand the different personalities in the office. A meeting may be a great place for extroverts to share ideas, but it isn&rsquo;t always the best platform for introverts. By only listening to the louder voices in the office, you might not be getting the ideas you need to keep your company growing. Creating a culture that encourages everyone to take part in shaping the future of the organization is key to business success.</p><p> <strong>  Be inclusive! </strong></p>",

For women with the same birth years, the share of 62-year-old claimers declined from 63 percent to 40 percent.</p><p> The Center also confirmed that more people are waiting to sign up for their benefits until after their full retirement age under the program, which is 66 for most baby boomers.

This way of looking at the data provided an accurate picture when each successive age group was roughly similar in size. But the picture became distorted as baby boomers moved through the pipeline and began turning 62 in larger numbers.</p><p> In the new analysis, which is based on unpublished data from the U.S. Social Security Administration, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IB_15-8.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Center  </a> </u>  was able to track how many people born in  each individual year  are claiming once they turn 62, then 63, then 64 &ndash; and up to age 70.</p><p> While recent trends indicate significant progress in delaying claiming, well over one-third of boomers are still signing up for Social Security at 62. What remains unclear is whether those who choose to do so can afford to lock in the much smaller monthly benefit that comes with claiming early.</p>",

In one company I worked with, there were silos within silos. Members of one department did not take into consideration the needs and stresses of the members of another department. It seemed as if everyone was working independently for a different organization. Even individual areas spoke to each other with little regard for challenges. Being  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2012/12/09/what-is-the-right-amount-of-empathy-for-leadership/#sthash.yY47Cr9J.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   empathetic  </a> </u>  is essential to create engagement and commitment.</p><h3> CLEAR ROLE DEFINITIONS</h3><p> <br/> To perform our best, we each need to know the responsibilities and expectations for our jobs. It&rsquo;s always helpful to develop a list of tasks and who will be in charge of each one. Be as specific as possible and work together to create the descriptions.</p><h3> VALUE FOR EACH CONTRIBUTOR</h3><p> <br/> No matter the level, no matter the title, no matter the role. Each team member should be seen as valuable and critical to the project.</p><li> Offer praise and appreciation often</li><li> Take time when further explanations are needed</li><li> Meet to keep up with progress, keeping everyone in the information loop</li><li> Avoid judgmental words like: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your input is not helpful.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> COMPLETE BIG PICTURE UNDERSTANDING</h3><p> <br/> When team members have a clear understanding of what is being accomplished and why, they are more likely to stay focused and offer relevant suggestions. In one organization I worked with employees were frustrated that different teams seemed to get different treatment. When senior leadership rolled out the reasons behind their decisions, all the teams felt more interconnected and on the same mission.</p><h3> STEPPING UP TO LEAD</h3><p> <br/> One of the exercises I use in my team building program involves putting together five square puzzles. It&rsquo;s a fascinating study in how teams organize and usually the leader changes during the activity depending on what expertise is required. The same happens on our teams. Team members need to  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/01/12/when-should-leaders-step-up-or-step-aside/#sthash.O5hoR8vR.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   step up  </a> </u>  to lead when their particular talents are needed. When that happens, the team is always being steered by just the right individual.</p><p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Leaders+take+turns+leading+on+high+performing+teams.&amp;via=TerriKlass&amp;related=TerriKlass&amp;url=http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/11/02/language-of-a-high-performing-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Leaders take turns leading on high performing teams  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  What strategies and language do you use to cultivate a high performing team? </strong></p>",

    "link": "7-critical-conversations-to-master-as-a-financial-advisor",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Bill Bachrach</p><p> There are vital ingredients necessary to engage people in the conversations that turn leads into prospects, prospects into clients, and clients into people who take action on your advice and refer you to their friends, family, and colleagues. These vital ingredients are easy to understand but hard to master.</p><p> Let's first examine the vital ingredients, The 7 Critical Conversations.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #1: Mastery of the first conversation.</h3><p> Every future Ideal Client relationship starts with a stranger. However you choose to prospect and market, your ability to engage strangers is critical to your success. How do you engage a person or couple, in any situation or environment, in a way that inspires them to want to talk to you again without coming across like a schmucky financial salesperson trolling for business? This is a skill that anyone who is dedicated can master. It&rsquo;s about asking the right questions, listening with empathy, hearing what&rsquo;s most meaningful, important, significant, and compelling to them, and then being able to make an offer to take a simple first step that&rsquo;s relevant FOR THEM.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #2: Mastery at scheduling the appointment.</h3><p> How do you inspire people, both spouses, to come to your office with all of their financial documents? Given all the demands on their time and all of their options for getting financial education, information, advice, and products&hellip; what will be the reason they agree to take the time to get their financial documents together, carve time out of their busy work schedules or retirement activities to come see you? It won&rsquo;t happen by accident. It&rsquo;s a skill that can be mastered. Scripted, practiced, and executed in the real world.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #3: Mastery at opening the first face-to-face meeting is vital.</h3><p> People have embedded in their subconscious minds an imaginary trust dial. And everything you say and do moves the needle on the trust dial one direction&hellip; or the other. We&rsquo;re talking about the first 45 to 60 seconds. It HAS to be scripted. It has to be scripted word for word and you have to practice those words over and over and over again until you are brilliantly effective. Not just at delivering the words, but with the right tonality, the right facial expressions, and with a totally trustworthy way of being. Do you remember that scene from the movie Jerry McGuire where Renee Zelweiger&rsquo;s character said, &ldquo;You had me at hello?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s your goal: to have them at hello.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #4: Mastery at making an emotional connection in the face-to-face interview.</h3><p> What follows the opening is a conversation, with each spouse, about their personal core values. Core values are the emotional why that drive all of their important decisions. Most FAs jump too quickly into asking clients about their goals without laying an emotional foundation of why they want what they want. The skill to set this emotional foundation is crucial. Why always precedes what.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #5: Mastery at helping people define clear targets with specific dates and amounts of money wanted.</h3><p> Their goals are the tangible what they want built on the foundation of their values. You can develop the skill to lead an emotionally compelling and inspiring conversation about their goals. It&rsquo;s a skill, maybe even an art form. And it&rsquo;s learn-able.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #6: Mastery at financial benchmarking.</h3><p> The skill to handle their financial documents with finesse&hellip; without getting deep into the details or the irrelevant stories about the history of each document. This is a 10-minute benchmarking exercise that establishes their current position on the road to achieving their most important goals and fulfilling their most deeply held values. Sometimes the skill to be developed is learning what NOT to say. It&rsquo;s okay to have a thought you don&rsquo;t express, right? Otherwise, you end up with LONG meetings that deter people from hiring you. Remember the confused mind says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think it over.&rdquo; Why do they have to think it over? Because there was too much detail to make a decision right now. We value people who simplify our lives and save us time. This is a skill you can master.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #7: Mastery to articulate your value promise and make your offer for them to become a client.</h3><p> How succinctly and effectively can you articulate your value promise? How well can you answer the two simple client questions, &ldquo;How much does it cost?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;What do I get?&rdquo; without over-explaining the details or giving a lecture that would only interest a graduate student in economics, but bores your prospects and clients to tears. If you &ldquo;had them at hello&rdquo; you can easily lose them here. When this face-to-face meeting is done effectively you much more often hear, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get started&rdquo; and you seldom hear, &ldquo;We need to think it over.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The collective mastery of these 7 Critical Conversations will give you the skill and the confidence to talk to anyone, any time, anywhere&hellip; </strong> The skill and confidence to speak with any one, any time, anywhere is how you get the clients you really want, build the business you really want and live the life you really want.</p><p> The most brilliant financial planning technician, the most savvy investment advisor, the most talented wealth manager, or the most knowledgeable insurance, estate planning, or tax expert does not stand a chance of building an Ideal Clientele without a high level of skill and confidence with these 7 Critical Conversations. </p><p> <strong>  With stronger conversations, you will thrive in the new world of regulatory change, digital advisors, and confidently grow your business regardless of any disruption that comes your way. </strong></p>",

    "link": "too-many-things-in-the-world-of-work-still-suck",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I am still reeling from the amazing experience that was  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/ted/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TED at IBM  </a> </u> . For those of you unfamiliar, it is a co-branded and promoted event by TED and IBM designed to showcase some of the brightest minds in the world. One of the speakers that resonated with me was  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nireyal?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nir Eyal  </a> </u> . His talk was about &ldquo;Habit-Forming Behaviors&rdquo;. One of his slides read: &ldquo;Too Many Things Still Suck&rdquo;. This sentiment stuck with me beyond the awesomeness of the conference because the statement is 100% true.It made me think about the world of work and the aspects of work that are screaming for change. With our 71% disengaged workforce, we are tasked with herding &ldquo;The Walking Dead&rdquo; on a daily basis. As HR practitioners, it&rsquo;s our duty to ensure that our zombies&rsquo; workers are providing the required outputs needed for our organizations to run and remain profitable.</p><h3> <strong>  What things still suck in the world of work? Let me count the ways. </strong></h3><li> ​According to a recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/10/20/the-gender-pay-gap-widens-as-mens-earnings-grow-twice-as-fast-as-womens/\" target=\"_blank\">   WSJ article  </a> </u> , the pay gap between men and women continues to widen. It is reported that men&lsquo;s earnings have been growing twice as much as women&rsquo;s earnings for the past three quarters this year. To be fair, the gap has been getting narrower with women earning 81 cents for every dollar a man earns. Still, HR departments and organizations everywhere should cringe every time a new statistic regarding this pay gap gets reported. How do we continue to justify paying someone less for the same work because of their gender or in my case gender and race? In case you missed it, black women fair far worse when it comes to pay inequity in the workforce.</li><li> The average work day isn&rsquo;t what it used to be. Americans remain overworked and underpaid. According to a 2014 Gallup article called:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/175286/hour-workweek-actually-longer-seven-hours.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The &ldquo;40-Hour&rdquo; Workweek Is Actually Longer &mdash; by Seven Hours  </a> </u> , the 40-hour work week we all subscribe to is really a 47 hour week.  In fact, nearly 40% of full-time workers report working at least 50 hours per week.  The longer work day can be attributed to the average worker performing more than one role.</li><h3> <strong>  Show Me the Money or Not&hellip; </strong></h3>From 1979-2012 the top 1% saw a cumulative change in <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/files/charts/img/1536.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> real annual wages</a> of 153.6%. For the bottom 90% that change was only 17.1%. I guess more work, less money is the message.<li> Speaking of overworked, let&rsquo;s talk paid benefits and I&rsquo;m not talking about your medical and dental premiums. Did you know that the U.S. remains a part of a small percentage of nations that doesn&rsquo;t offer some semblance of paid maternity leave, paid annual leave, or paid time off each week? I&rsquo;ve always appreciated the notion of &ldquo;working hard and playing hard&rdquo;. However, I guess our message is work harder, play when we tell you and don&rsquo;t get pregnant or sick.</li><h3> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s Get To Work! </strong></h3>I share these numbers and facts to awaken HR practitioners everywhere. If it is true that we exist not only to support leadership, but to support our employees- why is this our reality in 2015? You either know someone that understands these realities all too well or you have been personally affected. Things in the world of work still suck, but it isn&rsquo;t beyond us to fix them. We have a duty to ensure our people thrive. It starts with working smarter, not necessarily harder. It means getting back to a place where we pay for performance, rather than likeability.I am certain that there are very few meetings in your organizations where you are examining the latest BLR statistics around wage or the latest report from the Economic Policy Institute on the &ldquo;State of Working America&rdquo;. Issues of retention, workforce planning, talent shortages and the like don&rsquo;t get dealt with when we are ignorant to the economic and societal realities that impact the progress of our employees and businesses. It&rsquo;s time to start examining these numbers and reports with your teams. The burden to change these things should not be completely shouldered by HR, but we should definitely be leading the charge.",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What percentage of the time do you devote to marketing and sales directed towards growing existing clients versus winning new prospects? </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re like many professionals, you get an adrenaline rush when you are in pursuit of an attractive new client prospect. You probably feel that new business naturally flows from existing relationships on the basis of doing good work, but that it&rsquo;s with new prospects that you really have to invest the effort and ramp up your game. Your existing clients, however, are almost always your best source of new business. And while quality of work is the foundation, you have to romance your long-standing clients with the same energy with which you pursue prospects if you want to sustain and grow them over time.</p><p> Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to realize the full potential of your existing client base? To help you, I&rsquo;m going to first describe how relationships can become stale. Then, I&rsquo;ll set out nine strategies you can use to revitalize existing relationships and put them back on a growth track.</p><h3>  When Good Relationships Go Bad</h3><p> <br/> Here are some of the things that can weaken or corrupt a seemingly healthy relationship:</p><p> <strong>  Low Energy. </strong>  You no longer have the same energy and enthusiasm for the client that you used to, and you stop going the extra mile. You do just what you have to but no more.</p><p> <strong>  Reactive. </strong>  You get used to the client giving you more business, and you stop being a proactive agenda setter who actively challenges the client and brings new ideas and perspectives to them.</p><p> <strong>  Slow. </strong>  You stop responding with the same alacrity you used to. One client of mine&mdash;before they became my client&ndash;had a major relationship with a large bank. On a Friday, some new federal regulations were approved which had significant implications for executive compensation and related personnel issues. On Monday the bank&rsquo;s SVP of Human Resources had a report on his desk assessing the impact of these new rules on the bank&rsquo;s programs. But it wasn&rsquo;t from my client&mdash;it was from a competitor who wanted to make inroads with this very attractive client! That afternoon my client&rsquo;s CEO got a call from the SVP. His opening salvo was this: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fire you.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Lack of personal interest. </strong>  You stop trying to improve the personal relationships at the client.</p><p> <strong>  Poor communications. </strong>  You communicate less and less, leading to a perception of reduced value. Remember, insufficient communication leads to missed cues and a lack of understanding of what your client is expecting</p><p> <strong>  Atavism. </strong>  This means &ldquo;going back to a past condition.&rdquo; This is an evolutionary term. During the sales process you take a big picture view with the prospective client. You deeply explore their agenda of key priorities. You discuss their aspirations. But then, during the actual delivery of the work you regress and become an &ldquo;expert for hire&rdquo; again. You only talk about operational execution and project milestones&mdash;no more big-picture discussions!</p><p> <strong>  No feedback. </strong>  You stop caring what your client thinks about the relationship, and you stop asking for their feedback.</p><p> <strong>  Poor actual or perceived quality of work. </strong> Sometimes, even the best companies suffer a lapse in the quality of their products and services. But equally, their can be a lapse in perceived quality. When communications are poor and expectations are not properly understood, your client can come to believe that a job that is actually objectively well done is not up to snuff.</p><p> Do any of these sound familiar?</p><p> <strong>  Nine Strategies to Revitalize a Client Relationship </strong></p><p> Here are some things you should be doing to keep your relationships fresh:</p><p> <strong>  1.  Treat all old clients like new clients.  </strong> You have to bring the same enthusiasm, new ideas, effort, and excitement to the 100th meeting with your clients that you demonstrated in the first meeting when you were wooing them.</p><p> <strong>  2. Ask, &ldquo;What would my competitors do to try and win this client&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;  </strong> This is not a rhetorical question because in fact your competitors are regularly trying to win a greater share of your client&rsquo;s business. Think through what their strategies might be, and examine which of those actions you should be taking yourself.</p><p> <strong>  3. Evolve your songs. </strong>  Here&rsquo;s an analogy: The Beatles build a global fan base and sold over 1.4 billion records by constantly evolving their music. They retained existing fans and continually added new ones.  Each successive record was a significant evolution in their music. They started with rocking numbers like &ldquo;She Was Just Seventeen&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Want to Hold Your Hand.&rdquo; Then they began evolving their music in many different ways. They changed the instrumental arrangements&mdash;think of Eleanor rigby which uses a double string quartet&ndash;four  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin\" target=\"_blank\">   violins  </a> </u> , two  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello\" target=\"_blank\">   cellos  </a> </u> , and two  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola\" target=\"_blank\">   violas  </a> </u> . Where are the guitars, the bass? They used instruments like the Indian Sitar&mdash;think about the introduction to Norwegian Wood. They evolved their themes&mdash;I Want to Hold Your Hand&rdquo; got the teenagers, the ballad &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo; captured our parents, and &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m 64&rdquo; pulled in the grandparents. They evolved just about every aspect of their music&mdash;BUT they kept the foundations of great melodies, terrific harmonies, and a driving beat. You don&rsquo;t want to sing &ldquo;I Want to Hold Your Hand&rdquo; year after year to your clients! You need to bring fresh points of view, insights, and ideas to your long-standing clients on a regular basis.</p><p> <strong>  4. Add talent to the team.  </strong> This is especially pertinent if you work with a firm. Continuity of relationship managers is essential, but it&rsquo;s also good to occasionally rotate some team members off of a client relationship and add new talent. This is good for your staff and also good for the client, because it can bring fresh thinking into the engagement.</p><p> <strong>  5. Add value in new ways. </strong> Is there a well-known academic or industry expert whose ideas would be relevant to your client? Can you use collaboration technologies to better connect with your client? Are there ancillary firms (individuals, boutiques) that you could use to offer something special to your client? Can you connect your client to other clients that you have, enabling them to directly share best practices? Can you bring someone in who can help your client better understand the impact of certain trends? Are there long-term fee arrangements that would more closely align your interests as long-term partners?</p><p> <strong>  6. Change the scenery and the way you interact. </strong>  Over time, you tend to get into habits and routines in the way you manage your relationships. Perhaps you always meet your client in the same office or conference room, and use the same format for presentations and memos. Change the scenery: organize an offsite instead of meeting all day in the client&rsquo;s conference room; take your client out to dinner with several of your other interesting business contacts; instead of PowerPoint slides, use multimedia, printed placemats, or oversized sheets of paper that you tape to the walls of the conference room.</p><p> <strong>  7. Do a relationship review with the client. This serves several objectives. </strong>  It&rsquo;s a chance to better understand their view of the relationship, to get a renewed sense of their emerging priorities and goals, and to add value by having a big-picture, agenda-setting conversation</p><p> <strong>  8.  Make an investment&mdash;do something unexpected.  </strong> Clients are always interested in developing their people, for example. What can you offer to help transfer skills and capabilities to your client&rsquo;s organization?  Is it a lunchtime seminar on a topic of current interest? A custom webpage or web portal you set up to help them access your most relevant content?</p><p> <strong>  9. Get an objective party to review the relationship with you. </strong> Familiarity doesn&rsquo;t have to breed neglect but it can certainly engender myopia. Ask an experienced colleague, who is not involved in the relationship, to sit in on a planning and review session. They won&rsquo;t be wedded to the same assumptions that you are basing your thinking on, and may offer a fresh perspective.</p><p> What have you found helpful in revitalizing your client relationships?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Body art can be a divisive subject, particularly when you&rsquo;re talking about the workplace. Many traditional companies, especially those with an older generations in the executive suite, still enforce anti-tattoo policies. Discrimination against tattoos are protected by law in the Constitution for criminal cases, but they are not protected federally in the workplace.</p><p> The bottom line? It&rsquo;s still legal for companies to not hire or fire someone for their tattoos, or to require all visible tattoos to be covered up during the workday.</p><h3> <strong>  Anti-Tattoo Mentalities </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even as recently in 2008, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/lib/thinking-of-inking-the-possible-impact-of-tattoos-on-your-job-search/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harris  </a> </u>  poll found these anti-tattoo mentalities in the U.S. Polling 2,000 adults, the survey found that 32% of people without tattoos believe that those with tattoos are likely to do something deviant. Those sentiments were echoed for businesses. It&rsquo;s likely these sentiments come from a traditional idea that tattoos represent the &ldquo;counterculture.&rdquo;</p><p> Companies see tattooed employees as a liability. If the customer doesn&rsquo;t trust your employees, you&rsquo;re sunk.</p><p> But that&rsquo;s back seven years ago. What about today? The tide seems to be shifting toward acceptance. In the past few years, major name companies have pulled back their anti-tattoo policies and openly allowed visible body art, including PetSmart, Bank of America, Olive Garden, and Wyndham Resorts.</p><h3> <strong>  Tattoos Are Becoming More Commonplace </strong></h3><p> <br/> As more and more people get inked, anti-body art sentiments are waning. After all, pervasiveness breeds acceptance. An organization to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.stapaw.com/#!tattoos-in-the-workplace-statistics/c1490\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Support Tattoos and Piercings at Work  </a> </u>  collected data on the state of tattoos on U.S. men and women.</p><li> Tattoo popularity has grown 13% since 2007 (when the first set of data was taken above)</li><li> The number of people with two or more tattoos has doubled since 2007</li><li> Women under 35 are almost 50% more likely to have tattoos than men under 35</li><li> Senior men are 71% more likely to have tattoos than senior women</li><li> The top five most popular locations for tattoos are, in order: lower back, wrist, foot, ankle, armband <br/>  </li><p> As more people start to have tattoos, it will be more and more difficult for companies to enforce an anti-body art policy. Moreover, recruiters and HR could struggle if the best person for the job has a visible wrist, foot, ankle, or armband tattoo &mdash; which are four of the five most popular locations.</p><h3> <strong>  Who Has Tattoos at Work and Can They Help? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Statistics seem to reinforce stereotypes when it comes to just what industries have the most tattooed employees. According to Support Tattoos and Piercings at Work, the top two job industries with the highest percentage of tattooed staff are:</p><li> The military</li><li> Agriculture <br/>  </li><p> But here&rsquo;s where things can get surprising: their research also found that the occupation with the most lenient tattoo policies is actually the government. However, government employees are some of the least likely to take advantage of these lenient policies, as only 8% of government employees have tattoos or body piercings.</p><p> Still, many job industries are furthering acceptance of tattoos, not just in blue-collar jobs, but particularly in the more creative fields as well. Research from  <u>  Tattooed Lifestyle </u>  shows that companies' polls found consumers to believe staff to be better at their jobs than non-tattooed employees in 48 fields, including:</p><li> Arts</li><li> Music</li><li> Journalism</li><li> Culinary</li><li> Television</li><li> Athletics</li><li> Design <br/>  </li><p> In these types of industries, tattoos are seen as a visual representation of creativity and art and can showcase to consumers these traits. And in these markets, that creativity and eye for style and design can be just what customers are looking for. It would be wise for companies to not only ditch anti-tattoo policies but openly encourage body art.</p><h3> <strong>  Do Tattoos Still Influence Hiring? </strong></h3><p> <br/> As the perceptions of body art change, is it actually changing hiring practices? Support Tattoos and Piercings at Work found these statistics, which seem to show a distance between perception and reality:</p><li> 76% of employees feel tattoos would hurt their job interview chances</li><li> But 73% of people say they would hire staff that had visible tattoos</li><li> And only 6% of tattooed people say they wouldn&rsquo;t hire someone with visible tattoos</li><li> 4% of tattooed or pierced people say they&rsquo;ve faced discrimination in their current job <br/>  </li><p> So there are two possibilities: Tattooed job candidates are still facing interview discrimination, even if hiring managers don&rsquo;t consciously realize it&rsquo;s happening. Or, the discrimination is waning, but tattooed people are still holding on to some of the past problems.</p><h3> <strong>  Discrimination Is Still Happening </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even if the tides are turning in favor of accepting employees with tattoos, a small amount are still feeling discriminated against, according to the above statistics. Recently, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29211526\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BBC  </a> </u>  asked tattooed workers to share their stories of the workplace.</p><p> From Emily in Washington:</p><p> &ldquo;I was promised a promotion when I turned 18. On my 18th birthday I got a half-sleeve [tattoo] and my boss immediately denied me the promotion he promised me. He didn't say directly that it was because of my tattoo, but the comments he made toward me made it clear he didn't like it,&rdquo; Emily added. &ldquo;He asked me if I was crazy for getting it and why my parents would let me do this to myself.&rdquo;</p><p> Sam from Australia shared a similar story but was also told to cover up tattoos even outside of working hours.</p><p> &ldquo;I had hours cut after getting my tattoos, even though they aren't visible. I have both feet done as well, but always wear socks and shoes. I work in childcare and was told that even out in public I had to keep appearances up, so to keep covered, because I might see the children I looked after outside hours.&rdquo;</p><p> Major companies are making strides toward tattoo acceptance, but traditional ideas of body ink are still adding to a negative perspective of tattoos in the workplace. However, this seems to be on the way toward change as more Americans see body art as commonplace and even as a positive for creative fields.</p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarryGlassman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Barry Glassman  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.glassmanwealth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Glassman Wealth  </u> </a></p><p> Every year, Schwab puts together and hosts Impact - the Super Bowl of conferences for financial advisors. For four days, they transform a city and its convention center into a star-studded hub of knowledge, resources, advice, access and entertainment.</p><p> So, now that you&rsquo;ve paid for your flight, hotel and registration fee (not an insignificant sum), how do you get the most impact out of your experience? I have a few suggestions:</p><p> <strong>  1. For the sessions, read the bios, not just the session titles: </strong></p><p> I believe that anyone can learn more from an interesting speaker, even if the topic may not be on your A-list, than a speaker with content you may find useful, but whose delivery makes it difficult to sit through their session, let alone remember the material. Tim Ferriss, the New York Times bestselling author of The 4-Hour Workweek, gave this great advice in his talk,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DNAY5Ulif0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   4 Tips to Rock SXSW  </a> </u> . Take the time to listen to his insightful advice before going to Impact.</p><p> <strong>  2. Ask the exhibitors the very best, MOST important question: </strong></p><p> You gotta love the exhibitors. Most people view them as salespeople. But you are going in armed with the most important, fantastic question. The one that taps their best knowledge while helping you gain an advantage over your competitors. Whether it is a product or a service provider, ask them: &ldquo;How are other advisors using your product or service?&rdquo; And don&rsquo;t accept a generic answer. Keep probing for innovative examples. You might just find something that could be a game changer for your firm.</p><p> <strong>  3. Talk to the techies: </strong></p><p> You can gain a lot by hanging out with people who are on the forefront of what&rsquo;s next. Technology can either provide you greater leverage and therefore time; or it can suck your time into a never-ending black hole. Sure, the people in charge of sales are there, but also the product development gurus. Find out how best practices can help (save) your practice and what&rsquo;s coming in the next updates.</p><p> <strong>  4. Get to know the Schwab folks. (Hint: They are the ones hanging out in the middle of the exhibit hall.) </strong></p><p> Consider this a super concentration of &ldquo;the best of&rdquo; Schwab all in one place. You will learn everything that Schwab offers advisors in this marketplace of talent and thought-leadership. Need help developing a strategic plan? They&rsquo;ve got that. Want better technology to serve your clients? Consider it done. Interested in new ways to attract clients? Look no further. Schwab has thought of literally everything you need to transform you business. All you have to do is show up and be curious.</p><p> <strong>  5. Pay it forward: </strong></p><p> Spend time with the financial planning students attending Impact. You will easily recognize them by their school colors and slightly harried program directors escorting them throughout the conference. Take the time to introduce yourself and answer their questions. It won&rsquo;t cost you a thing, but will mean the world to them.</p><p> <strong>  6. Create one deep connection with one person: </strong></p><p> Too often, we go to conferences with other people in our companies and never take the time to look outside our circle for a new friend. With over 3,000 advisors, vendors, fund managers and Schwab personnel in attendance, Impact is a target-rich environment to seek out and start a deep and lasting connection. That one person could make a huge difference in your life.</p><p> <strong>  7. Develop a winning strategy to get the best free stuff: </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re the person who needs to collect all of the logoed balls and stuffed animals, then grab a logoed bag first and arrive early to get the best SWAG.</p><p> <strong>  8. Attend &ldquo;Rethink Your Communications Strategy To Grow Your Business&rdquo;: </strong></p><p> While this may be a shameless plug to get you to attend my session on Wednesday, November 11 at 9:45 AM, I can tell you that you will not want to be anywhere else. Why? Let&rsquo;s just say that this is a &ldquo;tell all&rdquo; seminar. Among other things, you will find out why I list my competitors on our company&rsquo;s website, and why that has proven successful in generating new clients.</p><p> I&rsquo;d love to know if my suggestions were helpful. Please stop by, say hello and let me know when you see me at Impact!</p>",

Invest in yourself&mdash;it may well be where your next big idea is born.</p><p> <strong>  Write something that matters to you. </strong>  How many times have you found yourself muttering &ldquo;I need to write about that one day&rdquo;? But one day never comes and before you know it, someone else has written it. Get your idea out of your head and into the world. And don&rsquo;t just assume it must be a book&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s a completely different blog post, a provocative article, a new &ldquo;about&rdquo; page, an open letter to your future clients. Give yourself permission to work on what matters most.</p><p> <strong>  Wade deeper into social media. </strong>  You know you need to build a digital distribution channel for your business. So just pick one major platform where your clients and referral sources are legion and jump in. Set up your profile, learn the rules of the game and start participating. Be your best, most generous self and give where you can. Start building up your tribe, one new member at a time.</p><p> <strong>  Pitch a daring idea. </strong>  One that kinda makes you want to throw up&mdash;yep, THAT kind of daring. It should make you excited and nervous all rolled into one. Think: new idea, new market, new business, new client, new media. Or think equally scary on a smaller scale&mdash;like engaging your hero (who doesn&rsquo;t yet know you exist) in social media to spark a connection.</p><p> <strong>  Ditch what needs to die. </strong>  Sometimes, there is an item on your plate that needs to fall off for you to grow. A bad fit client, a service line that isn&rsquo;t pulling its weight, a creaky website that was you five iterations ago. Pulling the cord on what no longer serves you is powerful&mdash;not to mention excellent karma for 2016.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no need to make yourself insane over this. Just pick one thing and get busy.</p><p> And just so you know I&rsquo;m practicing what I preach, I&rsquo;m working on a book proposal that feels like a scary thrill ride. <strong>  What will YOU do with your 60 days? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in preserving the status quo; I want to overthrow it.&rdquo;  &mdash;Niccolo Machiavelli</p><p> No one ever succeeded by simply maintaining the status quo. The key to success is to constantly be growing, be changing, and be improving. In order to do these things, you must learn to not only question, but as Niccolo Machiavelli stated, overthrow the status quo. Here are four things you can do to get started.</p><h3> New questions</h3><p> <br/> One of the most obvious ways to overthrow the status quo is to start asking new questions. Ask questions about yourself, about your team, about your processes, about your goals, about the marketplace, and about your competition. Asking new questions helps keep you from falling into unproductive habits. Ask questions of others; encourage honest answers. Ask about plans and projects. Ask about the organization. Why do we do things this way? Does it work? Is there a better approach?</p><h3> New people</h3><p> <br/> You must understand that your own biases drive the way you view situations and the decisions that you make. To overthrow the status quo, try surrounding yourself with new people, the right people who can help you see through your biases. Build new relationships and get other people involved. Build yourself a team of subject matter experts and then learn to rely on their expert advice.</p><h3> New information</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t know everything. To overthrow the status quo, embrace curiosity and learning as part of your daily routine. Seek out new and valuable information, not just what you want to hear or information that substantiates what you already believe. Evaluate your failures and mistakes. What can you learn from them? What new information do they provide you with?</p><h3> New point-of-view</h3><p> <br/> The world we work in is changing at breakneck speeds. In order to remain competitive, you must learn to look at situations from a new point-of-view. You must learn how to have a perspective that is fluid and flexible. A fixed position will no longer serve anyone&rsquo;s best interest. Use a new vantage point to help overthrow the status quo.</p><h3> Overthrow the Status Quo</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t default to the status quo; it won&rsquo;t address the challenges to success that you will face. Use new questions, people, information, and points-of-view to reexamine situation, goals, processes, and ways of thinking. It&rsquo;s a new world, one in which the environment you are operating in is changing fast. If you want to keep up, overthrow the status quo.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A recent request to connect for an online meeting came my way with someone I met on social media. The startup in question was of keen interest. So I agreed to spend some time to learn more.</p><p> Only about three minutes into the presentation and I knew this possibility was not for me. I politely explained my thought and why I would need to turn down working together. And the following topics to share quickly came to mind.</p><p> <strong>  Partnering </strong></p><p> The excitement of a proposed job title, partnership, or collaborative effort, do not matter nearly as much as maintaining the integrity of your personal and business brands. The example above had to do with sharing contact information of others without permission.</p><p> Perhaps this is done more often today than 10 years ago, but I still believe it&rsquo;s best to be safe rather than sorry. Even more important for me, is to show the respect that I would expect of others. This would eliminate sharing or selling information for monetary gain without thought of the mess it might create for the people on the receiving end of thousands of unsolicited email.</p><p> <strong>  Reviews and Testimonials </strong></p><p> When people whom you barely know ask for testimonials or endorsements, suggest you speak in order to get to know one another better. Simply accommodating someone&rsquo;s request is less than honest. Again, you want to know the principles and priorities of another before you recommend that person.</p><p> <strong>  Referrals </strong></p><p> Upon being asked for a referral, make certain you understand the person&rsquo;s business well. And then qualify and match the best candidates to make a good referral.   The parties involved will be appreciative of your help.</p><p> <strong>  Online Likes  </strong></p><p> Read before you &ldquo;like&rdquo; a post. I sometimes wonder what people are thinking when they read a sad notice of a family member having passed away, but the person &ldquo;likes&rdquo; the comment. A personal note to the person who posted would be far more appropriate.</p><p> <strong>  Post Balance &ndash; Content versus Bragging Rights </strong></p><p> You will also notice some people who never post either helpful or interesting content. Instead, they continually brag about their number of followers or honors coming their way. It will be perfectly fine to post the recognition you receive when your posts are balanced with those designed to help your audience.</p><p> <strong>  Translate to Sales </strong></p><p> All of the above, once again, speaks to qualifying and matching those with whom you choose to work. Implied are the better business building strategies to protect your brand and build a reputable presence.</p><p> Adhering to these guidelines will lead you to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smooth Sale!  </a> </u></p>",

Be professional and timely in your responses and make sure your replies are meaningful.   </p><p> <strong>  Share Content: </strong>  Share links to articles or videos to educate, inform, and empower your connections.</p><p> <strong>  Invite Others to Connect: </strong>  Invite people you have met to connect with you. Personalize your invitation with a brief message mentioning how you met or reflect on a discussion you had. Avoid using the canned default message for invitations.</p><p> <strong>  Engage: </strong>  Scan posts made by your connections. If you see something you like, let them know. You don&rsquo;t need to make a comment every time; give a &ldquo;like&rdquo; to their update. Doing so will show you are interested in what others have to say.</p><p> <strong>  See Who Your Connections Are Connecting With: </strong>  This is a great opportunity to search for potential clients, centers of influence, or other people you want to connect with. Ask your connection to introduce you.</p><p> <strong>  Take Action: </strong>  LinkedIn provides a great feature that allows you to see when your connections are promoted, leave a company, or were mentioned in the news. Congratulate them on their success and take it a step further by sending a handwritten note. Human interaction still remains valuable.</p><p> This is a great checklist to keep your profile up to date and engaging. If you follow this daily checklist, you are sure to increase engagement with your audience and make more connections over time.</p>",

There are several reasons why you might want to use a credit card this holiday season. One that many people are already aware of is that using a credit card responsibly helps to establish a credit history. What some consumers may not know is that some purchases should always be made with a credit card in order for them to be able to take advantage of additional warranty protection, cash back rewards and other perks from various credit card providers.</p><p> <strong>  Technology, Appliances and Electronics </strong> <br/> These purchases are typically big-ticket items that you expect to last a long time. Buy with cash and you could lose out on an extended warranty and price protection. Use a credit card and enjoy double the warranty length provided by the manufacturer and a guarantee that will reimburse you if the price decreases after you make the purchase. High priced merchandise bought on some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.asapcreditcard.com/reward-cards.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   reward credit cards  </a> </u> , offer the added advantage of cash back.</p><p> <strong>  All Internet Purchases </strong> <br/> While cash isn&rsquo;t an option to use when buying online, money orders, checks and debit cards are, in addition to credit cards. Credit cards offer the same benefits as those listed above for big ticket items and an added perk of being able to track your purchases through your credit card&rsquo;s website. Some cards may offer protection, if the article you purchased online is lost or damaged in transit. Shopping at websites that include &lsquo;https&rsquo; in the web address or display a lock icon somewhere on the browser will provide a more secure payment system. Never send a credit card account number, password or other personal information via email or text message.</p><p> <strong>  Travel Reservations </strong> <br/> One of the reasons travel reward cards are the one of the most popular credit cards is due to the focused perks and customer assistance for travelers. Purchase airfare with a card and have the security of knowing your protected if luggage gets lost or you have need of emergency medical care or roadside assistance. Lose your passport and call the number on the back of the credit card for help.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.asapcreditcard.com/airline-mile.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   EscapeSM by Discover&reg; Card  </a> </u>  even offers trip cancellation or interrupted service of up to $2,500.  While you don&rsquo;t have to use a designated travel credit card, you will enjoy more travel related benefits, bigger rewards and more opportunities to earn them.</p><p> <strong>  Rental Cars </strong> <br/> Major credit cards offer rental coverage against collision and theft, if you pay for the entire rental agreement with the card and decline the rental company&rsquo;s insurance coverage. The coverage is supplemental in nature. Claims will first be sent to the cardholder&rsquo;s personal auto insurer. The credit card rental coverage will take care of the deductible and other expenses that aren&rsquo;t covered by your personal insurance carrier.</p><p> <strong>  Overseas Shopping </strong> <br/> Two big reasons to use credit cards when traveling overseas are generally wide acceptance and a safer form to carry than other payment types. Your purchases will have the same protections as other general purchases, large or small. Some issuers will provide a more favorable exchange rate than a currency exchange office, saving the cardholder money. Unlike cash that is gone in a moment when lost or stolen, a lost or stolen credit card can easily be cancelled, protecting your account&rsquo;s integrity and your money.</p><p> <strong>  The Bottom Line </strong> <br/> Benefits vary with each credit card offer. Yours may offer cell phone insurance for paying with a card or discount tickets for major sports or entertainment venues; read the fine print. And remember that using a credit card is a convenient privilege and should never be a necessity. If you are accumulating a balance, it&rsquo;s time to put the card away and use cash until you pay off the outstanding debt.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rogerdooley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Roger Dooley  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Neuromarketing  </u> </a>  </p><p> Shakespeare told us that &ldquo;eyes are the window to our soul,&rdquo; and, as with many things, the Bard had keen insight. A variety of studies have shown us that specific eye characteristics affect how much we trust or like someone. This isn&rsquo;t just true in person, but <strong>   even when we view the person via print or digital media. </strong></p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/30/0956797615588306.abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   most recent study  </a> </u>  had subjects play a &ldquo;trust game&rdquo; with a virtual partner. The pupils of the face on the screen were digitally modified to dilate (get bigger), stay the same, or constrict.</p><p> Trust was significantly greater for the virtual partners with dilating pupils and lower for those with constricting pupils. The scientists also observed mimicry, i.e., the subjects&rsquo; pupils responded to their partner by mimicking the pupil condition they were seeing.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Very%20small%20changes%20to%20eyes%20in%20photos%20increase%20%23trust%20and%20attractiveness%20%20pic.twitter.com%2F3S0deJMSEv&amp;via=rogerdooley&amp;related=rogerdooley&amp;url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/?p=12042\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Very small changes to eyes in photos increase #trust and attractiveness  </a> </u></p><p> There&rsquo;s other research showing the importance of dilated pupils. Decades ago,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092656678900624\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   White and Maltzman demonstrated  </a> </u>  that when we are  <strong>  interested </strong>  in something, our pupils get bigger. </p><p> An  <u>  earlier study </u>  suggested that dilated pupils indicated  <strong>  sexual arousal </strong> , although it&rsquo;s possible that the dilation was triggered more by interest in the subject matter than actual arousal.</p><p> Sample images from Dartmouth fMRI study</p><p> More recently,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bil/pubs/demos_cc_2005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dartmouth researchers used fMRI  </a> </u>  to determine that our brain&rsquo;s  <strong>  amygdala </strong>  responds to larger pupils. The amygdala is a brain structure associated with emotions, fear, and pleasure.</p><p> The Dartmouth scientists also found, unsurprisingly, that the subjects were not aware of their response or even that there were variations in pupil size in the images they saw.</p><h3> Don Draper&rsquo;s Neuromarketing?</h3><p> <br/> We think of neuromarketing as a recent development, but advertisers have been trying to gauge the subconscious reactions of consumers for many years. The  Mad Men  series may have just missed Don Draper, or at least his agency research people, turning to biometric measurements. In the 1970s,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=9552\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pupillometry was used  </a> </u>  as a means of evaluating how consumers reacted to ads.</p><p> These early neuromarketers ran into a problem similar to that facing their counterparts of today. While emotional responses can be detected and even quantified, it&rsquo;s more difficult to determine exactly what emotion the subject is experiencing. Is she aroused or disgusted? Amused or angered?</p><p> Add to that the challenge of predicting buying behavior from the uncertain emotion and you can see why pupillometry was mostly abandoned.</p><p> Even today, though, pupil dilation is cited as one of many biometric measures available to neuromarketers. It&rsquo;s relatively easy to measure, and its predictive power may be enhanced by combining it with other streams of biometric or brain activity data.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Your%20Eyes%20Are%20The%20Door%20to%20Trust.%20Attractiveness%2C%20Too.%20%23Neuromarketing%20pic.twitter.com%2FNV03KD6KlZ&amp;via=rogerdooley&amp;related=rogerdooley&amp;url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/?p=12042\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Your Eyes Are The Door to Trust. Attractiveness, Too. #Neuromarketing  </a> </u></p><h3> In-person pupil control?</h3><p> <br/> How can you apply this knowledge?</p><p> For in-person contact, your options for sending trust signals via pupil dilation are limited. Even though you might like to enlarge your pupils as you interact with others, pupil size variations are an involuntary response. </p><p> I have heard suggestions that one could concentrate intently on something, an activity known to dilate pupils. But, if you are trying to solve complex math problems simultaneously with having a conversation, the results will almost certainly be bad.</p><p> You probably don&rsquo;t want to use those horrible drops your eye doctor uses to chemically dilate your pupils. The people you meet might wonder why you seem to be unfocused and visually challenged.</p><p> You could always try  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.visiondirect.com/baby-eyes-contact-lens/qxp306790\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contacts that simulate dilated pupils  </a> </u>  or even  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spookyeyes.com/crazy-contact-lenses/funky-eyes-black-contact-lenses\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   max them out  </a> </u> . Then again, you might end up looking like you stepped out of an anime cartoon.</p><p> Probably the best bet is to  <strong>  maintain eye contact </strong>  with the person you are talking to and hope your pupils automatically mimic what they see. Mutual dilation will likely lead to  <strong>  greater trust </strong> .</p><h3> Do photo shoots decrease trustworthiness?</h3><p> <br/> In a typical photo or video shoot, what do you have? Usually, lots of light. Bright lights. And, even if you can avoid squinting, those bright lights will cause you (or your model&rsquo;s) pupils to get smaller.</p><p> One solution is to keep the ambient studio lighting fairly dark so that the pupils stay reasonably dilated. For still photos, the flash duration will be short enough to capture the image before the pupils shrink in response.</p><p> Of course, you may be working with existing images or stock photos. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s fairly easy for a photo retoucher to change pupil size after the fact. Most of the scientific experiments looking into pupil size use exactly that technique.</p><p> If the subject of a photo is representing you or your brand, it would be worth a moment to check for tiny pupils. A re-shoot or even a subtle retouching effort might pay off in  <strong>  higher likability and trust levels </strong> .</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Forget Your Limbal Ring&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The seductive pull of large pupils has been commonly known for years. </p><p> But, it turns out there&rsquo;s another eye characteristic that makes one attractive &ndash; a more prominent  <strong>  limbal ring </strong> . The limbal ring is the perimeter of the iris and forms the boundary with the &ldquo;white&rdquo; of the eye.</p><p> A  <u>  study at UC Irvine </u>  found that subjects of both sexes found an opposite-gender image more attractive when the eyes had thicker limbal rings.</p><br /><p> In the illustration above (used in the UC study), male viewers preferred the face image on the right.</p><p> Since the limbal ring tends to get less prominent as we age, the researchers concluded that a thicker ring was a marker for youth and health.</p><p> There&rsquo;s not a lot you can do about your own limbal ring. Some  <u>  cosmetic contact lenses </u>  do simulate a thicker, darker ring. For most of us, though, that might seem like a rather extreme solution.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=2%20changes%20to%20your%20online%20photo%20increase%20your%20%23trust%20and%20attractiveness%20pic.twitter.com%2FNV03KD6KlZ%20&amp;via=rogerdooley&amp;related=rogerdooley&amp;url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/?p=12042\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2 changes to your online photo increase your #trust and attractiveness  </a> </u></p><p> Once again, retouching may be the answer. As with your beady, pin-point pupils, your Photoshop pro can take care of an inadequate limbal ring with little difficulty. While she&rsquo;s removing skin imperfections and giving you a Hollywood-quality smile, have her darken your limbal ring. That might do as much for for your apparent youth and vigor as the other tweaks!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;ve realized -- or received feedback -- that you need to develop your \"executive presence,\" you&rsquo;re certainly not alone. For most people promoted to senior positions, it&rsquo;s not standard equipment.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve coached many leaders to upgrade their executive presence. My clients know that to operate effectively at the senior level, you need to tailor how you show up with others to be at your most influential and credible, enabling you to be a member of (rather than a visitor among) your senior colleagues. Having an influential voice among those at the big table is what's often referred to as \"gravitas.\"</p><p> <strong>  grav&middot;i&middot;tas (grāv'ĭ-t&auml;s') n. (source: dictionary.com) </strong></p><p> Substance; weightiness: a frivolous biography that lacks the gravitas of its subject.</p><p> A serious or dignified demeanor: \"Our national father figure needs gravitas, [but] he's pitched himself as the kid brother\" (John Leo).</p><p> In the context of leadership, here are six practices to upgrade your own gravitas:</p><h3> 1. Be poised and assured in the value of your own contribution</h3><p> <br/> Gravitas requires remaining calm, even under fire, and finding within yourself the assurance that your value at the table is constant and worthwhile, without having to prove it (e..g, trying to be the smartest person in the room, dominating air time, or needing to be right.) It&rsquo;s natural, particularly when awed or even intimidated by the intellects or accomplishments of others around you, to devalue or marginalize yourself in subtle but noticeable ways. Don&rsquo;t give in to such fear, but simply notice it in the moment, and dismiss it without reacting to it. Your value to the discussion remains constant no matter who else is in the room.</p><h3> 2. Use great judgment about using assertions, questions, and silence</h3><p> <br/> Being judicious about what and when to assert, when to inquire, and when to use attentive silence is key to gravitas. When asserting your ideas keep it short, simple, clear, and contextualized by the current discussion. Don&rsquo;t restate other&rsquo;s ideas. When in doubt, less is more. When you are silent, be present by active listening and staying off your devices. Listen like it matters. When asking questions, keep them on topic or message, short, and oriented toward &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; and certainly not &ldquo;why,&rdquo; and toward the future or present, rather than the past.</p><h3> 3. Avoid unhelpful verbal habits</h3><p> <br/> Minimize verbal mannerisms such as &ldquo;um&rdquo; and &ldquo;you know?&rdquo; and &ldquo;you know what I mean?&rdquo; and &ldquo;like,&rdquo; and any other filler words or phrases (e.g., &ldquo;&hellip;at the end of the day,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to be honest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; etc.) that may sound like nervous habits or ticks. Watch the tendency to &ldquo;up talk&rdquo;&mdash;that is, don&rsquo;t end declarative sentences or phrases with an upward inflection, like a question. I often use video practice to show a client these habits, which tend to hide in their blind spot.</p><h3> 4. Be confident without being arrogant</h3><p> <br/> Arrogance and gravitas simply don&rsquo;t coexist. When you&rsquo;re perceived as arrogant, you&rsquo;re trying too hard. Others read it as overbearing and insecure. People who deserve their seat at the table don&rsquo;t have to buy it at every meeting. You have nothing to prove. You certainly don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;win&rdquo; with any particular idea, point, or deep thought. You don&rsquo;t want to throw your colleagues under the bus, even when you think they deserve it. Treat those you don&rsquo;t respect with respect. Remember, others with gravitas are doing that already.</p><h3> 5. Watch your body language</h3><p> <br/> 80 percent or more of your communication is non-verbal -- while that's a common statistic, it's often underplayed or disregarded.  How you show up physically -- arms crossed or not, sitting back or forward, how stressed you seem, how fast you walk in and out of the room -- these all shape or limit your impact among your senior colleagues.  Noticing your own body language is critical to establishing a strong executive presence.</p><h3> 6. Observe yourself and the situation as you participate</h3><p> <br/> For all of the above to work, you need to monitor yourself and others as you participate. What&rsquo;s my role here? What&rsquo;s unspoken here? Where should we head with this, and how is my participation helping, neutral or hindering that direction? What&rsquo;s needed here? These are all self-monitoring questions that can help you adjust your impact for the better in real time.</p><p> When done right, gravitas is not a mask&mdash;it&rsquo;s effectively adding your unique value to important discussions while minding and maintaining important relationships.</p><p> When gravitas is lacking, people know it, and when it&rsquo;s present, they take notice: &ldquo;She can really hold a room.&rdquo; &ldquo;His ideas are always welcomed by the board, even when there&rsquo;s debate or disagreement.&rdquo; &ldquo;When she speaks, people sit up and take notice.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Get your gravitas on, and your leadership is upgraded. </strong> Your contributions at the senior most levels will have the impact and be given the consideration they are due.</p>",

We can, however, apply our common wisdom, realizing that as Mark Twain said, &ldquo;history doesn&rsquo;t repeat itself but it does rhyme.&rdquo;</p><p> The estate tax is known to have existed in 700 B.C. in Egypt and as well as in ancient Rome. In this country, various forms of the estate tax were imposed throughout the 1700s and 1800s. It was again enacted in 1916 during the &ldquo;Progressive Era,&rdquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.pennmutual.com/is-the-estate-tax-dead/#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   [2]  </a> </u>  which arose in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/ArtWeb/310E8B3293A7AD62852571A20068CBB7?OpenDocument\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   populist response to years of great wealth  </a> </u>  being accumulated in the hands of a few, the fear of a corresponding abuse of power, along with long inaction by Congress. Does this situation sound familiar?</p><p> <strong>  The most recent changes to the estate tax were made permanent with the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) </strong> . Most people who work in tax policy area consider the term &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; as another way of saying &ldquo;one election cycle away.&rdquo; The estate tax has been changed approximately 40 times in the 100 years since its enactment, and it is a safe bet that it will be changed again, even if that may be in a decade or two.</p><p> One thing that concerns me is that I see people making decisions about their estate plans as if the estate tax will never again be an issue. In particular, they may have a permanent life insurance policy they bought to help pay estate taxes, and now they are letting these policies lapse &ldquo;because there isn&rsquo;t any estate tax anymore.&rdquo;</p><p> It is true that there&rsquo;s no estate tax today, except for the very wealthy, but there might very well be one in the future. It might come back as a concern when you&rsquo;re uninsurable, so, to me, it makes sense to keep an existing life insurance policy in force as a hedge against future changes. Permanent life insurance is never a bad thing. It provides your family with protection, and, through its accumulated cash value, it offers other possibilities that you can take advantage of over the course of your life.</p><p> Here in Advanced Sales, we spend a good deal of our time helping agents and their clients repurpose their life insurance as their lives change. For example, a policy purchased for survivor needs might next be used for supplemental college funding, and then supplemental retirement. A key person policy might also support a buyout arrangement or a deferred compensation plan.</p><p> One of the life insurance mistakes we often encounter is that insureds lapse or surrender their policies during the best of times, when life seems to be under control and predictable. And then, life happens, and they find they need insurance again, but sometimes they are now uninsurable.</p><p> I would apply the same lesson to the estate tax. We are currently in the best of times on the estate tax, but public policy happens and things change. The timeframe for the change may be a decade or two, but life insurance and estate planning are also things that are intended to work over a timeframe of a decade, or more. Nobody knows the exact timing of a change to the estate tax, but the chances are good that it&rsquo;s likely to happen, so people should still be taking steps now to position themselves. It&rsquo;s just part of a diversified strategy.</p><p> Certainly, if someone has an existing permanent life insurance policy purchased as part of an estate plan to help pay estate taxes, do not surrender it. Instead, use it now as part of legacy planning. Clients may choose to spend down their other assets knowing that the life insurance can be part of the legacy they leave their beneficiaries. Or they may decide to name or add a charitable beneficiary. Or they may use the accumulated cash value for life&rsquo;s possibilities. Then, if the estate tax comes back, they will have insurance in place to help pay taxes once again.</p><p> Life insurance policies contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force.  Accessing cash values may result in surrender fees and charges, may require additional premium payments to maintain coverage, and will reduce the death benefit and policy values.  Partial withdrawals during the first 15 policy years are subject to additional rules and may be taxable. Excess policy loans can result in termination of a policy.  A policy that lapses or is surrendered can potentially result in tax consequences. Always consult a qualified tax advisor regarding your personal tax situation and a qualified legal professional for your personal estate planning situation.</p><u> <a href=\"http://blog.pennmutual.com/is-the-estate-tax-dead/#_ftnref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a></u> According to Darien B.

    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> Did you know that only  <u>  <a href=\"http://kapost.com/content-marketing-facts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   44 percent of B2B marketers  </a> </u>  who publish original content have a documented strategy in place?</p><p> Despite the fact that  <u>  <a href=\"http://kapost.com/content-marketing-facts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   78 percent of today&rsquo;s CMOs  </a> </u>  think that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/content-marketing-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   custom content  </a> </u>  and other forms of inbound marketing are the future, too few organizations are taking the time to properly document their plans for the future. Creating specific, measurable goals and a well-thought-out content marketing plan can allow your brand to benchmark your Internet marketing program, and maximize return on investment. Here are a few tactics best-of-class marketers are using in their corporate inbound marketing strategy.</p><h3> 1. Timelines</h3><p> <br/> Determining that you want to triple your conversion rates may be achievable, but you need more specific steps on how to get there. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ilyapozin/2013/10/03/12-things-all-successful-people-do/\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes&rsquo; Ilya Pozin  </a> </u> , the world&rsquo;s most effective people set daily goals. Your inbound marketing strategy must include daily, weekly and monthly targets to achieve your annual benchmarks.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  If the idea of setting some goals specifically for your online marketing interests you, check out our  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   S.M.A.R.T. goal planning template  </a> </u> , where you can document your goals and share them with others to help with accountability in your organization.</p><h3> 2. Metrics</h3><p> <br/> How can you possibly measure things you haven&rsquo;t defined? More importantly, you can&rsquo;t possibly improve what you can&rsquo;t measure. It&rsquo;s easy to be overwhelmed by the avalanche of marketing metrics you&rsquo;ll find in Omniture, Google Analytics or other packages. Your brand doesn&rsquo;t need to measure everything, but it does need to select approximately 6-10 key performance indicators, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/conversion-rate-not-just-for-ecommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   conversion rate  </a> </u> , for your digital marketing efforts.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  Corporate marketers look for benchmarks to understand if their KPIs are up to snuff. Don&rsquo;t accept the status quo or the benchmarks you find online. These are going to be different in every industry. Baseline your KPIs with your own data, then track trends on a monthly basis to see how they change. There&rsquo;s always room for improvement!</p><h3> 3. Campaigns</h3><p> <br/> What are your brand&rsquo;s overarching goals for the next three, six or 12 months? Are you hoping to sign more consultation clients? Bring your latest product to market? Sign up more free trial users? These large-scale goals translate into strategy, which should include campaigns or &ldquo;focal points&rdquo; to focus on in your custom content, social media and lead generation efforts. By taking a campaign-level focus on your priorities, you&rsquo;ll achieve more unified and effective brand messaging.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  We always build campaigns around goals. Specific goals not only help you determine how aggressive your corporate internet marketing efforts need to be, but they also make creating your online marketing plan by answering the &ldquo;what&rdquo; &mdash; what content you&rsquo;ll publish and promote.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/not-seeing-results-from-inbound-marketing-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Read this article  </a> </u>  to see our inbound marketing campaign framework that aligns all of your tactics to get results.</p><h3> 4. Custom Content</h3><p> <br/> Marketers with a documented content strategy are nearly twice as likely to successfully measure ROI, according to the  <u>  Content Marketing Institute </u> . Business blogs, e-books, white papers and social media content are the fuel for your brand&rsquo;s efforts to increase awareness and win more customers. Including content marketing planning in your inbound corporate marketing strategy can ensure you&rsquo;re able to move forward.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip: </strong>  It may defy conventional wisdom that your prospective customers will use your website to download information. It may not be a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; in your industry, but that&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/b2b-web-forms-to-download-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the reason  </a> </u>  you should try it.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/work/client-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   It works  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 5. Marketing Automation</h3><p> <br/> Is your corporate website a lean, lead generation machine? If you&rsquo;re not investing in marketing automation, you may be working too hard and still missing opportunities. Your customers are likely to opt for self-directed product research, and engage with sales after performing research. By automating your lead nurturing, you can educate your prospects in a non-pushy, effective way.</p><p> <strong>  Pro tip:  </strong> Marketing automation isn&rsquo;t just useful while you&rsquo;re trying to convert a prospect to a customer. It can also be used with customers to help get customer reviews, distribute helpful information, and alert your sales team when a prospect takes an action on your website.</p><p> Is your strategy as defined as it could be? Are your tactics aligned to meet your goals?</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

    "title": "The Top 50 Behavioral Habits Every Young Entrepreneur Must Adopt",
    "link": "the-top-50-behavioral-habits-every-young-entrepreneur-must-adopt",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  1. Prepare and plan. </strong>  Plan tomorrow&rsquo;s agenda today. Create a daily schedule. Routine is very important for every entrepreneur. Without it, it&rsquo;s just too easy to get off track. Set a few clear goals and the next day work on them with relentless focus until they are complete. Create a weekly schedule. This schedule lets the rest of your team know when you are available for in-office meetings, out-of-office meetings and when you are simply not available, for instance when you are working out at the gym. </p><p> <strong>  2. Begin your day the night before. </strong>  Every night before bed, I think about this question: If I live every day the same way I did today, what kind of future would I be creating? It forces me to constantly evaluate whether or not my actions are lining up with my priorities. The future is shaped one day at a time, and it's never as far away as we think.</p><p> <strong>  3. Regular sleep schedule. </strong>  Our bodies are systems of habit. We like to get what we expect. This goes for our physical body as much as for our mind. A regular sleep schedule with sufficient hours of sleep (six to eight is ideal) will do wonders for your productivity. If you want to reduce stress and feel better overall, get some sleep and get sleep regularly at regular hours throughout the week. Make sure you go to bed at the same time every night.</p><p> <strong>  4. Go to bed early. </strong>  One hour before midnight is worth 2 hours after midnight. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that all eight-hour periods just aren&rsquo;t created equally. Going to bed at 10 pm and waking up around 6 am is WAY better than going to bed at 3 am and waking up around 11 am, even though the number of hours of sleep is the same. I&rsquo;ve tested this over and over again: I don&rsquo;t perform well if I stay up past 10PM.</p><p> <strong>  5. Sweet dreams. </strong>  Too many people I know need to medicate themselves in order to enjoy a good night&rsquo;s rest. Those drugs can easily be replaced with a few sleep habits. Try taking a walk in the evenings. Turn off the TV an hour before bedtime and read something positive. Studies show that exercising in the mornings can help promote better sleep at night.</p><p> <strong>  6. Early to rise. </strong>  Most people sleep 30 minutes too long every morning. Take time for yourself in the morning and be much better prepared for the day ahead. Early risers really do have a distinct advantage when it comes to mental clarity, acuity and energy. In simple words: waking up early works better than any other strategy for becoming more productive. But you have to make sure you get enough sleep to back it up. So get to bed!</p><p> <strong>  7. Breathe.  </strong> Take 10 slow breaths, think about your main objectives for the day, then get moving. This seems too simple to have an effect, but it&rsquo;s not. If you&rsquo;re used to getting up already in battle mode, then you&rsquo;ve probably forgotten how it feels to have a moment to yourself. Deep breathing is also another anxiety reducer. Deep breathing is a key to meditation and other relaxation techniques.</p><p> <strong>  8. Hydrate. </strong>  Drink water, lots and lots of water &ndash; preferably at least half a liter at the moment of waking up and then another two liters throughout the day. Most Americans are chronically dehydrated.</p><p> <strong>  9. Meditate.  </strong> It isn&rsquo;t just for yogis. You don&rsquo;t need to sit cross-legged on the floor, but allowing your mind to clear itself is necessary if you want to push yourself to your limits. Your mind is the most important tool you have. Treat it right and it will treat you well in return. You need to control your mind and thoughts as much as possible or risk getting lost in your stress and unnecessary worries.</p><p> <strong>  10. Pray. </strong>  When you meditate, God speaks to you. When you pray you speak to God. If you don&rsquo;t know what to say, start by saying \"thanks!&rdquo; If \"thanks\" is the only prayer you ever utter, it would be sufficient.</p><p> <strong>  11. Read something educational. </strong>  Make it a habit to learn a new skill every day. Never stop learning. Learn a new language. Learn a new computer program. Learn a new sport. Just don&rsquo;t stop learning.</p><p> <strong>  12. Read something inspirational every day to grow spiritually. </strong> Reading biographies can be very inspirational and encourage you to achieve greater things in life.</p><p> <strong>  13. Keep a journal.  </strong> Write something every day that you are grateful for. Make gratitude a habit. Record your experiences, your feelings and your thoughts.</p><p> <strong>  14. Listen to   <u>   <a href=\"http://knowgogrow.com/25-free-podcast-sites-for-entrepreneurs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    podcasts   </a>  </u>  . </strong>  There some really great podcasts that can educate, motivate and inspire you while you exercise, run or even drive to work.</p><p> <strong>  15. Revisit your goals, objectives and priorities.  </strong> Regular review of your goals helps you stay focused and on track. If you&rsquo;re not having fun you&rsquo;re not doing it right. If you don&rsquo;t love what you are doing you&rsquo;ll never be a success at it.</p><p> <strong>  16. Don&rsquo;t just be grateful, be thankful. </strong>  Express your thanksgiving in words. Silent gratitude doesn't do much for others, it only benefits ourselves. People like to be appreciated, and a bit of  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/20-life-lessons-ive-learned-from-my-mother/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   kindness  </u>    </a> can go a long way. I&rsquo;m sure God feels the same way.</p><p> <strong>  17. Spend 7 minutes stretching and cardio before jumping in the shower. </strong> Not all productive people are health freaks, but they do all understand that for the mind to work at its maximum potential, the body requires physical exercise. You don&rsquo;t need to spend hours at the gym, but if you can get 30 minutes every day of either cardio or calisthenics, you will love yourself for it and you will gain massive improvement in productivity. Ride a bike to work for a nice change of transportation and added exercise.</p><p> <strong>  18. Sing in the shower. </strong>  I sing in the shower every morning. Singing has positive psychological effects on us. The act of singing releases endorphins, the brain's \"feel good\" chemicals. Singing can have some of the same effects as exercise, like the release of endorphins, which give the singer an overall \"lifted\" feeling and are associated with stress reduction. It's also an aerobic activity, meaning it gets more oxygen into the blood for better circulation, which tends to promote a good mood.</p><p> <strong>  19. Take a hot-cold shower every morning. </strong>  By doing 30 seconds of ice cold water, followed by 30 seconds of hot, then 30 seconds of cold water (always ending with cold water), I gain the energy and clarity to start my day feeling refreshed. To get started in this habit do a normal shower. Then turn the water as cold as it goes for 30 seconds. Then crank it as hot as you can stand it for 30 seconds. Then end your shower with cold water for 30 seconds. Vigorously towel yourself dry to get your blood flowing and you'll feel great!</p><p> <strong>  20. Eat a hearty breakfast. </strong>  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Breakfast provides you with the energy and nutrients that help you concentrate throughout the day. Studies show that breakfast can be important in maintaining a healthy body weight. Hunger can set in long before it's time for lunch, and many people who have not eaten breakfast snack on foods that are high in fat and sugar. People who skip breakfast are unlikely to make up their daily requirement for some vitamins and minerals that a simple breakfast would have provided.</p><p> <strong>  21. Ask yourself one simple, yet very powerful question </strong>  \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?&rdquo; If the answer is \"Yes!&rdquo; then go ahead with your plans. Focus on making a difference. If your focus is only on making money you&rsquo;ll live a very empty life. Make an impact wherever you go so that people arriving there in the future will know that you were there ahead of them.</p><p> <strong>  22. Start before you are ready. </strong>  Determine to live with purpose. When you know what your purpose is, begin to move in that direction. You will acquire the skills and resoucres as you go. I call it the know-go-grow process.</p><p> <strong>  23. Think big but start small. </strong>  Begin now. Instead of putting off writing that book, start by writing out the chapter titles. The write one chapter at a time. Or even, one page a time. Set a big goal, break it down into small steps and begin today. That&rsquo;s the key to getting things done.</p><p> <strong>  24. Hug at least five people every day. </strong>  Science has proven that even engineers need a hug from time to time even though they would never admit it. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/how-hugs-help-and-how-hugs-heal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   benefits of hugging  </a> </u>  are many and the cost is zero. Never end your day without hugging at least one person.</p><p> <strong>  25. Validate someone every day. </strong>  You have a great smile. I like your suit. Great haircut! Everyone needs validation. You are the best! You&rsquo;ve just been validated. Now go validate someone else.</p><p> <strong>  26. Approach everything with confidence. </strong>  You are better than you realize. You have more potential than you can imagine. Now look in the mirror every morning and tell yourself that you matter and that do are making a difference. Make it a habit to walk straight and stand tall. Imagining a hook in the top of my head works for me.</p><p> <strong>  27. Learn to delegate. </strong>  However, be aware that people don&rsquo;t do what you expect, they do what they know you&rsquo;ll inspect. Effective delegation isn&rsquo;t just giving orders, it&rsquo;s following up and inspecting what&rsquo;s been done.</p><p> <strong>  28. Spend less than your earn. </strong> Make it a habit to keep a current spending plan or budget. Sounds simple. Easier said than done. Everything is.</p><p> <strong>  29. Seek to simply one thing in your life every day. </strong>  A minimalist attitude can eliminate a lot of stress and increase your happiness. We don&rsquo;t need &bdquo;stuff&rdquo; to make us happy.</p><p> <strong>  30. Speak only positive words. </strong>  Eliminate the words \"bad luck\" from your vocabulary. Don&rsquo;t accept the words \"it can&rsquo;t be done\" from anyone. If you can&rsquo;t say something nice about someone, it's better to keep your mouth shut.</p><p> <strong>  31. Make it a habit to focus on one task at a time. </strong>  Stop multi-tasking. Learn to close your door. Turn off your phone. Unplug from social media.</p><p> <strong>  32. Stay on top of your email.  </strong> Whether it&rsquo;s once every hour, or once every day, have regular times to clean out your inbox and stick to them. Turn off your notifications.</p><p> <strong>  33. Make your workout times a priority  </strong> and put them into your calendar for the next year. This is scheduling your priority, rather trying to prioritize what&rsquo;s already on your schedule. If you don&rsquo;t feel good nothing else matters.</p><p> <strong>  34. Put a high value on time. </strong>  Be fanatical about gaurding your time. Use tools like Asana to manage your team communications and projects. Make lists once. Stop re-writing incomplete tasks over to the next day. Use Asana to schedule create your to-do lists. It will bug you until you complete the task. Or, you can easily assign it to another team member.</p><p> <strong>  35. Learn to say no. </strong>  Running a  <u>  <a href=\"http://knowgogrow.com/50-small-business-ideas-for-young-people-in-developing-countries\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business  </a> </u>  is a big undertaking. Successful entrepreneurs understand what&rsquo;s important to themselves and to their business. They know how to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the things that are not going to take them closer to their goals. This doesn&rsquo;t mean successful entrepreneurs don&rsquo;t help people, it means that they understand their limitations and what they realistically should and shouldn't give their time to.</p><p> <strong>  36. Show up on time. </strong>  Be punctual. Successful entrepreneurs understand that everyone&rsquo;s time is precious. They show up on time for meetings and expect everyone else to do the same. Punctuality is a sign of dedication, commitment and follow-through.</p><p> <strong>  37. Take notes. </strong>  It&rsquo;s not unusual for people to request a copy of my notes following a meeting. Taking notes while someone else is speaking let&rsquo;s them know you are taking an interest in what they have to say.</p><p> <strong>  38. Remember to smile. </strong>  Practise smiling as soon as you wake up in the morning. Then practise it throughout the day for others. Greet everyone you meet with a smile.</p><p> <strong>  39. Think only positive thoughts. </strong>  Refuse to dwell on negative thoughts. We become what we think about the most. Make it a habit to focus on what you want, not what you don&rsquo;t.</p><p> <strong>  40. Surround yourself with people on the same mission as you are. </strong>  Make it a habit to hire slow and fire fast to make sure that you only have like-minded people on your team.</p><p> <strong>  41. Have lunch at the same time every day.  </strong> Regular times for meals helps your digestive system to stay regular. Eat more meals and smaller portions to help you lose weight.</p><p> <strong>  42. Take a nap after lunch. </strong>  A 20-minute midday nap is a habit I have gotten into in my 50&rsquo;s but wish I had started much earlier in life. Keep your nap to less than 30 minutes or you will wake up feeling groggy.</p><p> <strong>  43. Do a good deed every day. </strong>  Practise generosity. Pick up hitchhikers. Hold the door for someone. Pay for the someone else&rsquo;s coffee at the restaurant. Little gestures of kindness go a long way to may someone else&rsquo;s day brighter.</p><p> <strong>  44. Be friendly. </strong>  Speak to strangers. Strangers are only friends you have not yet met. Make it a habit to say &bdquo;good day&rdquo; to at least one stranger every day.</p><p> <strong>  45. Call or message someone every day. </strong>  There are people in your life whose passing would most certainly cause you to shed tears. If you&rsquo;ll cry when they die, why not give while they live? Give them a call. Tell them you appreciate them. Tell them you love them. Make your driving time your calling time. I call my mother at least 3 times a week.</p><p> <strong>  46. Make dinner time your family time. </strong>  Connect with family. Hold hands when you give thanks before the meal. It&rsquo;s a sign of unity and sets the tone for a peaceful enjoyable meal. We do it before every meal time in our home.</p><p> <strong>  47. Reflect on your day. </strong>  Make it a habit every evening to reflect on the day. Were you a blessing to everyone you met? Did you stay focused on your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kubassek.com/3-things-to-help-you-clearly-identify-your-life-purpose/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purpose  </a> </u> ?</p><p> <strong>  48. Turn off your TV. </strong>  For the past 5 years we have not had a television in our home and I can truthfully say that I don&rsquo;t miss it a bit. You can choose to be educated or you can chose to be entertained. Education has a much bigger pay-off.</p><p> <strong>  49. Get a massage once a week. </strong>  I love massages. I don&rsquo;t always make time for a massage every week but I sure feel great when I do. Start with once a month to make this habit easier to adopt.</p><p> <strong>  50. Rest on Sundays and spend time just thinking. </strong>  Even God needed a rest on the 7th day. What&rsquo;s make us think we can go without a day of rest every week. Take time to feed your spirit, rest your body and relax your mind. You deserve it!</p>",

    "link": "schwab-consulting-services-weve-been-touched-on-so-many-different-levels",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> In taking a closer look at Schwab Consulting Services we asked to talk to a few advisors who have been through one or more of the programs Schwab offers for Advisors. One of the firms we spoke to was Westmount Asset Management in Los Angeles. Mike Amash is a senior member of Westmount's investment committee and has been through a number of the consulting service offerings.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Douglas Heikkinen: </strong> Mike, thanks for allowing us to talk to you. To give us some context, we're wondering if you could briefly describe your firm; when you started and what you've seen in terms of growth, both in number of employees and the size of your firm.</p><p> <strong>  Mike Amash: </strong> Sure. I'd be happy to. The firm was founded 25 years ago, in 1990. We started with Schwab from the very beginning, using Schwab as a custodian. We started with zero assets and we are now managing about 2.2 billion in assets on behalf of our clients. I joined the firm 13 years ago. I think I was the 80th employee. The first 12 years, there was significant growth, going from 0 to 250 million and of course the last 13 years has just been better growth. It went from 250 million to 2.2 billion over the last 13 years.</p><p> Really, much of that growth has come in the last 7 or 8 years. That is really the period during which we had to change a lot of things that we were doing to build out our infrastructure, to find a way to scale at the larger level, the same way we were when we were small. When we were smaller, it was pretty easy, you didn't have to hire too many people, you didn't have to change your infrastructure, your systems, very often. So, that growth was easy but over the last 10 years, we had much more significant growth, many more employees in the firm. It's caused us to rely heavily on Schwab for certain management services.</p><p> <strong>  Doug: </strong> Mike, which programs are you working in and how has that been beneficial to Westmount?</p><p> <strong>  Mike: </strong>  The bank marketing studies have always been useful for us and all of the partners will see into that rather deeply. In terms of different areas, it actually stems from last year's IMPACT. We've spent a lot of time with them on the profitability status for our clients. As a researcher to either change our minimum or do income segmentation in terms of our clients service offering. Recently, I spent a lot of time on this internally, just to really dig deeply into finding out what the profitability of the cost of service per client is.</p><p> Honestly, we didn't really know that. We had always guessed on what it was. We didn't have a good methodology for determining it. Typically we take on most clients who get referred to us whether or not they'd met their minimums and whether or not we knew if they were profitable. We realized that was wrong. We've spent a lot of time with their team which was really insightful. It was exactly what we were looking for.</p><p> <strong>  Doug: </strong> Could you describe a little bit more on managing client profitability. How was it helpful for you?</p><p> <strong>  Mike: </strong> We knew what our cost was. We would always divide it up by the amount of clients that we had that were together. We just knew the way we were looking at it was flawed. The way we looked at it, we wouldn't be able to justify more clients, it would bring down our cost of client service. So, we knew we were looking at it in the wrong way and we knew we had to, really, find a formula for the way we think about how we calculated it. That was the genesis of really taking a hard look at it.</p><p> They gave us all the tools to ask the right questions in terms of finding out how many hours were spent from a personnel standpoint. What the offering is for our smaller clients versus our larger clients &mdash; even though we didn't have a defined hybrid or segmented business model? </p><p> Going through this exercise, we were able to quantify what that meant instead of applying the same cost to all of our clients.  We were able to spend all of our time really defining, 'What are we offering these different client segments?' We came up with specific numbers for each of them that we've been offering.</p><p> For us, probably like a lot of firms, we found out that we have a lot of clients that aren't profitable.  We are going to have to make some decisions around that new information, but just to be able to know that was a great first step. Now we can make an informed decision regardless of which direction this is going.</p><p> <strong>  Doug: </strong> What surprised you and your firm about the business consulting offerings? Has it been the depth that they've gone to?</p><p> <strong>  Mike: </strong>  Specifically, the issue of profitability. It seems like such a small or a very narrow issue that somebody would have a program around. It was something that we've been discussing and grappling with effectively for the past few years. I went to this with the thought that there would be a segment or an offering specifically around diving into the profitability of your client section. It wasn't until having attended IMPACT a year ago and seeing a session on this.</p><p> Schwab had an offering exactly around the issue that we picked up that went, now for a few years, that was the genesis of coming back and starting this program eventually and learning more about it. It was really surprising that it's not just on a high level benchmarking, informational level that really gets into the weeds, that your offering really gets into the weeds on multiple different levels. I think that a lot of firms, us included until a certain point, might not even realize how deep and intricate the offering is across different parts of the business. That is just the profitability part.</p><p> <strong>  Doug: </strong> What else jumps out at you?</p><p> <strong>  Mike: </strong>  One of the things that came out of IMPACT that we found extremely useful as well, was, two years ago at IMPACT, hearing Dave Richmond speak. It was so enlightening to sales, even though he is not at Schwab, his emphasis is how to sell and how to be a more effective advisor from a business development standpoint, getting primary referrals, etc. I like to hear their people speak on that subject and typically, they don't offer anything new or they really haven't been in our shoes before where we find it useful. Dave was very different in that sense because everything that he said was exactly what we know and what we do. I found his presentation so useful that Schwab was kind enough to bring it to our office and our whole team here got to meet with him and spend a day with him. It was the same presentation and then we had some follow up work that we had to do with him in terms of re-branding our firm from a sales standpoint and from a business development standpoint.</p><p> <strong>  Doug: </strong> What's in the overall value to the firm in going through these programs?</p><p> <strong>  Mike: </strong> It's hard to quantify because we've been touched by so many different levels. I think the biggest value is just knowing that we have a partner and a resource for most of the challenges that we encounter. I think there's significant value that you know that you have a team behind you that you can draw on during times that you need to. As you grow, you realize, now there's a lot more of that need than there was 10 years ago because they weren't having to change as much or scale as much. Now, we are going through a lot of it, through a lot of, we call it growing pains &mdash; challenges with growth. The need during this phase of our firm, I think, is greater than it's ever been. Going through all of this change with the resources and the partner behind us has been mentally comforting and helpful in making decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Doug: </strong> What was the genesis in getting involved in these programs? Had you heard about it from others that had participated? What was your motivation?</p><p> <strong>  Mike: </strong> Initially, Jim had heard about it from a national study group that we are a part of. Jim, our President, is the one that goes to the study groups. He hears tremendous things from other people who have spoken and who have attended before. Having heard from other people in the study group who had people who had attended it, how well received and the value that they got from it, that he came back excited about it. One of the things, in addition to everything else that we mentioned, some of the challenges, one of the things that we'd been going through is just generational things. We've brought in equity ownership within the firm and we are continuing to do that. We recognize that we are lacking in terms of building the next level of leadership within the firm. So, the two really should go hand in hand as we've brought in equity ownership. When Jim learned of that program from his study group, he came back excited about it and wanted us and wanted me to be able to participate in it.   Then, continue building a deeper team that had the ability to be more, with more broad leadership of the firm in addition to the prior equity ownership. So, we just have a longer sustainable firm that we can grow for gratuity. I'm really looking forward to their leadership program &mdash; which will kick off in January!</p>",

    "link": "accountability-dont-take-the-suckers-bet",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Jim Ware | <a href=\"http://www.focuscgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Focus Group Consulting, Inc.  </u> </a></p><p> <strong>  Many investment firms are taking the sucker&rsquo;s bet on accountability. Is yours? Let&rsquo;s define the sucker&rsquo;s bet. It&rsquo;s an either/or choice, in which both options are bad ones. </strong></p><p> A little like, &ldquo;Have you stopped beating your spouse?&rdquo; Either answer condemns you. The good news with accountability is that a wise choice does exist. But many firms don&rsquo;t see it.</p><p> Accountability is a core value for investment firms. We know this from our survey work. Often it is subsumed in &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; or &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; but it always rises to the top of the &ldquo;must have&rdquo; values. Accountability is linked to fairness. If people are falling short of their goals or shirking their duties altogether, then it seems unfair to let them off the hook (i.e. NOT hold them accountable). In the ideal firm, everyone knows their role and their responsibilities and is properly held accountable for fulfilling them.</p><p> Recently FCG has worked with three excellent investment firms, all with good track records and known brands. In each case, we asked the leaders of the firms, &ldquo;What values would help eliminate sludge and improve results for the firm?&rdquo; We showed them a list of the most common values at investment firms and asked them to vote (using clickers). Here is the vote from one firm, its 50 leaders:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-04-at-10.32.24-AM-2.png\" width=\"467\"/></p><p> Sure enough, accountability is the top vote-getter at 24. (Meaning half the room chose it.) You will notice that the voting candidates are alternately colored blue and black. That&rsquo;s for a reason. In FCG&rsquo;s experience, values fall into one of two broad categories, &ldquo;tough love&rdquo; or &ldquo;TLC: Tender Loving Care.&rdquo; In other words, some values are the tough side of leadership, like holding people accountable, or pushing for more excellence. While others are the supportive side of leadership, like caring and listening. In our &ldquo;crayon simple&rdquo; way, FCG has labeled these sets of values the &ldquo;fist&rdquo; and the &ldquo;open hand.&rdquo; A sample list is shown below:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-04-at-10.47.00-AM-2.png\" width=\"622\"/></p><p> In our view, good leaders understand and practice both sides of this chart. Leadership is situational. Sometimes a staff members needs to feel supported, other times they need a push. Good leaders know when to use each.</p><p> So, what is the vote above telling us? (And remember, this result was nearly identical for three different firms.) Add up the &ldquo;fist&rdquo; votes and the &ldquo;open hand&rdquo; votes and you get these results. 90 votes for the fist, and 44 votes for the open hand. More than double for the tough love. Note: all three firms are really good places to work. Two have won the P&amp;I award for being a &ldquo;great place to work.&rdquo; And in FCG&rsquo;s opinion, they are indeed populated with smart, decent, good people. (The kind of places I would want my daughters to work.)</p><p> Back to the sucker&rsquo;s choice. Why don&rsquo;t these firms simply turn up the volume on the &ldquo;fist&rdquo; in order to achieve the proper balance between fist and open hand? A comment from a participant captured the sucker&rsquo;s choice nicely. He said, &ldquo;So what you are telling us is that we can choose the candy bar in the open hand, or the whip in the closed fist?&rdquo; Bingo. There&rsquo;s the sucker&rsquo;s choice. To put it in cultural terms: we can be a nice place to work, where people are polite and civil, or we can be an abusive sweatshop where people get lashings when they don&rsquo;t perform. And there it is: the sucker&rsquo;s choice. The nice place to work has little accountability and operates sub-optimally, whereas the &ldquo;fist&rdquo; shop whips people into shape, but is a nasty place to work.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the solution? It requires a re-frame on what it means to use the fist. The fist is not whipping people. It&rsquo;s a culture in which the values of precision, discipline, excellence, and candor are understood and practiced. Instead of a whip, picture the fist holding a scalpel. (No! Not for slicing up people!) The scalpel represents surgical precision. Most firms are using butter knives which make for sloppy agreements, fuzzy roles, and blurry decision rights. The surgical scalpel is used to make precise agreements, specific roles, and clear decision rights. An example? After a lengthy discussion, a leader will say, &ldquo;Okay, will one of you follow up on this as soon as possible?&rdquo; Everyone nods. (It would be rude to do otherwise.) This approach is the butter knife. Imprecise and fuzzy. The scalpel approach is different. It follows the &ldquo;Who will do what by when?&rdquo; formula. And it sounds like this: &ldquo;Sarah, will you summarize this discussion on one page with a recommendation at the bottom and send it around to us by 5 pm tomorrow?&rdquo; Now, the candor part of the fist leadership is when Sarah responds, &ldquo;I have three client meetings between now and tomorrow at 5 pm, so unless you want me to reschedule one of them, I am not available to do it.&rdquo; Notice, no one is getting whipped or sliced open, but they are operating with precision and candor.</p><p> Far too many firms consider this fist approach to be rude. Again, that&rsquo;s the sucker&rsquo;s choice: &ldquo;We can be a nice place to work with decent people, or a rude place with hostile people.&rdquo; Wrong. You can be a very nice place to work that also take seriously the values of: accountability, precision, candor, and clarity.</p><p> So, how could you as a leader move your team or firm in this direction? You first identify and agree on the problem: we are out of balance. We are too much the open hand vs. the closed fist. (Like 12 step: &ldquo;My name is John and I&rsquo;m an open hand leader.&rdquo;) Then you start to leverage the open hand values, like appreciation and respect, to highlight and promote the fist values. How? By putting your attention on the examples within the firm that demonstrate good fist behavior. When someone makes a very clear agreement, you acknowledge them publicly: &ldquo;John, I want to appreciate you for that clear agreement you just made. The &ldquo;who, what and when&rdquo; were all identified with precision.&rdquo; Or on the accountability front, you recognize a team member for giving direct feedback about a missed deadline. It might sound like this: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware that we made an agreement to have the RFP ready for this meeting so we could review it. The proposal is not ready. I&rsquo;m curious. What happened?&rdquo; Again, no whipping, no blaming, but clarity around the missed deadline. And curiosity around, why? In these conversations, watch for the appearance of victims, villains and heroes. They sound like this:</p><p> <strong>  Victim: &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t given enough time to finish the RFP. And no one gave me any help. I was left to do it all by myself.&rdquo; (Poor me) </strong></p><p> <strong>  Villain: &ldquo;Why did you accept the assignment if you knew damn well you weren&rsquo;t going to get it done? How do you expect to raise our accountability if you keep acting like this?&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s your fault, you idiot)  </strong></p><p> <strong>  Hero: &ldquo;Now, wait a minute. He gave it his best shot. We&rsquo;re all busy, and sometimes things fall through the cracks. Give us another day, and I&rsquo;ll help him get it done.&rdquo; (Let him off the hook; I&rsquo;ll do it) </strong></p><p> These behaviors are common in cultures dominated by the open hand. They reflect the fact that no one is taking 100% responsibility for the work. The villains and victims each take 0%, they blame others or the circumstances. While the hero takes 200% responsibility, covering for others and taking up the slack. A culture that properly balances the fist and open hand sees less and less of these behaviors and much more candid and clear conversations about accountability. A move towards the fist is a move towards a more mature and courageous culture.</p><p> So, there is a way to balance the fist with the open hand. And a move towards more accountability does not mean that the culture has to become nasty or mean-spirited. Rather, a move towards accountability is a move towards clarity, precision, candor and excellence. FCG recommends that you talk about this shift openly. Explain to the team what you are trying to do: create a culture of accountability. This goal requires a balancing of the two forces: the fist and open hand. Research on great leaders indicates that they practice two fist traits--integrity and responsibility&mdash;and two open hand traits&mdash;compassion and forgiveness. That is the goal of strong leaders. Have both tools in your kit and know when to use each.</p><p> Three important tools must be sharpened if you wish to become a truly accountable organization. First, roles and responsibilities must be clear. Second, the goals for each role must be negotiated and agreed on. Third, feedback must be used to close any gaps. Skillful delivery and receiving of feedback is necessary to close accountability gaps. In one of the firms mentioned in this piece, a senior PM told us, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stopped giving candid feedback because when I do it shows up in my year-end review as being hostile. I get docked in my bonus for not being a team player.&rdquo; Here again is the sucker&rsquo;s choice: polite (but sub-optimal) vs. rude (but more effective). Good leaders will not take the sucker&rsquo;s choice of either/or. Instead, they will opt for both/and. We can be a great place to work with genuinely good and caring people AND create a culture of accountability through practicing candor, precision, and excellence. We can choose the fist AND the open hand. </p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "here-is-how-to-crush-it-in-professional-services-sales",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most professional services firms value sales ability very high &ndash; if you are good at bringing in new business, you&rsquo;ll rise through the ranks faster, make more money and grow your professional track record faster than you ever thought possible.And there&rsquo;s a good reason for that, too: most people find it very hard to combine being a great, professional advisor with being a great, professional seller.It&rsquo;s almost like  &ldquo;never the twain shall meet&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been on both sides of the table &ndash; fortunate enough to buy and sell professional services for close to two decades, and be involved in what probably amounts to several hundred million worth of deals. And over that time, I&rsquo;ve seen how the very best professional services sellers are different &ndash; in six distinctive ways.</p><h3> They Accept They Are In Sales.</h3>When I was a young management consultant, this was probably my toughest challenge: to acknowledge and accept the fact that I was in sales (too). You see, there was a little voice inside telling me &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t go to college, in order to become a salesperson.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a management consultant, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to be selling as well&rdquo;.Over time, I started seeing just how much this attitude was holding me back. And I wasn&rsquo;t alone &ndash; over the years, many have told me they have similar hangups about sales that hold them back from success.The very best, however, understand that sales is just part of what they do &ndash; and perhaps even the most important part. They accept it, and in most cases even enjoy it.<h3> They Act Like Chameleons.</h3>Sirius decisions did an interesting piece a while ago on &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.siriusdecisions.com/Blog/2011/Mar/The-Three-Roles-of-the-B2B-Salesperson.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  The Three Roles Of The B2B Sales Person </u> &rdquo;</a>. According to their findings, they see sellers play three different key roles throughout the sales cycle.<strong> The domain expert</strong> &ndash; buyers want sellers to add value from the very start to the very finish of the sales process. They expect them to be knowledgeable about their industry, circumstances, challenges and potential solutions. In short, they expect those in professional services sales to very much act the part of a trusted advisor.<strong> The strategic orchestrator</strong> &ndash; most complex B2B sales today require a team selling approach, and the very best sellers are able to lead those teams to victory. As strategic orchestrators, sellers are required to marshal resources and align them to the buyers organization.<strong> The risk alleviator</strong> &ndash; as our <u> <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/top-10-factors-separating-sales-winners-from-the-rest/?__hstc=74853325.91aafdd5569101a528b140c93cfba240.1444771367850.1446062177188.1446663440688.5&amp;__hssc=74853325.1.1446663440688&amp;__hsfp=965895689\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  research at RAIN Group </a></u> has shown , one of the top 10 factors that makes buyers decide to work with one firm versus another is &ldquo;because the seller helped me avoid potential pitfalls&rdquo;. Risk is a very important factor in any buying decision today, and the very best professional services sellers not only acknowledge that, but turn it into an advantage.They help buyers accurately assess the levels of financial, solution, vendor and personal risk and suggest ways of mitigating those risks or eliminating them altogether if possible.<h3> They Educate Their Buyers.</h3>For our <u> <a href=\"http://info.rainsalestraining.com/free-report-what-sales-winners-do-differently?__hstc=74853325.91aafdd5569101a528b140c93cfba240.1444771367850.1446062177188.1446663440688.5&amp;__hssc=74853325.1.1446663440688&amp;__hsfp=965895689\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What Sales Winners Do Differently </a></u> research, we at RAIN Group studied over 700 major purchases from buyers who represented $3.1 billion dollars in annual purchasing power. One question we wanted to answer was, &ldquo;Is it the company and offerings that make the biggest difference in the buyer&rsquo;s purchase decision, or is it the seller and how they sell?&rdquo;Guess what: it&rsquo;s the seller and how they sell that most separates sales winners from the rest.Truly outstanding professional services sellers mix the very best of their ability as salespeople with their highest levels of performance as consultants and advisors. According to the <u> <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/top-10-factors-separating-sales-winners-from-the-rest/?__hstc=74853325.91aafdd5569101a528b140c93cfba240.1444771367850.1446062177188.1446663440688.5&amp;__hssc=74853325.1.1446663440688&amp;__hsfp=965895689\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  RAIN Group research </a></u>, the number one factor why these sellers win deals is because they educate their buyers with new ideas and perspectives.The key word here is new &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re truly delivering breakthrough insights, buyers are unlikely to be persuaded by what they see is another &ldquo;me too&rdquo; consultant quoting the last publicly available statistic.<h3> They Build Trust Into The Process.</h3>The traditional sales process is broken &ndash; it is built on assumptions that are simply no longer true. Buyers do not follow a decision-making process. Not all consultants aspire to be great sellers. Factors outside of the span of control of those involved in the buying and selling side often influence whether or not a deal will close.Savvy sellers also understand that <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGXUaUY__VE&amp;feature=share\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  it&rsquo;s never about the first sale </a></u> &ndash; it&rsquo;s about building a relationship, a foundation that will serve them and their clients for years to come. In other words, they focus on building trust &ndash; not closing a sale.My friend and esteemed colleague Charles Green has identified <u> <a href=\"http://trustedadvisor.com/articles/selling-professional-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  five steps in the trust building process </a></u>:<li> <strong>  Engage </strong>  the client in an open discussion  about issues that are key to the client;</li><li> <strong>  Listen </strong>  to what is  important  and  real  to the client; listen at three levels&mdash;get the data,  affirm the importance  of that data to the client, and  demonstrate  you  recognize  it;earn the right to engage in a  true dialogue .</li><li> <strong>  Frame </strong>  the true  root  issue,  without the language of blame , via caveats, problem statements and hypotheses; pursue  radical truth-telling in socially acceptable terms ; reduce risk by taking risks&mdash;articulate a point of view; create by giving away.</li><li> <strong>  Envision </strong>  an  alternative  reality, including  win-win  specific descriptions of outcomes and results, including emotional and political states; clarify benefits&mdash;make clear what&rsquo;s at stake; be tangible about future states.</li><li> <strong>  Commit </strong>  to actionable next steps that imply significant commitment and movement on the part of each party.</li><h3> They Communicate The Value Of What They Are Selling.</h3>Whenever I&rsquo;m asked whether consultants can sell, my answer is always the same. Not only can they sell, but they are better positioned than virtually anyone else to do so.Why ? Because consultants possess a unique skill set.Consultants are excellent at key parts of the sales process, including: defining the problem, identifying and testing potential solutions, pinpointing obstacles that are likely to occur in collaborating in finding the best approach to moving forward.In short, <u> consultants are uniquely positioned</u> to communicate the full value of what they can deliver to clients &ndash; thereby maximizing the potential for the client to want to move forward, and move forward with them.<h3> They Minimise Uncertainty And Encourage Action.</h3>Because of their background and experience, many of those in professional services sales understand that with business comes a certain level of ambiguity. Commerce is complex, and decisions often have to be made with very little information and input, which may have a disproportionate impact on the outcomes and success of any project. Many consultants are great at finding ways to minimise uncertainty &ndash; thereby encouraging their clients to take action, and increasing the chances of them doing so.<u> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1966/03/how-to-buysell-professional-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  According to HBR </a></u>, &ldquo;the feeling of uncertainty will not necessarily be overtly articulated by very many clients. But it is there.&rdquo;Three kinds of uncertainty can be distinguished:&ldquo;First, there is the basic uncertainty of knowing with whom to deal and on whom to rely. In other words, the client who is interested in getting some assistance via a professional service is faced with the problem of where to get it. He has a number of alternatives open to him. Because of the large sums of money involved in the purchase of the services themselves, there is also uncertainty as to whether these monies are being wisely spent. I am referring to such expenditures as those for large-scale research undertakings, costly consultants, or commissions or fees paid for services. In most instances the amounts eventually at stake are still larger.&rdquo;&ldquo;Finally, there is even more uncertainty in the problem itself. This problem is why the buyer of professional services is seeking advice or assistance in the first place. Whether the problem is in marketing, finance, personnel, research and development, or what, it is without question the single most important of the three sources of uncertainty.&rdquo;Those who succeed is successfully marrying the skill set and competencies of the great consultants with those of the great seller are poised for success. The true rainmakers in any organization are admired, valued and almost always first in line when it comes to future opportunities for their career development.Yet, most firms are plagued by the same phenomenon: a relatively small number of individuals bring in a disproportionate amount of all business. By following the six principles outlined above, you now have the option to choose to become one of them. ",

    "title": "Understanding Alternative Investing Through Asymmetric Payoffs",
    "link": "understanding-alternative-investing-through-asymmetric-payoffs",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<strong> Investing in alternative investment vehicles are typically attractive to investors due to their lower correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds</strong>. The idea is that the ability of alternative vehicles to invest in non-traditional asset classes can help protect investment portfolios against sharp downturns while also participating in positive markets. The purported goal is to change the relation of the portfolio to the equity market from a linear, symmetric profile (up when markets are up, down when markets are down) to a more asymmetric profile.Given that, it would be valuable to discern the relationship between returns from alternative vehicles, such as hedge funds, and equity markets. Instead of simply looking at traditional performance metrics (returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, drawdowns, etc) we use a different lens to understand the performance of alternatives and try to answer two questions:<li> Do alternatives in fact provide asymmetric payoffs, and if so</li><li> Is the relationship convex (up when equity markets are up and flat when equity markets are down) or concave (flat when equity markets are up and down when equity markets are up)?</li><h3> <strong>  Background </strong></h3>A GMO whitepaper from 2011 (<u> <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/153540/gmo--rethinking-risk-what-the-beta-puzzle-tells-us-about-investing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  link </a></u>) described a different framework for thinking about risk and return while discussing the beta puzzle: low beta stocks have historically matched or beaten broad equity market returns, and with significantly lower volatility. On the other hand, high beta stocks have under-performed while being more volatile. This would be appear to be anomalous to finance theory (and intuition) that long-term returns should be proportionate with the amount of risk taken i.e. more risk = more reward. As the authors note, a number of strategies, including risk parity, attempt to take advantage of this apparent exploitable anomaly.The paper lays out the important role that asymmetric payoffs play in determining the risk and return characteristics of investment strategies. High beta stocks have convex payoffs but this comes at a substantial cost that hurts returns &ndash; think buying call options or adding put options to an equity portfolio. Low beta stocks exhibit concave payoffs and essentially &lsquo;get paid&rsquo; to take downside exposure. Similarly, hedge fund returns (which carry a low beta) can be traced to the downside market exposure they have. Academics have in fact found that hedge fund return series are not significantly different from a mechanical strategy that writes puts on the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1910719\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> link</a>).In the next section we explore the asymmetric payoffs of hedge fund returns, similar to the GMO study, but with data updated through 2015.<h3> <strong>  The Asymmetry of Hedge Fund Returns </strong></h3>We consider monthly data between January 1990 and August 2015 for the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, which includes fees. The following figure shows a scatter plot of monthly returns for the HFRI index versus S&amp;P 500 returns.A best-fit curve to the above data indicates that monthly hedge fund returns have a concave profile relative to market returns (as seen in the negative coefficient for the quadratic term). The goodness of fit (R-squared) term for the curve is 0.56, and is higher than that obtained when we try a linear fit to the data. What this tells us is that when the equity market is negative, hedge fund returns are also negative but when equity markets rise, the upside for hedge funds is capped.To relate the concave payoff structure of hedge fund returns to another strategy with concave payoffs, and one that uses options, we consider a covered call strategy. This is a classic example of a strategy with a concave payoff structure &ndash; the upside is capped while the downside is shared with the underlying (though to a slightly less degree since one collects a premium when writing the option).We chose the CBOE S&amp;P 500 BuyWrite benchmark index instead of constructing a strategy that involves actual options data since the index data goes back to the start of our hedge fund return series. For now, the idea is to simply compare payoff structures stylistically. The BuyWrite Index tracks the performance of a hypothetical covered call strategy on the S&amp;P 500 that involves<li> <strong>  Buying an S&amp;P 500 index portfolio, and </strong></li><li> <strong>  Selling (or &ldquo;writing&rdquo;) a near-term, slightly out-of-the money call option on the S&amp;P 500 index. </strong></li>A scatter plot relating monthly returns for the BuyWrite index to S&amp;P 500 returns and a best-fit curve confirms the concavity of returns, and is very similar to what we saw earlier when relating hedge fund returns to the market.Both strategies exhibit seemingly lower &lsquo;risk&rsquo; characteristics &ndash; the beta value over the entire period for the HFRI index and the BuyWrite index are 0.34 and 0.62, respectively. Similarly, the full-period correlation between the HFRI index and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.74, compared to a correlation of 0.88 between the BuyWrite index and the S&amp;P 500. However, it is not the case that either of these strategies are &lsquo;safer&rsquo; since their exposure to the market increases in negative markets relative to their exposure to up markets.We explore this further by looking at realized betas and correlations for these two strategies in three different market environments &ndash; when the S&amp;P 500 falls more than 3% in a month, rises more than 3% in a month and is flat (between -3% and 3% monthly return).We see that realized beta for both strategies is highest when market returns are the most negative, and fall quite sharply when market returns are flat or high. For the HFRI index, realized beta drops from more than 0.45 during significant down markets to less than 0.15 during significant up markets. Realized beta for the BuyWrite index falls from close to 1 during large negative markets to almost 0.6 during large positive markets. Note that the beta value for this index is higher during the positive months than flat months because the strategy writes options on slightly out-of-the-money options (as opposed to at-the-money options), giving it some exposure to the upside.A similar story plays out when we look at correlations between the strategies and the S&amp;P 500 in these various regimes. Highest correlations occur during the most negative market regime.The HFRI index correlation with the S&amp;P 500 is about 0.7 during negative markets, but falls to about 0.2 when markets are positive. The overall correlations for the BuyWrite index with the S&amp;P 500 are higher across all the various market regimes but we do see a similar fall in values when moving from negative to positive markets, albeit to a lesser extent than the corresponding drop for the HFRI index.What the above results tell us is that investing in hedge funds is akin to a covered call strategy. In large negative markets, one gets to hold on to the option premium (received when selling the call) but remain fully exposed to the downside. However these strategies fail to participate in large up markets since the upside has been exchanged for a premium.As the authors of the GMO whitepaper note, the asymmetry of payoffs has important implications.<li> <strong>  Be wary of beta as a measure of risk, since this measure clearly downplays the real risks that are taken. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The volatility and diversification benefits that alternative strategies like hedge funds offer comes from altering the payoff structure when markets go up, as opposed to taking on different risks. </strong></li>An obvious question at this point is, why not simply utilize a strategy that has convex payoffs, say by buying puts in a long equity strategy to protect against large down markets. The short answer is the famous adage &ldquo;There is no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo;. Tail-risk protection strategies come at a premium cost, which can severely detract from long-term returns &ndash; see <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/the-cost-of-tail-risk-protection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> this post</a>.In the next few posts we will go over the cost of adding convexity to a strategy and explore approaches that can &lsquo;tame&rsquo; black-swans &ndash; strategies that provide convex payoffs while also earning reasonable long-term returns.",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  If you find yourself constantly resorting to generic answers when people ask you questions about yourself, it may be time to rethink your approach </strong> . So often we drift through our day, not even seeing the opportunities we have in conversations with others. From the simplest &ldquo;Hey, how are you?&rdquo; to the more complex questions you are asked throughout your work day &mdash; <strong>  how often do you take time to answer the questions fully? </strong></p><p> A critical question we so often shy away from answering in a powerful way and one that can open doors to a world of opportunity is: <strong>  &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> I have heard even the most seasoned professionals use the old standard, black and white description of their business. As an example they answer: &ldquo;I am a financial advisor.&rdquo; Although you are concisely stating exactly what you do with that answer, <strong>  you are also opening the door for all of the stereotypes and preconceived notions they associate with that title or profession. </strong> For many, you would be tossed into the broad category of salesperson and forgotten in their minds. Simply said: The real benefits are being left open to hope (I sure hope they know what a financial advisor does). But in order for action, they must want what you have &mdash; and it&rsquo;s your job to make them want it!</p><p> However, talking about yourself and your products with more detail often comes across as sales-y or boastful or meaningless. For example, if a financial advisor says, &ldquo;I hold the CFA designation.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s great&hellip;but what does that really mean to the person you are talking with?</p><p> Instead, try using a phrase that I have heard some top advisors use. Follow the black and white feature statement with an absolute home run connector statement that gives you the right to talk about your expertise or other benefits of your services. For instance: &ldquo;I hold the CFA designation. And let me tell you why I think that may be important to you.&rdquo;</p><p> The statement, &ldquo;And let me tell you why I think that may be important to you&rdquo; gives you the right to share why something may be important to them. It will still be a factual description of what you do &mdash; but this time with meaning directly for the person you&rsquo;re talking with. And it may just be the opportunity to put preconceived notions to rest and build your value &mdash; without coming across &ldquo;sales-y.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Successful people just do more things than others do. They take more action; they are not risk averse. Clear goals drive their activity. They stay busy working on the right things at the right time. They also have important common characteristic: They take action.</p><p> Tom Peters, the author of  &ldquo;In Search of Excellence&rdquo; , reported in this book that an important common quality of the executives he observed was what he called a &ldquo;bias for action.&rdquo; They realized that the future belonged to those who were action-oriented, willing to take the right risks at the right time and committed to following a plan.</p><p> Having clear and specific plans are necessary to make sure that whatever action you take is effective and achieves the desired outcome. A plan also makes it easy for you to pay attention to the details as well as the big picture. Here are five key points to take into account when you are ready to &ldquo;act&rdquo;:</p><li> <strong>  Set Checkpoints </strong>  &ndash; All action should be built around a plan and for the plan to work you need to have interim checkpoints to measure progress.</li><li> <strong>  Responsibility and Roles </strong>  &ndash; For any plan and the needed action to be successful, everyone must know the following: What they must do, by when, how to do it and why they do it.</li><li> <strong>  Ground Rules </strong>  &ndash; Make sure everyone knows the parameters of their responsibilities; when they should seek help and how problems need to be resolved.</li><li> <strong>  Feedback </strong>  &ndash; Make certain that periodic, objective and specific feedback is given when needed. People work best when they are communicated with about their performance and what they can do to either sustain it or improve it.</li><li> <strong>  Celebrate </strong>  &ndash; When the goal has been achieved, celebrate and recognize it. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a &ldquo;state dinner&rdquo; type celebration. Just take the time to recognize what&rsquo;s been done and say thank you. <br/>  </li><p> The most important single factor needed to act effectively is &ldquo;self-discipline&rdquo;. Whenever I talk about self-discipline, I always refer to the definition offered by Thomas Huxley (1825-1895) which states,  &ldquo;Self-discipline is doing what you&rsquo;re supposed to do, when you&rsquo;re supposed to do it even though you may not feel like doing it.&rdquo;  Even small steps acted upon in a consistent manner will lead you to success. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolynabrent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Carolyn A Brent  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.caregiverstory.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Care Giver Resource Center  </u> </a></p><h3> It&rsquo;s a sad reality that, as we age, we become less independent than we once were &ndash; but for most blessed with longevity, it&rsquo;s inevitable. With multiple millions of baby boomers throughout the U.S. caring for elderly parents, throngs of adult caregivers struggle with determining if their parent is fit to remain living alone.  It&rsquo;s a difficult, multi-faceted decision not to be made lightly as there is much at stake&ndash;both the physical and emotional well-being of the parent in question and for the extended family at large.</h3><p> <br/> To help ease the process of determining if an elderly parent should no longer live on their own, here are 10 tell-tale signs that can give you better peace of mind with making this all-important decision as offered by aging and elder care authority and legislation advocate, Carolyn A.  Brent, MBA--award-winning author of the acclaimed title, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Boomers-Preparing-Emotionally-Financially-Legally/dp/0615475019\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why Wait? The Baby Boomers' Guide to Preparing Emotionally, Financially &amp; Legally for a Parents' Death  </a> </u> &rdquo;&ndash;a book that helps caregivers discern, discuss and deal with crucial end-of-life issues within their families ( <a href=\"http://www.caregiverstory.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.CareGiverStory.com </a> ):</p><h3> 1. Mom or Dad has always been a great housekeeper, but the house just doesn&rsquo;t look like it used to</h3><p> You may remember a parent who was constantly on you about tidying your room or putting things away after you were done with them. The house was always spotless and everything was organized, clean and in its place.  There was much pride in this fact. However, upon visiting with Mom or Dad today the home is decidedly cluttered and not nearly as clean as normal.  Of course, this can mean a lot of things. Your parent may actually have an active social life and is more concerned with staying busy than tidying up. But, it could be a more ominous sign that your parent is having a difficult time keeping up with all the chores. She may feel overwhelmed or his physical health is slowing him down. Ask your parent if help is needed with the clutter, but do it in a nonchalant way that could prompt a conversation indicating assistance is needed here. Keep a keen eye to discern if the clutter and filth is getting worse with each visit - it&rsquo;s often a key sign.  </p><h3> 2. The bills and other mail are piling up</h3><p> While we all get busy &ndash; even those who are retired &ndash;basic tasks that were often dealt with quickly and easily when younger, but that are now falling by the wayside, is a sign that your older parent could be getting overwhelmed and not able to manage their daily affairs. This may also indicate some signs of forgetfulness and memory issues. Often, especially if a parent is alone without a spouse, they may not have someone to remind them to go through the mail and check to see if it&rsquo;s time to pay certain bills.</p><h3> 3. The checking account balance is wrong and bills are going unpaid</h3><p> If the mail, with bills included, is piling up, there is a good chance that the bills are not getting paid. You may also discover amongst mail issues that your parent&rsquo;s checking account ledger balance is wrong or in arrears. These are also signs that your parent is having memory issues or difficulty with simple math cognition. It can also indicate a general apathy &ndash; a mindset that can be equally problematic for someone with the glut of responsibility required to effectively live alone.</p><h3> 4. Your parent is losing a lot of weight</h3><p> A parent who may have lost their partner or who is generally depressed often loses interest in eating due to a reduced appetite. They may feel that it is not worth the hassle of shopping for and preparing meals if they are now living all alone. Accordingly, pay close attention to your parent&rsquo;s weight. Also, check their refrigerator and pantry to see if there is an appropriate supply of food and that what is there is fresh and edible. If the cupboard is bare and your parent&rsquo;s frame is shrinking, living alone might become problematic. At the very least, you may want to think about bringing groceries by or looking into a service that offers prepared meal delivery. Otherwise, you may have to think about putting them somewhere that helps them eat regular, healthy meals.</p><h3> 5. They have forgotten the basics of hygiene</h3><p> If you notice that your parent is wearing the same clothing day in and day out or that their hair or skin appears dirty on a fairly regular basis, they may have lost the motivation, ability and/or forethought to look after them self. Living alone, they may feel like they don&rsquo;t have to dress up or clean up for anyone. Worse yet, they may have forgotten &ndash; or simply no longer cares - that such personal hygiene and cleanliness is an important part of daily living and maintaining one&rsquo;s good health.</p><h3> 6. They appear in inappropriate clothing</h3><p> While you may not share your mother or father&rsquo;s sense of style, there is cause for concern if your parent dons summer clothing in the dead of winter or leaves the house in a nightgown and slippers for a trip to the store. This often happens when the elderly are suffering from confusion and lose the ability to have discretion in social situations. In this situation, wardrobe can be the least of the concerns as the problem manifests in other dangerous ways.</p><h3> 7. There are signs of forgetfulness in the home</h3><p> Confusion can also show up in the kitchen and can prove to be deadly if not dealt with quickly. All too often there are stories of older people who accidentally burned their houses down because they left a pot on the stove for hours and fell asleep or have flooded the home when they forgot to turn off the tap. Or, perhaps more subtly, the milk is in the pantry and the bread is in the refrigerator. These are all tell-tale signs that it may not be wise for your parent to be left home alone for extended periods of time.</p><h3> 8. Your parent regularly misses appointments and other important items</h3><p> Forgetfulness, absentmindedness and memory issues may also show up when it comes to keeping certain appointments, recognizing key dates, or, even more importantly, maintaining medication dosages on schedule. This is a clear sign they need to live with someone who can help them stick to their schedules and stay on task.</p><h3> 9. They are just acting plain weird</h3><p> This is always the sign that families dread the most. No one wants to turn into the &ldquo;crazy cat lady&rdquo; or the &ldquo;man who mutters to himself.&rdquo; But, unfortunately, between aging, mental degradation and the side effects from medication, you may note that your parent has lost their personalities and behavior has taken an odd turn for the worse. If you see signs of paranoia, fear, strange phone calls and conversations and nervousness, this should not be overlooked as it&rsquo;s a blatant sign that living assistance is in order.</p><h3> 10. They exhibit signs of depression</h3><p> There are a number of classic signs that can be connected with someone suffering depression. A loss of interest in caring for one&rsquo;s self as well as a lack of participation in socialization and in once-loved hobbies can mean that your parent needs treatment or should reside in an environment where they can be around other people. Sometimes, depression comes from a sense of loneliness or the realization that they can no longer do things for themselves. Putting them somewhere that offers assistance, socialization and activities can help cure the loneliness and put them back on track to a more fulfilling, active and engaged life. </p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve interviewed more than eleven thousand people in my life. I&rsquo;ve worked with and interacted with countless more. It never ceases to amaze me the consistency across individuals, positions, industries, and any other variable you can imagine when it comes to sabotaging careers.</p><p> The good news is I&rsquo;ve highlighted what I consider the seven worst career mistakes you continue to make. Sometimes, simply knowing what the problem is can help cure it. In other instances, it&rsquo;ll take more effort.</p><p> Here we go&hellip;</p><h3> Not networking outside your company</h3><p> <br/> Even if you&rsquo;re the most popular person in your ten-thousand-person company, you need to continually connect with others outside your organization. I&rsquo;d extend this to getting to know people outside your profession. Going through life as a team-of-one will get you nowhere fast. Check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/how-to-build-your-professional-network/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Build Your Professional Network  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/youre-only-as-strong-as-your-network-4-keys-to-building-relationships/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   You&rsquo;re Only as Strong as Your Network&mdash;4 Keys to Building Relationships  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Not taking the leap</h3><p> <br/> Most people operate from a failure-avoidance position when they should be approaching it from the I&rsquo;ll-make-it-happen perspective. Not taking a chance on something you love will be your biggest regret in life. See  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/figure-purpose-life-fewer-600-words/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How to Figure Out Your Purpose in Life in Fewer Than 600 Words  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/5-requirements-for-a-successful-career-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Requirements for a Successful Career Change  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Not knowing your value</h3><p> <br/> This is a two-parter. It amazes me that few people truly understand what they earn. It&rsquo;s a bit less astonishing that people don&rsquo;t understand their value in the market. First, get a grip on your current value by checking out  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/know-financial-value-changing-jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Know Your Financial Value Before Changing Jobs  </a> </u> . Second, do some investigating outside your company to see what others in your profession are earning.</p><h3> Not keeping up with the latest trends</h3><p> <br/> Staying behind the latest curves makes you appear uniformed when interacting with people outside your organization (maybe even inside). This, of course, becomes harmful when you are job interviewing. Start reading more blogs for your profession. Keep reading mine no matter your profession. </p><h3> Overestimating what you can accomplish today and underestimating what you can achieve in your lifetime</h3><p> <br/> How many to-do&rsquo;s can you accomplish today? Tomorrow morning, count the ones you didn&rsquo;t accomplish. Were your eyes bigger than your stomach? Why do you think at any moment you can do more, but over your lifetime think you&rsquo;ll achieve less? Start writing that New York Times Bestseller. Draft that screenplay. Build your company. Determine how you&rsquo;ll get your message out to millions of people. Incremental, directed change today will accumulate exponentially as time goes by.</p><h3> You quit your job search because you&rsquo;re newly employed or happily employed or both</h3><p> <br/> I assure you, your dream job will never come floating along right when you need it to. Remain open and never rest on a steady paycheck or stop networking (see above). Today&rsquo;s market is not your parents&rsquo; market and it&rsquo;s definitely not your grandparents&rsquo; market. We are operating in an attention-deficit-disorder world. Whether it&rsquo;s your or your employer&rsquo;s fault is irrelevant. Protect yourself.</p><h3> You think you need a boss or mentor or anyone other than yourself to direct your career</h3><p> <br/> You can outsource a lot of things in your life, but your career isn&rsquo;t one of them. Own it. Take steps. Take chances. Make mistakes. Repeat. Before you know it, I&rsquo;ll be reading about you, what you accomplished, and how it&rsquo;s improved the world!</p><p> As always, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you: What do you consider the greatest career killers?</p>",

    "content": "<p> We went to satisfy nostalgic curiosity.  Having grown up in the 80&rsquo;s, even though we were raised on opposite ends of the country, my husband and I share memories of big hair, Van Halen, and the Lake Placid Olympics.  So when we found ourselves in upstate NY a few years ago, we seized the opportunity to explore.  I will never look at the ski jump the same way again.</p><p> We started at the bottom, looking up.  Lake Placid has two ski jumps, the taller of the two, pictured on the right, loomed 120 meters high.  To be honest, it didn&rsquo;t look real.  Without snow, without the crowds, and without seeing it from the safety of my television, I had no frame of reference for the behemoth I was seeing.  I couldn&rsquo;t get my mind wrapped around the reality that there are some human beings in the world who would make their way to the top of this thing, willingly point themselves downhill, and go&hellip;</p><p> And that was before I took the elevator up the 22 stories to the top.</p><p> Now I&rsquo;m not sure what would possess someone to take on this sport.   No amount of breathing could release me from the anxiety I was feeling as I peered down from the top of the clouds.  What became absolutely clear as I absorbed my surroundings, is that once you went for it, there was no turning back.   You were committed.</p><p> And then I understood, in a microscopic way, why someone might find that appealing.</p><p> Because we don&rsquo;t commit like that in life.  We give ourselves a way out.</p><p> <strong>  We don&rsquo;t fully commit in life.  We give ourselves a way out.   </strong></p><p> We hold back our best, until we know it&rsquo;s safe.  We don&rsquo;t force ourselves to have the tough conversations &ndash; to say what&rsquo;s real.  We say we&rsquo;ll do anything and work with anyone, without having the courage to declare what we do best and with whom we wish to work.  We go through employees like Kleenex in a box &ndash; if one doesn&rsquo;t work out, we just go on to the next.  We don&rsquo;t fully commit.  Not to our businesses.  Not to our colleagues, or employees.  And maybe most importantly, not to ourselves.</p><p> In the theatre, one of the most dangerous things you can do as an actor, is to not fully commit.  If you&rsquo;re not 100% committed, quite honestly, you stink.  Your performance is phony or boring, which means you&rsquo;re often unemployed.   But to fully commit, is scary.  You have to allow yourself to be so incredibly vulnerable, to not hold anything back, and to be completely present in the moment.  If you stand outside yourself, worried about looking foolish, or making a mistake &ndash; if you&rsquo;re focusing on what others think, on their judgements &ndash; you&rsquo;ve lost.  The magic is gone.</p><p> In the ski jump, it seems to me the stakes are higher.  If you&rsquo;re jumping and you don&rsquo;t commit, unemployment is likely the least of your worries&hellip;</p><p> And what if we were to fully commit ourselves like that?  Like there is no out.  Like our life depended on it?</p><p> <strong>  What if we were to fully commit ourselves like there is no out.  Like our life depended on it? </strong></p><p> If we&rsquo;re really  committing  to being our best, what would that look like?  Who would we spend our time with?  What would we be doing?  How would we care for ourselves?</p><p> If we&rsquo;re  committing  to providing the best service, what would that look like?  Who would our partners be?  What kind environment makes it possible for people to bring their best?  What kind of clients find value in the best we bring?</p><p> If we&rsquo;re  committing  to building a world-class organization, what would that look like?  How would we hire?  How would we show up in meetings?  How would we develop our people?  How would we treat one another, if we were to treat everyone in the organization as if they were world-class?</p><p> Because maybe we live under a false sense of security.  Maybe the stakes really are that high.  For if we do life with one foot in and one foot out, should we be surprised to find our results in a heap at the base of our mountainous effort?</p><p> Perhaps the uncomfortable truth is that we cannot soar if we don&rsquo;t fully commit.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  When we empower employees, does that impact their productivity? </strong> <br/> <br/> Employee empowerment is one of those phrases that often causes people to groan. Is it just another piece of employee lingo or a catch phrase? No, absolutely not. It's an important concept to both reducing  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.intradiem.com/employee-effort-spinning-wheels/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employee effort  </a> </u>  and increasing employee engagement. When employees feel empowered, they are in charge of reducing their own effort and responsible for engaging with the business. <br/> <br/> But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me first define empowerment. According to Google, it means, quite simply: to give (someone) the authority or power to do something. <br/> <br/> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/empowerment.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BusinessDictionary.com  </a> </u> , it is: <br/> <br/> A management practice of sharing information, rewards, and power with employees so that they can take initiative and make decisions to solve problems and improve service and performance. <br/> <br/> Empowerment is based on the idea that giving employees skills, resources, authority, opportunity, motivation, as well holding them responsible and accountable for outcomes of their actions, will contribute to their competence and satisfaction. <br/> My own thoughts on it? I wrote  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/05/employee-empowerment.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   previously  </a> </u> :</p> From the employee perspective, it's about responsibility, <u> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/06/employee-ownership.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ownership </a></u>, and <u> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/03/cem-toolbox-employee-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  accountability </a></u>. It's also about <u> <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/12/define-your-employee-centric-culture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  trust </a></u>; the employee is given the keys to the castle and trusted to do what's right for the customer and for the business. Empowerment means never having to ask, \"Is it OK if I do this for my customer?\" Empowerment means not having to ask for permission.<p> <br/> You might be starting to get a glimpse into how and why empowerment and productivity are related. <br/> <br/> When employees are empowered, they walk around with a sense of ownership, thinking and acting like they own the business. When you own a business, you put your heart and soul into it, into making it succeed. Empowered employees don't stand on the sidelines waiting to be spoon-fed; they know what to do. They take the horse by the reins and run with the directive (aka the brand promise), being accountable for their roles in the execution of the customer experience and in the success of the business. They work together with others who are just as passionate and who share a common goal. These things combined result in efficiencies from a variety of angles. <br/> <br/> An empowered organization is one in which individuals have the knowledge, skill, desire, and opportunity to personally succeed in a way that leads to collective organizational success. -Stephen Covey  <br/> <br/> So, benefits of employee empowerment include:</p><li> Unleashing a sense of ownership and pride in their work</li><li> Improving the employee experience</li><li> Boosting employee satisfaction </li><li> Increasing employee loyalty</li><li> Encouraging collaboration and teamwork</li><li> Unleashing employee creativity</li><li> Increasing employee productivity</li><li> Improving work output/quality </li><li> And more, including cost benefits, as well <br/>  </li><p> Empowered employees become \"better, \" more conscientious, employees overall. So it would seem that empowerment is a pretty important thing - to your employees and to the organization. How, then, do we empower our employees?</p><li> Define what empowerment means within your organization, to set some boundaries</li><li> Set expectations </li><li> Train, communicate, provide a framework, and then let employees do their jobs</li><li> Trust employees to make the right choices and the right decisions for your customers </li><li> Provide feedback and coaching so that employees to know if they are on the right track</li><li> Define what \"doing right\" means and what it looks like</li><li> Ensure employees have the knowledge, skills, and training to do what you're expecting of them</li><li> Define and reinforce what a great customer experience is and what it means for the customer and to the business</li><li> Ensure that employees have a clear line of sight to the customer</li><li> And ensure they know how they impact business outcomes </li><li> Lose the script; empowered employees don't need a script</li><li> Allow for common sense, but don't necessarily rely on it (since not everyone has it!)</li><li> Remind employees that going the extra mile doesn't have to cost a dime; customers want you to listen and act, to do what makes sense <br/>  </li><p> It seems like there's a lot to do in order to empower employees, but it is important that we reduce any vagueness and that we really set appropriate expectations about what that means. They need to understand your vision and the desired outcomes. And then be allowed to execute. <br/> <br/> The best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick good men to do what he wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it. -Theodore Roosevelt</p>",

    "content": "<p> It may seem unbelievable, but the end of the year is quickly approaching. But before we say goodbye to 2015, know that there&rsquo;s still time to make most of this year &mdash; especially in your financial life! You can start by making these money moves before the clock strikes midnight on December 31.</p><p> The following actions will help you maximize your savings, take advantage of tax breaks, and prepare yourself for 2016. You can start the new year off on a the right financial footing, and give yourself a little boost on any money-related resolutions you might want to keep next year.</p><h3> Consider Maxing Out Your 401(k)</h3><p> <br/> You can contribute up to $18,000 in  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-handle-your-year-end-bonus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your 401(k) plan  </a> </u>  in 2015, so if you haven&rsquo;t contributed that max consider doing so before December 31. Some employers offer free money in the form of a 401(k) match, where they match every dollar you contribute to your 401(k) up to a certain amount. Don&rsquo;t let this money get away! In addition, contributing to your 401(k) also reduces your taxable income, which could put you in a more favorable tax bracket.</p><p> At the same time, determine if you could contribute additional money to  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/401k-vs-roth-ira-which-is-right-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your Traditional or Roth IRA  </a> </u> . With these IRAs, you contribute a maximum of $5,500 if you&rsquo;re under 50, and $6,500 if you&rsquo;re over 50. A traditional IRA reduces your taxable income immediately, whereas a Roth IRA is money you&rsquo;ve invested after-taxes.</p><h3> Spend Down Your Flex Plan</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s time to use it or lose it. Some employer-offered  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/hsas-and-fsas-and-healthcare-costs-oh-my/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   flexible savings accounts  </a> </u>  require you to spend all the money you&rsquo;ve accumulated over the year before December 31. Don&rsquo;t let this money slip through your fingers simply because you didn&rsquo;t visit the doctor enough.</p><p> Not sure what you can spend your flexible savings account on? Check out this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000178885\" target=\"_blank\">   list of approved expenses  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Reevaluate Your Company Benefits</h3><p> <br/> Around this time of year, many Human Resources departments are sending out healthcare plan information. Whether or not your healthcare coverage is changing, review your company benefits as whole and see if the plan you have right now works best for your family.</p><p> For instance, if you&rsquo;re a single person with few health issues, you may be paying too much for a gold-level plan. Do you really need access to 20,000 doctors throughout the nation? You may if you travel a lot, but you may also be covered just as well by a healthcare plan that offers a Health Savings Account.</p><p> Review your options now before plan coverage kicks in on January 1.</p><h3> Evaluate Your Investment Portfolio</h3><p> <br/> As we close out the year, it&rsquo;s time to check out your portfolio and evaluate its performance. This year had some ups and downs, so you could have either gained or lost money this year. Depending on your situation, discuss with your tax professional or Certified Financial Planner and see if it would benefit you to do  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax-loss harvesting  </a> </u> . </p><p> If you do decide to sell some of your investments, the end of the year is also a good time to ensure your portfolio is balanced with a diversified mix of investments. Again, how you balance your portfolio will depend on your situation, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/money-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your tax professional or CFP  </a> </u>  can give you more guidance.</p><h3> Make Charitable Donations</h3><p> <br/> The end of the year is a great time to review any charitable contributions you&rsquo;ve made throughout the year and determine if you could (or want to) do more, and consider maxing out other investment plans you have. Many people donate to charity throughout the year, so gather up any receipts you&rsquo;ve collected, especially the ones Goodwill or other donation centers have provided you. You may realize you still have the capacity to donate more, and get a deduction for your charity.</p><h3> Review Your Income</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve seen an  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/4-steps-for-negotiating-your-next-pay-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   increase in your income  </a> </u>  or expect to see an increase the following year, you may want to see if your current traditional IRA is right for you. Depending on your current income and your projected income in the future, a Roth IRA conversion may be a better option.</p><p> Roth IRAs are particularly good for younger employees, who will likely be in a higher tax bracket in the future. But it&rsquo;s best to evaluate your future plans before making this decision. </p><p> The money moves you make before December 31 may differ slightly, depending on your current situation and any anticipated changes in 2016. If you&rsquo;re expecting an addition to your family, you may want to consider investing in a college savings 529 plan, where you can save money in a tax-advantaged account for college expenses.</p><p> Or you may anticipate a big medical procedure you&rsquo;re having done in 2016 and may want to increase your contributions to a Health Savings Account or your Flexible Spending Account. Considering these financial costs will help you set up accounts and plan out your savings throughout 2016.</p><p> By considering these money moves before December 31, you will put yourself on solid ground for 2016. </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Are you brave enough to lead? What if you just did it anyway? Here, tips for feeling the fear and leading anyway.</p><p> At my high school graduation, I did something a bit unexpected. One of a handful of student speakers, I walked up to the podium, took a deep breath, and proceeded to sing a peppy little song I had written for my class. I am not a singer (not for lack of trying!) and who knows what possessed me to stand in the arena in Duluth, Minnesota and sing to my class. But I did.</p><p> Afterwards, people commented on my courage. (Alas, no one mentioned my singing prowess, but I digress.) &ldquo;How on earth could you stand up there and sing your graduation speech?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;That took guts!&rdquo;</p><h3> But here&rsquo;s the thing: Sometimes I think I&rsquo;m the biggest chicken to ever walk the face of the earth.</h3><p> <br/> I can stare at an email endlessly, stomach flipping the entire time, as I contemplate whether or not to click &ldquo;send.&rdquo; I can create public speaking scenarios far worse than simply tripping onstage. You think political debates seem endless? You should hear the ones I have in my head sometimes!</p><p> I remember being told we must be fearless if we are to live to our full potential. I heard it. I admired as I perceived it in others. Yet I&rsquo;d still feel my cheeks heating up and my heart racing when I encountered a new or uncertain situation.</p><p> Then, like a gift, I read Dr. Susan Jeffers&rsquo; classic, Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway. I learned that everyone feels fear, and that we don&rsquo;t need to fight or ignore our fear but rather learn to move forward with it. Just as the title suggests, we need to know how to acknowledge our fear and still take action.</p><p> This book prompted a turning point for me, and became one of the first books I had the  <u>  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/ASPIRESuccessClub.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ASPIRE Success Club  </a> </u>  read, too. Years later, we still bring up concepts we learned from this powerful resource. A few takeaways:</p><li> <strong>  Embrace your inner Pollyanna. </strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s reported that over 90% of what we worry about never happens,&rdquo; Jeffers wrote. &ldquo;That means our negative worries have about a 10% chance of being correct. If this is so, isn&rsquo;t it possible that being positive is more realistic than being negative?&rdquo; In brief: Think positive!</li><li> <strong>  Take responsibility. </strong> Staying in victim mode or living in blame serves no useful purpose. Of Susan&rsquo;s seven definitions of taking responsibility, the one that resonated most with me: &ldquo;Taking responsibility means figuring out what you want in life and acting on it. Set your goals &ndash; then go out and work toward them.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Action is the key to success &ndash; and the antidote to fear. </strong> I once had a client who understandably worried about her husband deployed in a war-torn country. She realized that while her worry did nothing, she could do a lot. She organized a group that made care packages, she got involved politically, and much more. Taking action changed her entire demeanor and outlook. <br/>  </li><p> ​Leadership can incite all kinds of fear &ndash; so much so that many shy away from a leadership role altogether. Whether you fear uncertainty, rejection, messing up, or the 80,000 other potential concerns that appear in any given situation, try this:</p><h3> Check in with your values. Decide what&rsquo;s best for the greater good. If you&rsquo;re singing your high school graduation speech, perhaps consider voice coaching.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Then, feel the fear&hellip;and do it anyway. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Last week the Federal Reserve announced it would delay the interest rate liftoff yet again, but while everyone seems concerned about nominal rates&mdash;the federal funds rate, in this case&mdash;real rates have already risen about 5 percent since August 2011. This &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; rate hike is much more impactful to commodity prices and emerging markets than a nominal rate hike, which is simply the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg.&rdquo;Since July 2014, the U.S. dollar has appreciated more than 20 percent. This has had huge implications for net commodity exporter countries, both developing and emerging, which typically see their currency rates fluctuate when prices turn volatile.But why does this happen?The main reason is that most commodities, including crude oil, metals and grains, are priced in U.S. dollars. They therefore share an inverse relationship. When the dollar weakens, prices tend to rise. And when it strengthens, prices fall, among other past ramifications, as you can see in the chart below courtesy of investment research firm Cornerstone Macro. <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Dollar-Appreciation-Spikes-Almost-Always-Lead-to-International-Crises-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Dollar-Appreciation Spikes Almost Always Lead to International Currency Crises\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Dollar-Appreciation-Spikes-Almost-Always-Lead-to-International-Crises-10302015.png\"/> </a> Indeed, commodities have collectively depreciated close to 40 percent since this time a year ago and are at their lowest point since March 2009. We might very well have reached an inflection point for commodities, which opens up investment opportunities.</p><h3> Net Commodity Exporters under Pressure</h3>The number of developing and emerging markets that are dependent on commodity exports has risen in recent years, from 88 five years ago to 94 today, according to the <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/suc2014d7_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) </u> .</a> Many of these countries&mdash;located mostly in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia&mdash;have a dangerously high dependency on a small number of not only commodity exports but also trading partners.For many suppliers, China is the leading buyer. But the Asian giant&rsquo;s imports have been slowing as its economy transitions from <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinae28099s-economy-is-undergoing-a-huge-transformation-that-no-onee28099s-talking-about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  manufacturing to services and housing </u> ,</a> forcing many net commodity export countries to rethink their dependency on China.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/CHN-Chinas-Services-Industry-Surpasses-50-Percent-GDP-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"China's Services Industry Surpasses 50 Percent GDP\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/CHN-Chinas-Services-Industry-Surpasses-50-Percent-GDP-10302015.png\"/></a>This is the position Indonesia finds itself in right now. As much as 50 percent of its total exports consists of crude oil, palm oil, copper, coal and rubber, all of which China has historically been a vital importer. A stunning 95 percent of Mongolia&rsquo;s exports flow into its southern neighbor, according to the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ryG8DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=cia.gov++/the-world-factbook/fields/2050&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YCqeL6Jv3B&amp;sig=ACfU3U3X-xoc-b8TSjr6B9VN_dVgmcMlZw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjE6_rh_t3gAhWdyosBHdh5BmgQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cia.gov%20%20%2Fthe-world-factbook%2Ffields%2F2050&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  World Factbook </u> .</a> And for Chile, commodities represent close to 90 percent of total exports, about 25 percent of which goes to China.But countries needn&rsquo;t have such a high dependency on commodities for their currencies to be affected. The Australian dollar, for instance, has a positive correlation with iron ore prices.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Australian-Dollar-Tracks-Iron-Ore-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Australian Dollar Tracks Iron Ore Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Australian-Dollar-Tracks-Iron-Ore-Prices-10302015.png\"/></a>About 98 percent of the world&rsquo;s iron ore supply is used to make steel. So important is the metal to the state of Western Australia, where most of the continent&rsquo;s deposits can be found, that every $1 decline in prices results in an <u> estimated $49 million budget loss</u>.The same relationship exists between the Peruvian sol and copper. Peru is the <u> fourth-largest copper producer in the world</u>, preceded by Chile, China and the U.S.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Peruvian-Sol-Tracks-Copper-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"The Peruvian Sol Tracks Copper Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Peruvian-Sol-Tracks-Copper-10302015.png\"/></a>The Russian ruble, Canadian dollar and Colombian peso all follow crude oil prices. (Russia is the third-largest oil producer in the world; Canada, the fifth-largest; Colombia, the 19th-largest.)<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Russian-Ruble-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Russian Ruble Tracks Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Russian-Ruble-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015.png\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Canadian-Dollar-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Canadian Dollar Tracks Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Canadian-Dollar-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015.png\"/></a><a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Colombian-Peso-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Colombian Peso tracks Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Colombian-Peso-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015.png\"/></a>It&rsquo;s important that we see stability in emerging market currencies, which would help support resources demand.

Morgan Global Purchasing Manager&rsquo;s Index (PMI). This indicator has steadily been trending lower. Although the reading is still above the neutral 50.0 line, commodity prices have reacted negatively.<a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Commodities-are-Highly-Correlated-to-Global-PMIs-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Commodities are Highly Correlated to Global PMIs\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Commodities-are-Highly-Correlated-to-Global-PMIs-10302015.png\"/></a>Cornerstone Macro believes both <u> <a href=\"http://cornerstonemacro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20151014_STR_RealTimeGlobalPMI1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the Chinese and global PMI are &ldquo;likely&rdquo; to rise </a></u> in October, leading to a full year of upside potential. If true, this is indeed welcome news, but it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the PMI looks ahead six months, meaning it&rsquo;ll take approximately that long for commodities to recover.In any case, now might be a good time for investors to consider getting back into commodities and natural resources since we could be in the early innings of an upturn.&ldquo;You want to buy commodity stocks when they&rsquo;re out of favor, because they are cyclical,&rdquo; Brian Hicks, portfolio manager of our <u> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/our-funds/our-mutual-funds/global-resources-fund/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Global Resources Fund (PSPFX) </a></u>, told <u> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/in-the-news/when-investing-in-resources-patience-is-key/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Energy Report </a></u> last week. &ldquo;If you look out 12, 18, 24 months from now, those equity values should reflect equilibrium commodity prices and move significantly higher from here.&rdquo;",

    "content": "<p> Written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TC_Talks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   TIAA-CREF  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   TIAA CREF Financial Servces  </u> </a></p><p> Even if you are an expert in your field, you may not feel so knowledgeable when it comes to investing your money. The good news is that you can avoid many common investment mistakes if you know to watch out for them. To do that, you may need more information, a professional opinion from a financial advisor&mdash;or simply to become more aware about how your emotions may be taking charge of your finances.</p><h3> Avoid these common investing mistakes:</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. Market timing </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you constantly choose investments based on yesterday&rsquo;s top performer, or abruptly sell investments based on the daily news, you may end up hurting your investment returns. Many studies&mdash;including a 2014 report from financial research firm DALBAR, Inc.&mdash;have found that individuals who buy and sell stocks on their own often generate lower returns than if they had just purchased and held a Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index Fund. Dalbar cites investor tendency to sell when markets fall and buy when markets rise again, underscoring the need to stick with a consistent investment strategy. So make a long-term investment plan and stay the course.1</p><h3> How to avoid making investment mistakes: <br/>  </h3><li> Develop a financial plan to help you reach your goals</li><li> Don&rsquo;t let fear, greed or other emotions take you off your plan</li><li> Be aware of the tax consequences of your investments</li><li> Decide in advance when you will sell an investment</li><li> Don&rsquo;t overreact to rising interest rates</li><li> Seek the help of a trusted financial advisor <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  2. Emotional decisions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Financial markets generally rise and fall without warning, soaring one day and dropping the next. If this volatility makes you nervous enough to change investment choices often &mdash;or move too much money into safer positions&mdash;you could end up managing your money too conservatively. The risk: Your savings may not have the opportunity to grow to the amount needed to cover your retirement or other long-term costs. Watch out, too, for overly optimistic emotions that can make you buy or stick with investments that did well for you in the past, even if they&rsquo;re underperforming today. Don&rsquo;t let fear or greed overtake your focus on the bigger picture.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Ignoring tax consequences </strong></h3><br/>Taxes can take a big bite out of your investments&mdash;both now and during retirement. While you are working and saving, be aware of your tax bracket and how tax consequences impact your total return in each account. If you have many years until you need to access your money, try to make sure that high dividend paying stock funds, bond funds, and funds that generate significant capital gains are held in a Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or employer-sponsored retirement accounts that can shelter gains from taxation.<br/> In accounts where your earnings will be taxed, such as a brokerage account, consider investing in mutual funds with low asset turnover, as well as mutual funds, ETFs, and stocks that pay smaller dividends. If you are in a higher tax bracket, check with your advisor to see if investing in municipal bonds or municipal bond funds makes more sense than taxable bonds.<p> Taxes matter when you are retired as well. For instance, you will not pay taxes on the returns generated within a workplace retirement plan such as a 403(b) or 401(k) during your working years. However, you&rsquo;ll need to plan for paying taxes on those savings when you withdraw money in retirement. An advisor can help you craft an income plan in retirement that takes your possible tax bill into account.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Holding losers too long </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s human nature to avoid the discomfort of facing a mistake&mdash;such as having invested in a stock, bond, or mutual fund that is losing value. Instead of biting the bullet and selling the investment at a loss, you may hold on&mdash;hoping the investment will rebound or at least get back to the price at which you bought it. A better strategy: Decide in advance the point at which you&rsquo;ll sell an investment if it drops in value. Also, ask yourself why you made the investment: Was it because it was rising in value? Recommended in the press? Or were you trying to diversify your portfolio? Understanding your rationale behind investment decisions can help you avoid similar mistakes in the future and solidify your decision to sell.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Overreacting to rising interest rates </strong></h3><p> <br/> Interest rates have been at historic lows since 2008, when the Federal Reserve&mdash;which sets short-term interest rates&mdash;pushed down the cost of borrowing to spark economic growth after the Great Recession. With the economy growing, the Fed is likely to push short-term interest rates higher. That could cause short-term stock market volatility and depress bond prices, as rising interest rates tend to push bond prices lower.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important not to overreact to any market volatility. If you have a long-term financial plan in place with your assets diversified broadly across stocks, bonds and real estate, you are likely to be well-positioned as interest rates rise. To learn more, read <a href=\"https://www.tiaa-cref.org/public/advice-guidance/education/investing/rising-interest-rates-and-investments?p=1331943740203\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Rising interest rates and your investments </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  6. Flying solo </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can handle many tasks on your own &mdash; from home repairs to lawn maintenance. However, financial planning probably shouldn&rsquo;t be one of them. A financial advisor can help you assess whether you&rsquo;re on track to meet financial goals, and identify investment options that fit your circumstances. A financial advisor can help make sure your asset allocation among stocks, fixed-income and other investment types is right for you. He or she can also help you regularly rebalance your allocation so it keeps up with market changes and your needs.</p><p> Fortunately, financial advice may be available through your workplace plan. Choose an advisor who offers advice that&rsquo;s personalized to your situation and risk tolerance. Ask your advisor how she is compensated &mdash; which generally includes commission-based, fee-only or a mixture of fee-and-commission based.</p><p> Investment help can come in forms other than a face-to-face advisor meeting. Help can also come through online webinars and investment products. For example, if you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable handling your own assets, a managed account can help. With a managed account, investment professionals create and monitor your portfolio day in and day out on your behalf, taking into account your stage of life, your risk tolerance and personal preferences such as whether you&rsquo;d like to invest in socially responsible funds or companies. Managed accounts free you from the pressure of making complex investment decisions on your own. There is usually a fee for managed account services.</p>1<a href=\"http://www.dalbar.com/Portals/dalbar/cache/News/PressReleases/2014QAIBHighlightsPR.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Dalbar annual Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior (PDF), 2014 edition </u> .</a>In the Dalbar study, individuals who have invested in stock funds have earned 5.02% annually over the past 20 years, versus a 9.22% annual return for the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index fund.

    "content": "<p> Here&rsquo;s a hot tip for your pitch deck: try to make it fail before sending it to a single investor.</p><p> The reason? Investors are a finicky bunch. They like to reject pitches quickly and send hopeful entrepreneurs on their merry way.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re jerks (or not usually). It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re busy.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/fred-wilson-interview-2014-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Seasoned investors  </a> </u>  get a lot more pitches than they could ever handle. As a result, they don&rsquo;t spend more than a  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/lessons-from-a-study-of-perfect-pitch-decks-vcs-spend-an-average-of-3-minutes-44-seconds-on-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   few minutes  </a> </u>  studying pitch decks, even for the companies they end up funding.</p><p> The job of your pitch deck is to get a  <strong>  fair hearing </strong>  for your startup. You want investors to read the whole thing. That&rsquo;s all. If your deck accomplishes that much, you&rsquo;re halfway to Vegas.</p><p> In order to get a fair hearing, you wanna account for all the obvious and subtle ways in which typical pitch decks fail. That means  <u>  critiquing your deck </u>  like an investor. For example, since brevity in pitch decks is important, you could remove a slide to test whether the remaining slides make sense. If the whole deck unravels like a ball of yarn, then you know that slide is a keeper. If the deck holds up, you drop the slide.</p><p> Of course, investors don&rsquo;t operate by pure logic and rational thinking. The truth is, every venture capitalist and angel investor has passed on a company that he or she later regretted. All because of something they couldn&rsquo;t see. The oversight usually comes down to one of these reasons:</p><h3> Market <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  No interest in market. </strong>  Most investment firms and angels stick to particular markets. Check what markets they invest in before contacting them.</li><li> <strong>  No expertise in market. </strong>  It&rsquo;s too risky for investors to fund companies in markets they don&rsquo;t understand. Instead, they limit themselves to markets in which they have experience.</li><li> <strong>  Addressable market is hazy. </strong>  The total addressable market (TAM) should be a quick metric to locate. If the investor disagrees with your calculation of market demand, he or she may stop reading on the spot.</li><li> <strong>  Market already covered. </strong> Investors usually balance their portfolio so that one sector or market never becomes too important.</li><li> <strong>  Market is capped out. </strong>  This may be related to TAM,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.caycon.com/blog/2013/10/understanding-market-size-or-demystifying-tam-sam-and-som/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SAM  </a> </u>  (Service Available Market) or SOM (Service Obtainable Market).</li><li> <strong>  Sick of your market. </strong>  It&rsquo;s them, not you&hellip; really.</li><li> <strong>  Tech bubble. </strong>  It&rsquo;s very hard to get around this objection without doing a deep dive into  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/mark-cuban-we-re-in-a-tech-bubble-and-it-s-worse-than-2000\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   economics  </a> </u> . One clue about their feelings might be if their investments have been declining year over year.</li><li> <strong>  Too late.  </strong> Investors may sense a changing of the tide, new technology or user habits that make your product obsolete.</li><li> <strong>  Too early. </strong>  Investors think the necessary supporting infrastructure for your product (e.g., 100% self-driving cars in 2016) isn&rsquo;t available.</li><li> <strong>  Opportunity isn&rsquo;t big. </strong>  Your product might become the #1 in a  <u>  deeply fragmented market </u>  (e.g., Underwater Pyromaniacs&rdquo;), but not big enough to convert the masses. <br/>  </li><h3> Product <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  No MVP. </strong>  Investors will say no if you haven&rsquo;t built, tested, and learned from at least one  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfQmfEJWt3M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   minimum viable product  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  No obvious unfair advantage.  </strong> Investors are skeptical of any company they think is missing an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Unfair-Advantage-Maximum/dp/0743256050\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unfair advantage  </a> </u> . It means vulnerability, which is a revenue killer.</li><li> <strong>  No revenue stream. </strong>  Investors are leery of products that have yet to attract paying customers. They know most free users will never convert to paying customers.</li><li> <strong>  No traction.  </strong> Investors often have VERY different definitions of traction than startup founders founders. If you can&rsquo;t demonstrate traction, they won&rsquo;t be convinced that their money will solve for the problem.</li><li> <strong>  No social proof. </strong>  Social proof is a key component for swaying investors to take the next step. Your pitch deck should include some combination of glowing testimonials, massive social shares or virality.</li><li> <strong>  No proof of concept. </strong>  Some investors want to see documented studies to back up your product&rsquo;s claims.</li><li> <strong>  No patents. </strong>  Patents are one way investors protect their money. If your product is truly unique, a missing patent raises a giant red flag.</li><li> <strong>  Non-defensible technology. </strong>  Investors like the companies they back to have enough of a technological head start, that rivals and upstarts won&rsquo;t be able to duplicate them.</li><li> <strong>  Oversimplification.  </strong> While investors like simplicity in a product, they don&rsquo;t like it TOO simple. That&rsquo;s to say, it should probably look simpler than it really is, otherwise anybody can come along and disrupt you.</li><li> <strong>  Bad targeting.  </strong> Your product hasn&rsquo;t distinguished itself sufficiently in a crowded market. <br/>  </li><h3> Pitch Deck <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Too wordy. </strong>  The dense copy in your deck may signal to investors an overly complex product or an inability on your part to isolate the big problem.</li><li> <strong>  Too long. </strong>  Your pitch deck should be as short as possible, but as long as necessary to make your best case. Remember, the lizard brain&rsquo;s attention span is about 8 seconds.</li><li> <strong>  All hype. </strong>  Investors have sharp BS detectors and nothing soils a pitch deck like Barnum n&rsquo; Bailyesque shouting.</li><li> <strong>  Boring first slide. </strong>  Start your pitch deck with a bang, so they want to see the second slide.</li><li> <strong>  Deck drags. </strong>  Your pitch deck is not a novel, with an introduction or extended back story. Say what you have to  <u>  <a href=\"http://pitchdeckcoach.com/pitch-deck#elevator-pitch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   say quickly  </a> </u> ; cut right to the chase.</li><li> <strong>  Vanity metrics galore. </strong>   <u>  <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/social-authority\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vanity metrics  </a> </u>  have no place in pitch deck. Investors can spot them easily and will think you&rsquo;re a rube for including them.</li><li> <strong>  Plain ol&rsquo; ugly.  </strong> Ugly design is a turnoff to investors; it hurts attention spans and comes across as mildly insulting &mdash; as if you didn&rsquo;t think enough of them to pretty it up.</li><li> <strong>  Zero charts, graphs, diagrams and pictures. </strong>  Investors think hard all day; they don&rsquo;t wanna expend brain cells on reading if they can get by using visuals.</li><li> <strong>  Missing appendix. </strong> Investors want to look deeper into companies they&rsquo;re interested in. Give them that opportunity early, by including an appendix.</li><li> <strong>  No story arc.  </strong> A pitch deck that tells a story by tracing your journey, is more likely to pull investors in.  <u>  Stories </u>  get investors emotionally committed to startups.</li><li> <strong>  No unifying thread. </strong>  A pitch deck has to work as a whole package. Jarring, disparate slides are confusing and make investors question your vision.</li><li> <strong>  Ripoff idea.  </strong> Investors are not interested in &ldquo;me too&rdquo; offerings. Your pitch deck has to be different from other ideas by at least 25%.</li><li> <strong>  Product described as &ldquo;X for Y.&rdquo;  </strong> This description still works but it&rsquo;s overused. A lot of investors have heard this so many times that they assume the presenter is full of it.</li><li> <strong>  CTA is missing. </strong>  Not a huge problem, but investors expect you to come right out and ask for the money. Never play coy or forget to include a call to action at the end of a presentation.</li><li> <strong>  No teaching moment. </strong>  Investors are life-long students. At minimum, your pitch deck should teach them something they didn&rsquo;t know as a reward for reading it.</li><li> <strong>  Awkward analogies.  </strong> Analogies are supposed to make ideas easy to understand. The problem is that they&rsquo;re subjective, and open to debate/arguments.</li><li> <strong>  One long analogy. </strong>  Analogies should be used in certain places to  <u>  <a href=\"http://reidhoffman.org/linkedin-pitch-to-greylock/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   drive home a point  </a> </u> . Investors will think you&rsquo;re living in a hypothetical fantasy world if you extend the analogy too far.</li><li> <strong>  See no risks. </strong>  All products carry risk and it&rsquo;s your job to honestly identify them. Investors will notice if you leave them out of your pitch deck. </li><li> <strong>  Competitors are MIA. </strong>  Like risks, all products face competition. Investors will think you&rsquo;re blind or sleazy if you don&rsquo;t include them in your pitch deck.</li><li> <strong>  No solution for risks. </strong>  Investors know how hard it is to build a successful company. They want to see some indication that you have the tenacity and drive to overcome hurdles.</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Reason Why&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t compelling. </strong>  Your mission statement (&ldquo;why this matters&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t excite investors, or tap into a larger trend (&ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://opensource.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Open Source  </a> </u>  freedom!&rdquo; ).</li><li> <strong>  Problem isn&rsquo;t painful. </strong>  The problem you&rsquo;re solving for isn&rsquo;t in the Top 3 issues for your users, making it easy for them to ignore your solution.</li><li> <strong>  Flawed go-to-market strategy.  </strong> Investors see fundamental problems in your distribution plan (e.g., mail order ice cream).</li><li> <strong>  Unrealistic valuation. </strong>  Maybe you&rsquo;ve raised money before. Your valuation should represent the added value, with demonstrated facts.</li><li> <strong>  Too vague about money plans. </strong>  Your pitch deck should make it absolutely clear where the new money will go (e.g., hiring 6 full-time engineers, office space in SoMa). <br/>  </li><h3> Founder/Team <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t like you. </strong>  If you offend them in any way (e.g., joking about green technology), they may pass before even considering your deck. Read up on all the people you&rsquo;ll be presenting to.</li><li> <strong>  Founder&rsquo;s paycheck. </strong>  Investors aren&rsquo;t keen on founders who pay themselves above and beyond the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; rate. Point blank: they don&rsquo;t want to  <u>  <a href=\"http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/investors-run-background-checks-on-startup-founders/48399908\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fund your lifestyle  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  No reputation. </strong>  It&rsquo;s easier for investors to say no to a stranger than it is to an acquaintance or friend.</li><li> <strong>  Bad reputation. </strong> Investors may not even open your email if you&rsquo;ve burned a few bridges. If your reputation stinks, start repairing it now.</li><li> <strong>  Technology team is weak. </strong>  Good coders are  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/08/30/will-i-am-stem-mars/#9vVI2jYZvsqK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   rock stars  </a> </u> . If your tech team doesn&rsquo;t have an impressive resume, investors will probably think you&rsquo;ll have trouble attracting top talent.</li><li> <strong>  Think you&rsquo;re unteachable. </strong>  This is particularly important for investors who  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/533/its-not-the-product-its-the-person\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   actively advise  </a> </u>  the companies they fund.</li><li> <strong>  Help wanted. </strong>  It&rsquo;s always harder to get funding if you still have key positions to fill.</li><li> <strong>  Key people not on your team.  </strong> Investors are leery of founders without  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3032548/hit-the-ground-running/the-only-6-people-you-need-on-your-founding-startup-team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   technological expertise  </a> </u>  or deep sales experience.</li><li> <strong>  Team lacks experience. </strong>  Startups face all sorts of hazards, that can&rsquo;t be predicted. Veteran founders can at least draw from their experience.

    "content": "<h3> Over the last few years I&rsquo;ve been really interested in the term &ldquo;Authenticity.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Partly because it is thrown around so much and sounds pretty pretentious. And partly because I spent so much of my life consciously and unconsciously trying to define myself in a singular, unified way.  I thought living authentically meant  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/blog/stop-labeling-yourself-do-this-instead\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  figuring out the one label that best described me </a>  and then tailoring all my choices and actions into that one type.</p><p> It&rsquo;s kind of like the stereotypical high school archetypes: the jocks, the nerds, the drama geeks, etc. When we associate with a distinct identity or group, we feel certain and safe. We know what to say and how to act. The problem is that human beings aren&rsquo;t that simple. We&rsquo;re complex, ever-changing, and inconsistent. As we develop more mature ways of thinking about ourselves, we feel conflicted: We acknowledge growth, yet still want a unified and consistent identify that we can hang our hat on at any given moment. It does't matter if we label ourselves in a positive or negative light, a single identity creates stagnation.</p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s the Giver, the Achiever, or the Judgmental Bitch, we all have different sides that combine to create a constantly changing identity. And that&rsquo;s the rub: Living authentically means accepting that you will never have a fixed, unchanging label. It means that you understand the dynamics of the constantly shifting ecosystem inside you.</p><h3> <strong>  Time For A Diagram: </strong></h3><img alt=\"An abbreviated sample of my parts. Feel free to judge.\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51a73312e4b0434836e3394d/t/563a1437e4b0be7e57b82dee/1446646840813/Parts.png?format=1000w\"/><p> <br/> AN ABBREVIATED SAMPLE OF MY PARTS. FEEL FREE TO JUDGE.</p><p> In an ideal world, you&rsquo;d be the perfectly balanced itsy-bitsy part in the middle. Nothing in life would rattle you or move you from that position (and you&rsquo;d be the most boring person I know!) In reality, there are triggers that move you closer to a specific combination of your parts. Or, in an extreme situation, mostly one part. Ultimately, your goal is to recognize the parts of you that overlap and actively tap into each of them, inching closer toward the center.</p><h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s How: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Accept that at any given moment, you are a combination of each part of you.</li><li> Listen to all the voices in your head. As crazy as that may sound, they are there for a reason.  </li><li> Dial up and dial down each part as needed. None of your parts are good or bad, it&rsquo;s what you make of them. There are moments when what serves me best is to nurture others, and moments when that prevents me from prioritizing myself.</li><li> Honor each part and avoid judgment. Sometimes a part that we&rsquo;ve labeled as a weakness is a strength that&rsquo;s dialed up too high.</li><li> Be authentic. Whether that means taking deliberate action or choosing to disengage. This applies to your words, too: Say what you mean and mean what you say. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Takeaway:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Authenticity comes from tapping into all your parts without judgment and acting from a place of acceptance and truth.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Today&rsquo;s knowledge-hungry consumers often know as much about a product as the people trying to sell it. So what&rsquo;s your sales edge? Learning to build stronger relationships with your clients.</h3><p> <br/> I was reading some great information recently on social selling and how social media has changed the sales process. The power now is in the hands of socially savvy buyers who come to the table armed with as much&mdash;or even more&mdash;information than the sales professional. These days, the consumer&rsquo;s sales journey can be 90 percent complete before they even think about interacting with a salesperson.</p><p> So what&rsquo;s a traditionally trained sales professional to do?</p><p> Research has shown that sales professionals who use social media to network and build relationships outsell their peers who don&rsquo;t. And let&rsquo;s face it: Sales is all about building relationships.</p><h3> <strong>  Integrity-Based Relationship Building </strong></h3><p> <br/> But how exactly do they do it? Kevin Thomas Tully, a sales professional and a principal of Toronto-based social selling training company  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salesforlife.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sales for Life  </a> </u> , credits the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salesforlife.com/s4lsocial/how-to-sell-on-social-media/?origin=meddle.it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   three Cs of social selling  </a> </u> &mdash;content, conversation and conversion&mdash;as </p><p> pillars of the sales process, and he&rsquo;s right. But he also notes that the linchpin to the whole engine is the ability to build integrity-based relationships. And that istruly the key.</p><p> Building integrity-based relationships means making a human connection without trying to sell and nurturing your connections from a human fellowship perspective, not a sales or brand-side perspective. From initial connection through conversation and even conversion, when you forge relationships the right way, better sales results come naturally.</p><p> When it comes to relationship building,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.callieschweitzer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Callie Schweitzer  </a> </u> , editorial director of audience strategy for Time magazine and Time Inc. and one of Business Insider&rsquo;s &ldquo;30 Most Important Women in Tech Under 30&rdquo; in 2013, stresses the power of being genuine in your networking efforts, being well read on industry&rsquo;s trends (for sharing purposes) and following up. Schweitzer uses social as a never-ending feedback loop to constantly learn and interact with people. Again, her methods are integrity-based, and while she&rsquo;s not directly involved in sales, the same skills apply.</p><p> In short, anyone can benefit from honing their human skills to build good relationships. The trick is to:</p><li> Listen.</li><li> Be genuine.</li><li> Get excited about finding solutions for people.</li><li> Be proactive in both reaching out and following up. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Trust and Your Reputation </strong></h3><p> <br/> And these tips aren&rsquo;t just for salespeople&mdash;they&rsquo;re for business leaders, too. After all, your business revolves around connecting with people and forging strong, productive, one-on-one relationships.</p><p> It all comes down to trust. The trust that others put in you goes beyond any form of measurement. Trust is closely tied to integrity, and brings with it boundless opportunities and possibilities, and it&rsquo;s contagious! Every person who trusts you will spread the word of that trust to at least a few others. And remember: A brand is what a business does, but a reputation is what people remember and share.</p><p> So instead of thinking in terms of quotas, sales figures and bottom line when you&rsquo;re talking to people, think in terms of how you can weave integrity into how you connect and converse with them. Think about how you can add value to their lives at every touch point. Trust me, the conversion will take care of itself.</p><p> This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ted Rubin  </u> </a></p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Susan Marshall</p><h3> The rise of digital tech and marketing has altered the way business is done around the globe &ndash; in almost every possible way. These advances, which are happening faster and faster, can leave businesses and entire industries behind if nothing is changed. And for the financial industry, that&rsquo;s exactly what has happened. The companies that are quick to adopt proven digital tech and engage with their customers in the way they want to be engaged with, will thrive, while others quickly fade.</h3><p> <br/> According to a recent ebook published by Marketo entitled, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.marketo.com/_assets/uploads/Dont-Get-Left-Behind-The-Rise-of-Digital-Marketing-in-Financial-Services.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Don&rsquo;t Get Left Behind: The Rise of Digital Marketing in Financial Services </a> &rdquo;, &ldquo;Financial institutions have traditionally been slow to change, mostly due to the existing perspectives of how things should be done and the long time-scales required for their operations. This makes them rather conservative and unwilling to experiment with new and possibly unsafe technologies. In fact, a recent survey of more than 3,000 banks put out by Wipro Technologies found that fewer than 15% of banks have mature digital marketing policies. This is clearly much lower than other industries.&rdquo;</p><p> Below, we&rsquo;ll explore 5 dynamic financial marketers who are leading the charge in advancing digital tech across their companies:</p><h3> Leila Lavaee, Data Analytics Lead, Digital Strategy &amp; Customer Experience, TD Bank ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TDBank_US\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @TDBank_US  </u> </a> )</h3><p> <br/> Leila recently gave a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/08/big-data-innovation-summit-2014-toronto-day1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   thought-provoking talk  </a> </u>  on &ldquo;&lsquo;Big Data&rsquo; Mindset and How it Can Enhance Customer Experience&rdquo;. &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; seems to be a no-brainer and so many more organizations are trying to run big data projects. But last year the focus was more on infrastructure and all costs associated with it. What seems to be missing in the bigger picture is the true value of big data which is if and only if it drives strategic insights. Based on Gartner; 64% of enterprises surveyed indicated they&rsquo;re deploying or planning big data. Yet, they still don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Leila explained how to develop &ldquo;big data&rdquo; mindset in an organization and how to use it for enhancing customer experience.</p><p> She suggested that instead of &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; we should rather think about &ldquo;Right Data&rdquo;. Storing vast amounts of data in an extremely efficient manner does not benefit an enterprise if it isn&rsquo;t using that data to generate insights that drive marketing and business decisions. People have a narrow vision of Big Data, thinking of the term merely in the context of IT infrastructure, storage, cost, training, privacy, security, etc. Big Data is a shift in strategy, and not merely a technology.</p><h3> Alex Sion, CEO &ndash; Movenbank ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asion1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @asion1  </u> </a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getMoven\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @getMoven  </u> </a> )</h3><p> <br/> In a  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getMoven\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent interview  </a> </u> , Alex shared that he believes banking is going to be less about product innovation and more about innovation on the client experience. According to Alex, banking has to get back to the place where the banking experience is utility for the customer rather than profit and benefit for the bank. The top 3 decisions he believes marketers should consider are:</p><p> Who is my customer?</p><p> What is the value I&rsquo;m providing them?</p><p> How do I best represent and talk about the value in the marketplace?</p><p> He believes financial marketers need to look closely at those questions and anticipates there will be a lot of reconsideration of what the banking experience actually should be.</p><p> According to Alex, banking is a digital offer and it surprises him that a product which is entirely virtual is so dependent on marketing and distribution, &ldquo;which is a bad problem&rdquo;. He believes the retail banking industry is at a key turning point. The cost of managing customers through massive branch networks is outstripping many banks&rsquo; ability to generate profits. Meanwhile, a jaded consumer base increasingly interacts with their banks through virtual channels. Ultimately, these two forces will lead to new distribution models, customer experience platforms, crowdsourced business models and other game-changing innovations that will redefine the banking industry.</p><h3> Melissa Musgrove, VP, Head of Social Media &ndash; Regions Financial Bank ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMMusgrove\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @MMMusgrove  </u> </a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/askRegions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @askRegions  </u> </a> )</h3><p> <br/> Melissa, who runs social media at Regions Financial Bank,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialdigitalmarketingus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DMFS_US_ebook_41.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recently commented  </a> </u>  &ldquo;Consumers are making purchasing decisions in an increasingly crowded market.&rdquo; In Financial Services, disruptive technologies in alternative payment systems, virtual currencies and crowdlending/funding are requiring companies to innovate or lose market share. Melissa believes Mobile is the future of Digital as marketers learn to use it to develop relationships across a consumer&rsquo;s lifecycle. Programmatic buying, native advertising and personalization continue to drive innovation. It&rsquo;s driving engagement where our customers are, not where we want them to be.</p><h3> Keith Gormley, Director, Social Media &ndash; Prudential ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeithGormley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @KeithGormley  </u> </a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PrudentialBYC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @PrudentialBYC  </u> </a> )</h3><p> <br/> Prudential, which recently launch &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93441rJhREY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bring Your Challenges Campaign  </a> </u> &rdquo; via social, has found great success in connecting with customers and potential customers online.  <u>  Keith recommends </u>  first, rather than using social media as a channel to simply broadcast messages, find a way to engage your audience in two-way conversation to harness the true value of the medium. Listen to your audience &ndash; if you give them the opportunity they&rsquo;ll provide wonderful insight that can help you do business better.</p><p> Second, Keith advises to prepare for the worst, but expect the best. For younger and savvier audiences, social media will be the first place they look to find your brand &ndash; in good times and in bad. That can work to your advantage, but it can work against you if you&rsquo;re not prepared. Set up a solid internal team to support the program, and include key stakeholders early.</p><h3> Laura Barger, Managing Director, Head of Corporate Content Marketing &ndash; BNY MELLON ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BNYMellon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   @BNYMellon  </u> </a> )</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I believe that the days of B2B marketing &ndash; in the traditional sense &ndash; are gone when it comes to digital strategy. At the end of the day, the consumer at the other end of the device is a person, and participates in the decision-making process in a critical way, no matter how senior their level is within an organization,&rdquo; said Laura Barger.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialdigitalmarketingus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DMFS_US_ebook_41.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to Laura  </a> </u> , it could be argued that this is old news for a number of other industries, but financial services is really starting to wake up to the opportunities afforded them through deep data analysis on digital channels, personalization, and automation. The most disruptive technologies in this space recognize the behavioral changes that need to happen for organizations to adopt these tactics and are steps ahead of their clients with their understanding of compliance and regulatory benchmarks. Laura believes that the technologies that are going to survive and make the most impact will be the ones that provide a truly open ecosystem so that brands can mix and match the services &ndash; analytics, content management, social listening, automation, personalization &ndash; to their needs and drive real-time data back to the businesses in ways that they can use.</p><p> We hope that you and your organization are inspired by the future of financial tech.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> As a financial advisor all of your prospecting efforts culminate in one final meeting. In this meeting you have the opportunity to present your solutions and motivate the prospect to become your client. When so much is at stake why do financial advisors spend so little time preparing for these appointments?</p><p> I worked with one of my advisors by helping her prep for a closing appointment.  After spending a full hour on this process I realized in their desire to close the business many advisors often overlook the critical steps that can ultimately tip the scales in their favor.</p><h3> The Appointment process can be broken down into 5 important steps:</h3><p> <br/> 1.     <strong>  Review your findings: </strong> While prepping for the presentations write out everything you have learned and then review these findings at the beginning of the appointment. Not only does this give you a chance to get positive affirmations from the prospect but both you and the prospect will feel more confident that you truly understand their needs and concerns.</p><p> 2.     <strong>  Share your concerns: </strong> Based on those findings now is your opportunity to express the challenges, risks and concerns you have with their current situation. Again it's important to get feedback from the client that they too understand these concerns before moving on.</p><p> 3.     <strong>  Present your solutions: </strong> NOW you can present your solutions and as you do constantly refer back to how these solutions address specific issues and concerns. It&rsquo;s your job to tie all the pieces of this presentation together.</p><p> 4.     <strong>  Get confirmation: </strong> This is a great time to ask open ended questions. Open ended questions put the onus on the prospect and will give you more insight as to possible objections.</p><li> What do you like about this strategy?</li><li> How do you see this strategy solving your issues and concerns?</li><li> What part of this strategy do you not <br/>  </li><p>  5.     <strong>  Ask for what you want: </strong> Before you begin the presentation be very clear on what you want, open the account, transfer all the assets in, get a commitment on a product or plan. Be clear as to what you want and know how you intend to ask for it. At this point it is important to ask closed ended questions, you now are looking for a yes/no answer. If you get a yes you are on your way, if you get a no go back to step 4 and ask more open ended questions such as:</p><li> What is preventing you from moving forward?</li><li> What is getting in the way of us doing business together?</li><li> What can I do to earn your business? <br/>  </li><p> In addition as you prep for your appointment, make a list of all the questions the prospect may ask, do some brainstorming beforehand and go to the meeting prepared to answer any of the questions on your list. By doing this prep work first you will go into the meeting with greater confidence and your clarity and conviction alone will enhance your ability to get a commitment and the business.</p>",

    "link": "mental-skills-every-business-leader-can-learn-from-athletes",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  When I went before the New Agents Review Board, my instructors expressed concern that I was not athletic enough to become an FBI agent. I stood a strong chance of being washed out of the FBI Academy. </strong></p><p> My first response was, &ldquo;How are 50 pushups going to help me be a better investigator?&rdquo; Agents don&rsquo;t use their physical muscles to puzzle their way through the facts of an investigation. Instead, they use their mental skills.</p><p> Only later was I able to recognize that while brawn would not make me a better agent, my athletic training was creating a set of mental skills that I would utilize throughout my 24 year FBI career.</p><p> As entrepreneurs and business owners, you will need these same mental skills to keep moving forward when you hit a roadblock or an unexpected obstacle stands in your way.</p><p> In a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25558960\" target=\"_blank\">   recent study of athletes  </a> </u>  who successfully completed sport injury rehabilitation, it was determined that the top 3 mental skills reported were Goal Setting, Positive Thinking, and Imagery.</p><p> I was not surprised by this list because these mental toughness tools can produce the right attitude to move everyone toward success. Here is a closer look at the mental skills every business leader can learn from athletes:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Goal Setting </strong></h3><p> <br/> Setting a goal is not only identifying something you want, but also something you are willing to persevere in order to achieve. </p><p> Setting a specific goal makes you more likely to achieve it, and that is especially important when you want to make a change in your career or business, or if you run into an obstacle on your journey toward that goal. </p><h3> Tip #1 Set Goals For The Right Reason</h3><p> <br/> Stop fantasizing about winning the lottery or making $10 million. Instead, set goals that align themselves to what really matters to your happiness and future well being.</p><h3> Tip #2 Set A Direction</h3><p> <br/> Set your life in a direction so that the pursuit of it will produce the life you want. If the journey is the right one, don&rsquo;t worry if goals change or evolve with time.</p><h3> Tip #3 Change The Goal If It&rsquo;s Not Taking You In The Right Direction</h3><p> <br/> Use mental skills to focus on the right thing&mdash;the direction you are moving. Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of getting married to your goal.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Positive Thinking </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is a big difference between being an optimist and being a positive thinker.</p><p> Positive thinkers are not necessarily happy or optimistic.</p><p> Instead, positive thinkers are blunt realists who look misery right in the eye and confront the most brutal facts of their day without expecting things to change. They adapt to their circumstances without ever losing hope.</p><p> Positive thinking is a mental skill that will help get you through any setback that comes your way.</p><h3> Tip #1 Find 5 Positive Thoughts To Counter Each Negative Thought</h3><p> <br/> The brain is naturally wired to pay more attention to negative rather than positive information because negative alerts us to emergencies and threats to our life.</p><p> When confronted with something that feels overwhelming, you will need to find 5 positive thoughts to counter each one negative thought that comes to mind. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find something positive in your situation and you have to look really hard.</p><h3> Tip # 2. Reflect On Each Positive Thought For 20 Seconds</h3><p> <br/> Take the time to really think about each positive thought. Let it soak in, don&rsquo;t gloss over it. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Brain-Practical-Neuroscience-Happiness-ebook/dp/B003TU29WU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444952234&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=buddhas+brain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Negative thoughts are like velcro; they stick  </a> </u> .</p><p> Positive thoughts are like teflon; they slide away easily.</p><h3> Tip #3 Stop Using The Word &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This is the only 4 letter word I never heard in the FBI.</p><p> Every time you say &ldquo;I CAN&rsquo;T&rdquo; you create a negative feedback loop in your brain that keeps getting stronger and stronger. Synaptic connections thicken the brain tissues over time, wiring in that negativity. </p><h3> <strong>  3. Imagery </strong></h3><p> <br/> The benefits of using imagery and visualization is an incredible tool to develop mental toughness. This mental skill is based on solid science. By visualizing your successful performance repeatedly, your brain stores that information as a success.</p><h3> Tip #1: Visualize Your Success</h3><p> <br/> When we give our brain a detailed portrait of our end goal, our brain releases dopamine,  <u>  a powerful mental toughness tool to steer us toward success </u> . This is the chemical that becomes active when we encounter situations that are linked to rewards from the past.</p><p> Dopamine enables us to feel good about our experiences and gives us confidence to move toward those rewards. To boost this brain response:</p><li> Imagine how events will unfold. </li><li> See yourself winning or achieving your goal. </li><li> Hear yourself being positive about the challenge before you. </li><li> Form a clear mental picture and do it several times a day. </li><li> Create a positive frame of mind. </li><li> Find images that represent your goal and post them where you&rsquo;ll see them regularly. <br/>  </li><p> If you don&rsquo;t see yourself as a winner, neither will anyone else.</p><h3> Tip #2: Differentiate Between Visioning and Fantasy</h3><p> <br/> Visualizing is not fantasy or wishful thinking. Fantasies can actually lessen your chance for success. Your brain can tell the difference, and looks at fantasies as a threat!</p><p> If people fantasize about their future, they are less prepared and more stressed when things don&rsquo;t workout they way they had hoped.</p><h3> Tip #3: Move Ahead With Fearlessness</h3><p> <br/> Use imagery and  <u>  visualize how you will succeed </u>  in various situations you might encounter in the future. For example:</p><li> Visualize how you will react and respond when criticized by a colleague</li><li> Predict your performance in the morning meeting</li><li> Be prepared for the hard questions that will come from your boss.</li><li> Rehearse your response to situations/conversations that might come up. <br/>  </li><p> This is enough to get that important shot of dopamine. It can help take you beyond your self-limiting beliefs about yourself and move you beyond your current circumstances.</p><p> Which one of these mental toughness tools have you used to keep moving forward?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Valery Satterwhite </u> | <a href=\"http://www.nailmystartup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Nail My Startup  </u> </a></p><p> \"Unlike a movie where an unexpected revelation or plot twist is half the fun, surprise endings for face-to-face marketing campaigns can be catastrophic.\"</p><p> Unless you live in a vacuum then your business will have competitors. There may be just a few, there may be many, but chances are you want to beat them. It&rsquo;s a dog eat dog world out there and you&rsquo;ve got to fight hard to survive, stay ahead of the game, keep your nose in front and every other business related clich&eacute; you can think of. In short, bouncing the competition off the walls is part of your business DNA.</p><p> The equation is simple:  Beat the competition = Get more customers = Achieve more success.</p><p> The trouble is, particularly in the world of business, nothing is quite that simple.</p><p> Competition actually encourages you to take your eye off the ball and spending too much time outwitting your rivals can simply be a waste of valuable time. Acme Solutions on the other side of town might be filching customers with a similar product to yours but that&rsquo;s not the issue. It&rsquo;s not even the problem.</p><p> The problem is that you&rsquo;ve forgotten to ask what your market actually wants.</p><h3> What is Competition?</h3><p> <br/> Who competes for your customers? If you run a restaurant then you might think it is the Chinese down the road or the MacDonald&rsquo;s at the local mall. Yes, they&rsquo;re in the same business as you, they&rsquo;re providing cooked food and the promise of a good time in much the same way as your humble little eatery.</p><p> But they&rsquo;re not the only competition. There are threats to your business everywhere.</p><p> There&rsquo;s the bar next door and the grocery store next to that to name just two.</p><p> Wait? A grocery store? Blue Apron Gourmet meals are a direct competition to your restaurant. Your customer, who was previously going to visit your restaurant spots a nice recipe in store and decides to stay in for their meal. That, my friend, is competition. That pre-cooked, ready wrapped gourmet meal is vying for a piece of your market.</p><p> Other competition can include supermarkets and corner stores. It can even include the local movie house &ndash; hey, hun, do you want to eat or go see that film tonight. Anything that diverts customers away from your restaurant is a competitor. Hell, even a sick kid when your customer is about to head out for a date is a competitor.</p><p> Competition is widespread and often nefarious. It is not always what you think it is. To your market it is any product or service that solves the same problem even if it&rsquo;s completely different type of solution.</p><h3> Competition is Good</h3><p> <br/> Yes. On the whole, competition is good. It creates choice, it helps you to improve your particular part of the pie and it leads to innovation. Without competitors you&rsquo;d have to come up with your own solutions rather than stealing theirs. These illusory people and corporations actually justify your existence &ndash; you&rsquo;re not the only person in the world who thinks this product is useful. Competition is good. Competition is GREAT!</p><p> Your competition can give you a proven roadmap to success. How?</p><p> Examine your top five successful competitors. Do a Google search on each of their names and look at the links to all the channel sales and visibility partners they've leveraged over the years to build awareness and drive revenue. Chances are many of these same channels are good opportunities for your business as well. Examine how and where they market themselves.</p><p> For example, it's one thing to know they are reaching their market through social networks such as Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram. It's another to study what, specifically, they are doing on those platforms to successfully engage with their audience. If your competitors have a newsletter, opt-in and have a look at how they reach out to their customers. Study how email marketing deepens their relationship and credibility within the target market.</p><h3> Staying Ahead by a Nose isn&rsquo;t Enough</h3><p> <br/> Many businesses fall into the trap of trying to stay ahead of the competition. The shop across the road offers a three for two deal so you go one better and start putting out a buy one get one free offer. They provide a complementary cup with their ground coffee, you decide you&rsquo;ve got to give away a cafetiere with each pack. The law firm next door decides to provide free consultations, you think it&rsquo;s an appropriate time to start running a legal surgery in your local park.</p><p> You spend so much time keeping up with the competition that you stop thinking about what your customer actually wants. You lose focus. And that&rsquo;s bad.</p><h3> Forget Sticking Plaster Solutions</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way straight away: Your competition is irrelevant.</p><p> If you are spending much of your time trying to stay small increments ahead of your nearest rival then you are a) going to be fighting for your business life every minute of every day, b) you are not going to succeed, and c) you a probably going to end up in an early grave.</p><p> Your market is important. Your market is the only thing that is important and you need to get away from this misconception that beating the competition makes your stronger. It doesn&rsquo;t. Beating the competition is akin to sticking a band aid on an axe wound.</p><h3> Digging Deep for the Whole Solution</h3><p> <br/> Your product or service will sell if you provide what your market wants. You provide a solution to their problem. That&rsquo;s why people buy stuff. That&rsquo;s why they want your product. Is it good enough? Could it be better? The answer to that lies in finding out the cost of the problem &ndash; whether that is financial, emotional or even physical &ndash; and then uncovering the solution. To do this, you need to drill deep into what your potential customers think. You need to go beyond the bland surveys that many market research organizations opt for without thinking.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say that your competitors have a sticking plaster solution to a recurring problem that your market has had to suffer for the last umpteen years. How do you think your market would like a more sustainable solution &ndash; one that actually works? What difference do you think it would make to their business?</p><p> Kicking away the competition and drilling more deeply into the market problem takes time and effort. It&rsquo;s why many businesses just stick to the time honoured process of beating Geoff or Mabel down the road. It&rsquo;s easier. That&rsquo;s all. It may not lead to success but at least you&rsquo;re all fighting with the same weapons. There&rsquo;s literally no one bringing a gun to the local knife fight.</p><p> This is what separates the true entrepreneurs from the wannabe business leaders. They work hard to peel away the layers of a particular problem, constantly asking that childish WHY, continuing until they have the workable solution within reach. Your market represents the ready-made expert who knows everything about the problem, they know how it affects them and they know what a solution should look like, even if they haven&rsquo;t got a solid product yet.</p><p> Your job as an entrepreneur is to forensically pull it apart and come up with the innovative solution that literally blows the competition out of the water. Let&rsquo;s face it, if you&rsquo;ve come up with the perfect solution to your market&rsquo;s problem who needs to make the effort to stay ahead of the competition? You will have what your market both wants and needs. </p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SellMoreTalkLes\" target=\"_blank\"> Bob Marx&nbsp;</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives &ndash; choice, not chance, and it determines your destiny.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above quote by Aristotle was displayed prominently in an office, where, oddly enough, it seemed to attract very little attention. In any case, it has made enough of an impression to invite a look at these words of wisdom and see where these words may apply.When embarking on a road trip, unless aimlessly wandering around the country is the intent, it is essential to have a destination in mind and a map.Most people in the world are living someone else&rsquo;s agenda, which is usually obtained &ldquo;by default.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stated differently, most people are on a path of aimlessly wandering &ndash; much like a traveler without a specific destination or road map.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It would be most valuable to look at different areas or aspects of life and ask &ldquo;What is the intention here?&rdquo;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the areas of family, business, spiritual practice, financial means, retirement, education, self-development, health, and social interaction. Most people, by their own admission, are not living fully actualized lives and full potential. One main cause is a lack of clear and focused direction and intention.Without clear direction, &ldquo;sincere effort&rdquo; is impossible. Perhaps effort becomes sincere when clear intention is established. Most people merely do an adequate job of trying whatever it is they are doing, because they are relatively un-inspired by the task. Sincere effort stems from high intention. It flows naturally. Look at the areas of life, where one is just &ldquo;hanging out&rdquo; or &ldquo;clocking time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>This indicates insincere effort &ndash; which is an opportunity to create a more focused and clear intention!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming that intention is present, intelligent direction is also vital. In his timeless classic, &ldquo;Think and Grow Rich&rdquo;, Napoleon Hill recommends and promotes the &ldquo;mastermind&rdquo; group.This was a group of like-minded individuals that assembled for counsel and participation in the attainment of a worthwhile goal. It acted very much like the directors of a large corporation &ndash; providing guidance, advice and direction that is essential to success. The use of the mastermind principle mirrors the use of an &ldquo;intelligent direction&rdquo; .</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>From the combined intelligence of several, comes new possibilities that simply cannot come from a single mind.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Jordan, who practiced over ten hours a day &ndash; even at the height of his career, said practicing the wrong thing eight hours a day only makes a person excellent at doing the wrong thing. Consider the practice devoted to the essential skills that brings us success as parents, spouses, employees and people in general. To excel &ndash; practice is much more important than the actual presentation or performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Out of the harsh discipline of practice, comes skillful execution.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As&nbsp;humans we tend to see in purely linear &ldquo;cause and effect&rdquo; terms. &ldquo;When given lemons, making lemonade&rdquo; is certainly simplistic, but most people who are successful have had to become adept at taking some perceived challenge and using it as an opportunity for benefit, value and profit. This comes from introspection, which is the observation of one&rsquo;s own mental act of looking within themselves to be open minded and visionary.Each of these steps, when applied, provides opportunity, challenge, impact and benefit.With these steps in mind, it is a matter of will to trade in mediocrity for excellence!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> There are ad campaigns. There are brilliant ad campaigns.</h3><strong> And then there are brilliant ad campaigns that make a massive impact for social responsibility.</strong>You know, the ones that put a fresh twist on a powerful message that shakes you, grips you, and forces you to reassess social norms you&rsquo;d formerly taken for granted.Every now and then a message campaign stands out in some brilliant and unexpected way. Here are five that, in my opinion, set the bar for genius, insight, creativity, and punch:<h3> <strong>  1. #TheDress &mdash; 2015 </strong> Black and blue. Or was it white and gold? Or was half the world color blind? Or did it depend on whether you were standing under fluorescent lights?</h3>Whatever colors you saw, only one organization saw the opportunity to make a profound social statement. South Africa&rsquo;s branch of <u> <a href=\"http://www.salvationarmy.org/ihq/news/inf060315\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Salvation Army </a></u> took #thedress that swept the internet and transformed it into something far deeper &mdash; a campaign on domestic abuse and violence against women &mdash; with the caption &ldquo;The only illusion is if you think it was her choice. One in six women are victims of abuse. Stop abuse against women.&rdquo;It was a genius move on Salvation Army&rsquo;s part, brought to life by the <u> <a href=\"http://www.ireland-davenport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ireland/Davenport </a></u> advertising agency.<u> <a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.keypersonofinfluence.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dress-salvation-army-01c-2015_aotw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"salvation army #thedress sarah k asaftei #live1face\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.keypersonofinfluence.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dress-salvation-army-01c-2015_aotw.jpg\"/> </a></u>###<h3> <strong>  2. #SaveTheChildren &mdash; 2014 </strong> Everyone loves designer clothes.</h3>But would you love them so much if you knew where they came from? Human exploitation in the fashion industry, particularly of children, is no great secret. Brazil&rsquo;s <u> Abrinq Foundation</u> drives their chilling point home, with their 25th anniversary Save The Children campaign.Top models participated in this PSA series created by Brazilian agency <u> <a href=\"http://www.lewlaratbwa.com.br/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Lew&rsquo;Lara\\TBWA </a></u>, wearing luxury outfits where children&rsquo;s fingers clutch the prison bars created by fabric stripes. &ldquo;A tunic shouldn&rsquo;t cost a childhood,&rdquo; the slogan reads.

Adults would see the image on the left &ndash; an informative but innocuous awareness message. Children under 4&rsquo;3 would see the image on the right, with a call to action and a number to call for help. This means the child gets the message even if their abuser is walking along holding their hand.Pure and total genius.<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.keypersonofinfluence.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2013-05-06_204512_thumb.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-06-02 at 7.30.53 PM\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.keypersonofinfluence.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2013-05-06_204512_thumb.jpg\"/></a> ###<h3> <strong>  4.#WhoMadeMyClothes #FashRev &mdash; 2015 </strong> Spring 2015,  <u>  <a href=\"http://fashionrevolution.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fashion Revolution  </a> </u>  launched an awareness campaign about sweatshop conditions and cheap clothing manufacturers. Reality is that both ends of the fashion spectrum &mdash; couture, and cheap items &mdash; suffer from an epidemic of heinous working conditions and in some cases, slave labor.</h3>To make their point, they placed kiosks on busy Berlin streets, selling t-shirts for just 2 euros.

    "content": "<p> \"Holding on to negative feelings and past circumstances is like placing a lock on your soul.\"</p><p> This quote can mean many things. It can be holding a grudge, harboring resentment, or simply playing the woulda&rsquo;, coulda&rsquo;, shouldas over and over again in your brain.</p><p> The way I see it, replaying negative events, feeling, and thoughts become, simply, another habit; an activity with which we have become familiar and comfortable. Even if the circumstances were good, continuing to replay them will surely stunt one&rsquo;s growth and interfere with your ability to create more enjoyable circumstances, as you habitually live in the glory of the past. Our primitive nature, controlled by our automatic brain&mdash;the AB&mdash;will cause us to fight or flee anything that it processes as dangerous, threatening, or that which makes us feel vulnerable. And that goes with habits. Even if the habits are self-destructive, this brain will force us into them because they are known, familiar, and strangely comfortable. That is what your AB does; that is what my AB does.</p><p> Holding on to the negative feelings and past circumstances may have become a habit for you. And if this habit is controlling your life then it means that you unknowingly are taking direction from your AB. This brain will have you fighting and fleeing right back to the regret and torment each time you begin to move forward. This often shows itself in anger, rage, anxiety (fight reactions) or depression (flight reactions).</p><p> And what does that cause? Each time we believe, trust, and take direction from our AB it further distances us from our soul, our mind, our divine nature. This is a part of us that is ever-present, yet locked by the constant activity of, and our belief in, our AB.  Naturally this is not great for our health and certainly not for our life.</p><p> So, how do we unlock access to our soul and begin living the life that is right for us. Action is the most powerful tool to achieve this. Self-talk and affirmations are effective, but taking action and showing yourself that it is safe to trust your soul will shortcut your results. How do you do that? <strong>   Here are six ideas to get you started. </strong></p><li> On awakening each day, decide on and  <strong>  write down one action step </strong>  you are going to take.</li><li> That action step is either  <strong>  something you have never done before </strong> , or something you have done before, but in a different way. (this could be starting a journal, for instance, or apologizing to someone, when that is not something you typically do)</li><li> Pick one day a week, and on that day, for  <strong>  every time you refer to the past, place in a jar a dollar </strong>  amount with which it is not so easy for you to part.</li><li> At the end of each week, reevaluate how you are moving on.  <strong>  Use the contents of the jar to reward you </strong>  for moving past major blocks.</li><li> Whenever you find yourself kind of getting lost in the trance of mulling over the past, to snap out of it, you have to  <strong>  distract yourself </strong> . Get up, go outside for a walk, put on music from the present day, or do something creative (or work on your hobby).</li><li> <strong>  Look for at least one person you can help each day. </strong> Doing something for someone else, not only serves to distract your preoccupation with the past, but it also gives purpose to your present.</li>",

    "content": "<p> To get your content in front of the right people at the right time, here&rsquo;s a different take on the elements of a successful content marketing strategy.</p><h3> <strong>  1 Au &ndash; Gold </strong> Widely used for monetary exchange throughout history and synonymous with wealth, gold is an element of inherent value.</h3>View your audience as equally valuable, they&rsquo;re the ones who will dig into their pockets and give you their gold. Make it a priority to understand their perceptions, their opinions and their habits. Research trumps suppositions here; make sure you&rsquo;re sure.In this list of <u> <a href=\"http://smallbiztrends.com/2014/04/missing-elements-content-strategy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  7 missing elements of your content strategy </a></u>, not understanding your audience comes in as number five. The author recommends you create content personas to help target your content and speak to them specifically.In Brazen Profit Lab&rsquo;s article <u> <a href=\"http://www.brazenprofitlab.com/ecommerce-marketing-2/a-successful-content-marketing-strategy-for-ecommerce-business-owners/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The 6 Elements to a Successful Content Marketing Strategy for eCommerce Business Owners in 2014 </a></u>, she recommends getting to &ldquo;know your audience as well as you know yourself.&rdquo; How? By doing interviews, polls, podcasts, and giving away products for review.No matter how you do it, the idea is to tailor your content to your audience. Know how they consume it, where they read it and what the context will be.Someone who&rsquo;s scanning your blog on a mobile while riding the subway home from work will want something different than someone who&rsquo;s watching your videos on their tablet over coffee at breakfast. Most importantly, know what they think about your brand so you can address and mold those opinions.<h3> <strong>  2. Fe &ndash; Iron </strong> Used in metallurgy since the 4 millennium BC, Iron was molded into tools by our ancestors, and eventually, protected 19th century warships known as Ironclads.</h3>You need an ironclad awareness and knowledge of your topic. You&rsquo;re producing content that demonstrates your particular expertise. Whether its software, small-engine repair or sales training, your content serves as a proof point for your business. The key is translating that knowledge and experience into content.Plan your content around particular pieces of knowledge or experiences; this will position you as an expert and give your audience something of value.<h3> <strong>  3. N &ndash; Nitrogen </strong> It&rsquo;s the most abundant element in our atmosphere, making up almost 80% of the air around us. Still, it goes mostly unnoticed. It&rsquo;s invisible and largely taken for granted.</h3>Without a strong message, your content will go equally unnoticed. In Neil Patel&rsquo;s article, <u> <a href=\"/category/sell/content-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Your content marketing campaign will fail without these 10 features </a></u>, he highlights the importance of knowing your message. He advocates a three-step process for developing a message that starts with a mission statement and uses that to derive core and secondary messages.Your mission statement can be a good foundation for your message, you just need to identify it and make sure it&rsquo;s a central part of your content strategy.<h3> <strong>  4. C &ndash; Carbon </strong> Carbon exists as both graphite and as diamonds. Consider the difference in value.</h3>Here&rsquo;s where a good designer and a good writer earn their keep. We&rsquo;ve all got budgets to consider, but including professionals on your content team who will deliver the best is the difference between graphite and diamonds.Writers (and other creative) are included in this article on the <u> <a href=\"http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2329123/4-Critical-Elements-of-a-Successful-Content-Marketing-Team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  4 Critical Elements of a Successful Content Marketing Team </a></u>; you&rsquo;d be wise to heed this advice. It&rsquo;s the difference between appearing professional or amateurish, between making a point or sounding preachy, between selling your product or creating content no one reads. Their job is to make you look good, make sure you let them.<h3> <strong>  5. Cs &ndash; Cesium </strong> The Caesium standard defines the second; Atomic clocks use this element to accurately mark the passage of time.</h3>You&rsquo;ll need to invest time into your content marketing strategy. There are no shortcuts. It takes time to plan, time to execute and time to manage.Producing a library of valuable content won&rsquo;t happen overnight. Set your goals appropriately and temper your expectations accordingly. Value consistent output over spurts of effort and a few months later you&rsquo;ll find yourself looking back on your work, amazed at what you&rsquo;ve produced.",

    "link": "the-politicians-guide-to-social-media-7-rules-advisors-should-use",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This post orginally appeared on SEI's Practically Speaking Blog.</p><p> Written by: <u>  Amy Sitnick </u> | <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI Practically Speaking  </u> </a></p><p> In John Anderson&rsquo;s recent blog post, he suggested that  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/client-service/5-things-the-presidential-debates-can-teach-advisors/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advisors could take some pointers from presidential candidates  </a> </u>  and pundits about being prepared and poised.</p><p> It got me thinking. Many of you have questions about how to use social media, and if you&rsquo;re following candidates, there&rsquo;s a lot you can learn this election cycle about incorporating social media into your marketing mix. </p><p> After all, what&rsquo;s the main objective of the candidates? To win the hearts and minds of their constituents. Sounds kind of like appealing to a new prospect, doesn&rsquo;t it? Social media allows you to tell your personal story and reach a broad audience, in a cost-effective way.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a walk through what you can learn about social media marketing from the leading candidates.</p><p> <strong>  1. Be where your audience is online. </strong> <br/> Back in 2012, President (and candidate) Obama took to Twitter and reddit to host chats with voters.  Since then, many politicians have beefed up their presence on Facebook and Twitter, in particular. This election, we&rsquo;re  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.gop.com/heres-how-to-find-all-the-gop-candidates-on-social-media/?cmpid=ADV-BL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   seeing broad adoption of social media channels  </a> </u>  in an effort to access different segments of the voting public &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s women, millennials, or retirees.</p><p> Depending on your own niches, you may want to consider having a presence on one or more channels to connect with your own &ldquo;districts.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2. Stick to your strategy and apply it to social. </strong> <br/> You might think, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just social media,&rdquo; a frivolous channel not really requiring much thought. That couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://uspolitics.about.com/od/CampaignsElections/tp/How-Social-Media-Has-Changed-Politics.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media has literally changed U.S. politics  </a> </u> , so candidates are wise to take it seriously.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not to say you always have to be serious. You can mix in light-hearted content about where you are and what you&rsquo;re up to, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to ground your social media strategy within your firm&rsquo;s marketing plan by making your firm&rsquo;s events and public relations efforts take center stage. That means planning ahead of time, creating a content calendar and determining your goals for your presence online first, before you start sharing.</p><p> <strong>  3. Tailor your content to each channel.  </strong> <br/> There are all kinds of channels, and one thing is for certain &ndash; they are intended for different types of interactions and content.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2976083/social-networking/why-social-media-could-swing-the-2016-presidential-election.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   For example  </a> </u> , Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s team posted a photo of her in high school to wish students a happy first day of school on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SnapChat  </a> </u> , a social messaging app used largely by millennials. However, on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/hillaryclinton/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pinterest  </a> </u>  (an image-based platform), Clinton posts images of inspiring women, family photos and pictures from the campaign trail, some of which link back to her website.</p><p> So what can you do? Post personal content about you and your staff to Facebook (namely, pictures), include some  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwback_Thursday\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;throwbacks&rdquo;  </a> </u>  (#ThrowbackThursday #TBT) and inspirational content, such as quotes or videos. You should consider keeping your LinkedIn to strictly professional content about you and your firm.</p><p> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t put an intern in charge. </strong> <br/> Just like the candidates do, it&rsquo;s a great idea to get help executing your marketing efforts. Interns can be an excellent way to do that; they&rsquo;re often digitally-savvy and hungry for experience. However, their youth and inexperience with industry regulations can cause reputational risk for you and your firm if left unsupervised.  <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trump-retweet-blunder-215072\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Just ask Donald Trump  </u>  .  </a></p><p> <strong>  5. Use social for big announcements. </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s not uncommon for news to break on Twitter, and that&rsquo;s certainly evident from many candidates who&rsquo;ve taken to social media to announce their candidacies (Hilary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, just to name a few). And  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/19/more-americans-are-using-social-media-to-connect-with-politicians/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   according to Pew  </a> </u> , 35% of people who follow candidates on social media do so because it makes them feel more personally connected to the person or group &ndash; a key objective you should adopt, as well.</p><p> So maybe you know the value of social media and you&rsquo;re not quite sure what to say (especially on a channel like Twitter)? Announce your firm news &ndash; when you&rsquo;ve published a blog post or book, or hired a great new addition to your firm. Syndicate your messages across channels (keeping #3 above in mind) and get the news out fast. And what a great channel to communicate when there&rsquo;s a market drop and you have worried clients wanting your take on what&rsquo;s happening.</p><p> <strong>  6. Pay attention to what&rsquo;s being said about you. </strong> <br/> Since its social media, it&rsquo;s not a one-way conversation. Even if you&rsquo;re not on social media, others may be sharing your content, discussing their positive experiences with your firm (such as talking about attending your client event), or (gulp) sharing a client service nightmare. In most cases, people typically take to the web only when they have really good &ndash; or really bad &ndash; things to say about something. For many political campaign employees, monitoring sentiment is likely a full-time job.</p><p> So how can you monitor what people say about you online? Try setting up  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Alerts  </a> </u>  to scour the web, actively monitor your Twitter notifications when people @mention your handle, and keep an eye on LinkedIn and Facebook comments.</p><p> <strong>  7. Broaden your reach. </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s a good idea to track your progress on social media, and one aspect of that is tracking an increase in follower count.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/10/28/ben-carson-won-wednesdays-debate-on-social-media-at-least/\" target=\"_blank\">   For example  </a> </u> , Ben Carson appears to have gained the most Twitter followers as a result of the most recent debate.</p><p> Why is that important and why should that be on your mind? It&rsquo;s just more people for you to share your point of view and platform of services with.</p><p> <strong>  Cast your ballot </strong> <br/> Whether you love social media (like me!) or not, it isn&rsquo;t going away. It&rsquo;s the key platform to watch this election season. Take a pledge now to use social media to create new relationships with clients and prospects.</p>",

    "link": "get-over-the-hype-5-reasons-the-comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Seems like everyone and their grandmother writes about why you need to break out of your comfort zone. Heck, I&rsquo;ve written about it more than a time or two. It&rsquo;s as if there is a cult of personal development and leadership bloggers proselytizing the evils of the comfort zone. Even worse, if you dare stay within your comfort zone, you might as well shrivel up and blow away into irrelevance now. Sounds like fun, right?</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s the truth: Your comfort zone serves a purpose and it&rsquo;s not your enemy. Your enemy is your fear that this is it, the end of the road, the buck stops here, (add your favorite cliche here). Does that mean that most people are consciously cowering and shaking in their comfort zone? No. </strong></p><p> Let&rsquo;s get one thing out of the way, sometimes our comfort zone is intensely uncomfortable but we stay put anyway&hellip; a bad relationship, poor eating habits, terrible boss. In these cases, from the outside, most people would argue change is not a choice. From the inside, it&rsquo;s far more complex. There are some exceptional pieces out there to help you  <u>  tap into your mental toughness through seemingly impossible change </u> .</p><h3> 5 Reasons the Comfort Zone Isn&rsquo;t Your Enemy</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. It feels good&hellip; And it&rsquo;s okay to feel good. You have permission.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Simply, it feels nice and cozy in your comfort zone. You&rsquo;re at ease, there&rsquo;s no stress, in fact, there&rsquo;s often mastery. Frequently I&rsquo;ll describe it to my clients as their sweet spot.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had a few clients tell me that their comfort zone is when they&rsquo;re in crisis. Crazy to hear but it&rsquo;s when their serenity kicks in, and they thrive on solving challenges. When there&rsquo;s no tension, they&rsquo;re bored, which is totally outside of their comfort zone.</p><p> Others have described their love of a particular sport, like swimming. In the pool, they are most in flow emotionally and physically. Ask them about running and their entire demeanor changes. Their discomfort with even the thought of running is palpable.</p><p> There&rsquo;s something wonderful about feeling masterful. Knowing your stuff and making a difference is important. </p><p> I love to bake challah from scratch whenever I get a chance. Our family only needs one, but I bake three or four loaves every time. (Clearly, I have no clue how to halve a recipe). One of my favorite parts about the baking is the sharing. I bring loaves to neighbors, teachers at school and give them to random delivery people who happen to come to our home at the right time.</p><p> Recently, my neighbor asked me what other breads I make, and I responded with the truth, none. I have no idea how and more importantly, have little desire to branch out from my favorite. The smell alone grounds me in family, love, community and all sorts of wonderful feelings. A nice rye or sourdough wouldn&rsquo;t do it for me.</p><p> Allow yourself to enjoy feeling good. As long as it&rsquo;s not stopping you from living or engaging with the world at large and people who matter, do it. Feel the ease. Be safe. Rest up&hellip; because  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/30-excuses-to-kick-to-the-curb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  change is always coming. </a></p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Give+yourself+permission+to+feel+cozy%2C+at+ease+and+totally+safe+in+your+comfort+zone.+Breathe.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Give yourself permission to feel cozy, at ease and totally safe in your comfort zone. Breathe.</a><br/> <h3> <strong>  2. Your comfort zone is not a forever zone; it&rsquo;s ever shifting </strong></h3><p> <br/> For some of us,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/10-signs-its-time-to-make-the-leap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   leaving the comfort zone is a leap  </a> </u> , like moving overseas. For others, it&rsquo;s at a snails pace, so slow, they don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s happening.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the one thing you can count on: You comfort zone is on the move. </p><p> When I moved from the USA to the Australian Outback people thought I was insane. Talk about making a leap. Three years in and I have new routines, new favorites, new safety zones and a whole new comfort zone. Yup-A-Rooney.</p><p> Instead of running away from your comfort zone in an impossible game of hide and seek, notice it, acknowledge it and accept it. Engage with your new comfort zone with intention. Explore and get to know the boundaries, the intricacies, and the holes that you desperately try to avoid.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve worked with new coaches in the field for several years. Coming out of their coach training program, they use their new skills and processes by the book. Not only do they understand them, but have demonstrated them to achieve professional recognition and certification. However, every new coaching client brings fear of walking outside of the path that they practiced over and over in the classroom.</p><p> Then something slippery and wonderful happens&hellip; the blend. They realize that their lifetime of experience is blending beautifully with their new skills. Their levels of confidence, competence and creativity are on the rise, and they see opportunities to go &ldquo;off book&rdquo; and make an impact. Their comfort zone has made a leap, and if you ask them when it happened, they can not pinpoint a single moment it time. It happened in the living of it, not only the learning.</p><p> Growth.</p><p> Take a moment to do a mental inventory of where you&rsquo;ve been, where you stand today, and where you most want to go. Chances are, you&rsquo;ve moved. Ground yourself here, lean in and celebrate your new mastery before stretching towards what&rsquo;s next.</p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=One+step+out+of+the+comfort+zone+isn%E2%80%99t+goodbye+forever.+It+travels+with+you.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> One step out of the comfort zone isn&rsquo;t goodbye forever. It travels with you.</a><br/> <h3> <strong>  3. Change thrives with rest and recovery </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve ever started a new workout routine, you know that it&rsquo;s easy to take it too far. You went from couch potato to the treadmill and lifting, pulled something and retreated to couch potato once again. Was it a bad move to step beyond your limits? No, but there is a stretch and a breaking point too.</p><p> Rest and recovery aren&rsquo;t what losers do when they&rsquo;re just too tired, lazy or afraid to keep pushing forward. It&rsquo;s what top athletes do to increase their performance. It&rsquo;s a <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-house-tour-mental-models/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  key element of self-care </a> , and it&rsquo;s non-negotiable.</p><p> Recovery within your comfort zone enables repair, mobility and focus on core strength. Funny how physical training overlaps with personal development best practices.</p><p> You tried a new approach and fell flat? Reflect and regroup.</p><p> You couldn&rsquo;t sustain the effort? Go for smaller steps instead of giant leaps.</p><p> You received negative feedback? Let your ego recover.</p><p> There are times when you take a step back to move forward. It&rsquo;s okay. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up. Instead, use your time in your comfort zone for rest and recovery, then try again.</p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=When+you+step+forward%2C+it%E2%80%99s+okay+to+step+back+to+rest+and+recover.+Growth+is+a+dance.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> When you step forward, it&rsquo;s okay to step back to rest and recover. Growth is a dance.</a><br/> <h3> <strong>  4. Danger Will Robinson! Danger! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your comfort zone keeps you safe and yes, you can argue that&rsquo;s a bad thing or a good thing. Assuming the comfort zone isn&rsquo;t your enemy, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the good.</p><p> How do you separate our the fear from true danger?</p><p> Your gut. It knows.</p><p> Gut: This is going to be hard.</p><p> Fear: Oh my gosh. You can&rsquo;t do this.</p><p> Gut: I need to prepare.</p><p> Fear: Help!</p><p> Gut: I will need help.</p><p> Fear: I&rsquo;ll definitely fail if I try.</p><p> Gut: This is going to hurt and I need to get stronger.</p><p> Fear: I&rsquo;ll never be ready.</p><p> Gut: I&rsquo;m not ready. Here&rsquo;s what I need to do.</p><p> Fear: Impossible.</p><p> Gut: I&rsquo;m nervous and it&rsquo;s worth it.</p><p> Your comfort zone is a pretty grounded place. Your gut is loud and clear in  here, even when the voice of fear tries to drown it out.</p><p> Fear sounds irrational. You know those crazy thoughts we all have from time to time.</p><p> Gut sounds like the truth. It reaches beyond the fear to keep you safely moving forward.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not a choice between being constantly being airborne or holding on for dear life. Experience the edges, prepare, and leap.</p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Live+on+the+edge+of+your+comfort+zone%2C+pushing+boundaries+before+making+leaps.&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Live on the edge of your comfort zone, pushing boundaries before making leaps.</a><br/> <h3> <strong>  5. You&rsquo;re not alone in here </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ll shout it from the rooftops again, the comfort zone is not your enemy&hellip; but your saboteur sure is. Make no mistake, your saboteur is lurking in the comfort zone with you.</p><p> Wait, what? Should you call the exterminator?</p><p> Unfortunately, the only person who can banish your saboteur is you. Above, I wrote about the shifting comfort zone and your saboteur probably wishes you never read that. Your saboteur doesn&rsquo;t want you to change or grow and will feed you lies about why you can&rsquo;t. Lies.</p><p> Your saboteur is not your gut keeping you safe; it&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/how-to-move-forward-face-fear/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   that voice of fear again  </a> </u> .</p><p> Ready for a cool trick? You can actually ask your saboteur to leave. Show &lsquo;em the door and slam it in their face. Sounds so corny, right? It works.</p><p> Your comfort zone shouldn&rsquo;t be your place of &ldquo;less than&rdquo; thinking.  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/be-exceptional-leader/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Be your big, bad, totally awesome self  </a> </u>  to the max in here. When you grow to the point where you feel suffocated in your current box, you&rsquo;ll break out&hellip; and your comfort zone will grow with you. And you don&rsquo;t need to wait, you can always leap.</p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Wave+buh-bye+to+your+saboteur+and+be+a+master+within+your+comfort+zone+before+you+%23MaketheLeap&amp;via=AlliPolin&amp;related=AlliPolin&amp;url=http://breaktheframe.com/comfort-zone-isnt-your-enemy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Wave buh-bye to your saboteur and be a master within your comfort zone before you.</a><br/> <p> Most of us will spend our lives weaving in and out to push forward to new comfort zones, one after another. The ever-shifting comfort zone allows us to breathe into new mastery and experience more of what life has to offer. Good stuff not only happens on the outside of your comfort zone, but also right where you are now.</p><p> Do I still believe that we need to break the frame? That  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/break-out-of-your-comfort-zone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you have to break out of your comfort zone  </a> </u> ? Let go and try something new? Absolutely. This is not a call to play it small but to appreciate that your comfort zone has a purpose. Acknowledge it before you move on.</p><p> If you didn&rsquo;t have a comfort zone, how would you know when you leaped forward, were in your sweet spot, or just treading water?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Do you, or your team, spend sufficient time planning your analysis?</p><p> When training analysts how to deliver more value, two topics have proved the most popular.</p><p> One is training in  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/how-socrates-can-help-you-get-a-better-brief/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   socratic questioning techniques  </a> </u> ; to get to the real business need. The other is the 9 step approach to customer analysis.</p><p> As many analysts have &ldquo;fallen into&rdquo; this line of work, rather than making a conscious education &amp; career choice, few have been trained in methodologies.</p><p> Back in the day, when Data Mining &amp; Data Warehouses were all the rage (I&rsquo;m really showing my age there),  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/tips-maximising-analytics-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CRISP-DM  </a> </u>  is one of the methodologies analysts sought to master. However, with the exponential growth of insight analysts, marketing analysts &amp; data scientists, the emphasis appears to be on just coding skills &amp; software mastery. Where this is the case, too often analysis is an unplanned art, with unreliable timescales &amp; too many &ldquo;rabbit warrens&rdquo; being explored. It is perhaps for this reason that delegates on my courses appear to really value having a high level structure to their analysis approach.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=too%20often%20%23analysis%20is%20an%20unplanned%20art%20with%20unreliable%20%23timescales&amp;via=LaughlinPaul&amp;related=LaughlinPaul&amp;url=http://customerinsightleader.com/?p=1087\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   too often #analysis is an unplanned art with unreliable #timescales  </a> </u></p><p> I call this approach the 9 step model for analysis.

When training insight teams, I&rsquo;ll also focus on  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/analysts-storytellers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   storytelling  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/tips-maximising-analytics-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data visualisation  </a> </u> , stakeholder management,  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/can-influence-top-table/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   influencing  </a> </u>  &amp;  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/create-culture-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   following up on your recommendations  </a> </u> . No wonder customer insight analyst or manager is such a challenging (as well as rewarding role). Many hybrid skills to master, including a wide range of softer skills.</p><p> On the positive side, many of these skills also equip a person well for leadership roles across Marketing and the wider business. Knowing how to think analytically, communicate effectively &amp; influence for action are core skills for leaders.</p><p> <strong>  What&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re experience of improving the capability of your Customer Insight team? </strong>  Have you focussed on developing the skills outlined above or other areas?</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the things that we would find hardest to give up is our independence, and that may be why the idea of signing a power of attorney is so difficult for many people. There are times when having a signed power of attorney in place can be a benefit to you and your family, though, even if it means that you have decided to give up your right to make decisions.</p><h3> Life Circumstances Can Change Quickly</h3><p> <br/> You have done all the right things to prepare for retirement. Your financial plan is in good shape, and you meet with your financial advisor regularly to make sure that it stays that way. Everything is going according to plan and you anticipate being the captain of your financial ship as you transition from employee to retired person. As your number of working days wind down, you find yourself thinking more and more about life after work.</p><p> You may have been distracted thinking about your new life while driving home from work one day when everything changed in a heartbeat. Instead of continuing on with neatly ordered life, you have been involved in a serious car accident and your recovery will be a lengthy one. Unfortunately, there are everyday matters, such as paying bills and other things, which will not be able to wait until you return home.</p><p> Many people just assume in such a situation their spouse or partner would be able to step in and handle their legal and financial affairs. They may even want their parents or a sibling to look after things on their behalf. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Without a Power of Attorney (actually an Enduring Power of Attorney in this situation) or a court order, your loved ones would be unable to help. And your affairs would go unmanaged.</p><h3> What is a Power of Attorney (POA)?</h3><p> <br/> A Power of Attorney (POA) is a legal document that gives an individual the authority to manage your financial and legal affairs on your behalf &ndash; &lsquo;the attorney&rsquo;. It can be a limited POA that restricts or limits assets or activities that the attorney can handle such as depositing monies in your bank account or providing instructions on your investments. The POA can be put in place for specific time periods, such as when you are traveling. A POA can also be more &lsquo;General&rsquo; giving your attorney a wide-range of control of your financial affairs. It could also be an &lsquo;Enduring&rsquo; POA.</p><h3> Why should I Consider an Enduring Power of Attorney?</h3><p> <br/> An Enduring Power of Attorney will &lsquo;endure&rsquo; or continue on in the event you become mentally incapacitated . If we use the example of the serious car accident again, which leaves you in a state where you a no longer competent to make your own decisions you could have signed an &lsquo;enduring&rsquo; Power of Attorney in advance which would continue to be valid if you were unable to look after your own affairs due to your age, illness or an accident.</p><h3> Power of Attorney and Your Overall Financial Plan</h3><p> <br/> Part of your financial planning should be to anticipate the worst and think about how you would deal with that situation while hoping it never happens. Give some thought to who you would want to look after your affairs if you could no longer make any decisions for yourself. You can also appoint more than one person as your attorney. It&rsquo;s very important to make sure that the person(s) you appoint is(are) someone you can trust implicitly. You are, after all, entrusting that person(s) to treat your assets as if they were his or her own while the Power of Attorney is in effect.</p><p> It may be awkward but you will also need to discuss your wishes with the person(s) you have chosen to act for you. Now if you don&rsquo;t appoint someone as your attorney and you suddenly you become incapacitated (say due to a car accident), your loved ones would have to apply to the courts to have someone appointed to manage your affairs. This often is a lengthy (and always an expensive) process. So having a Power of Attorney in place can make an emotionally challenging situation a bit more manageable.</p><p> Now Powers of Attorney do have limitations. Specifically, they do not allow your attorney to make personal care and health decisions on your behalf. In British Columbia, you would need a Representation Agreement, which is a legal document which allows you to appoint one or more representative(s) to act on your behalf. Your representative can then handle your legal and financial affairs in addition to your personal care and health care needs. Just like with a Power of Attorney, you can name more than one person to handle different aspects of your affairs should you become unable to look after them.</p><p> Both Powers of Attorney and Representation Agreements end upon your death or if you choose to revoke them in writing.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A former colleague used to say, &ldquo;One size may fit all, but it will do so badly.&rdquo;</p><p> Startups tend to focus on universal answers and simple solutions.  We know that issues are more complicated and each business needs its own customization. One-size fits all solutions are easier to understand and technologically easier to execute.  However, if you realize some of the complexities of these solutions, then it can be easy to adapt them to individual situations.</p><p> Consider the following:</p><h3> Multiple Goals</h3><p> <br/> Businesses have multiple goals and realities.  Many entrepreneurs are so excited with the idea of becoming the next Zuckerberg that they completely ignore the need to make a profit and execute.  There are many factors that businesses have to contend with besides their overall profit margin.  Things like the skills, success, and the financial planning of the business.  Also, factors like the environment, safety, and social trends are areas where business owners have no control.</p><h3> Ceteris Paribus (this is Latin for a really important fact)</h3><p> <br/> Translated, it means &ldquo;every business plan or analysis assumes certain assumptions that must be valid for the analysis to be useful.&rdquo;   For example, if the price of beef goes up because there is less beef available, we would say that the price of beef increased because of a decreased supply.  We would not consider anything else like new FDA rules, or the price of other meat increasing or decreasing.</p><p> We frequently make prolonged and analytical arguments to describe the potential of our businesses and ignore the ceteris paribus part.</p><p> As I introduce this topic in my workshops, I also add the caveat that while it is the first concept taught in economics class, it&rsquo;s oftentimes the first concept forgotten when the student go into business.</p><p> Take these categories: Weather, war, inflation, the economy, and politics.  These can, and do, affect business decisions.  Changes in our lives like iPhones, gay marriage, healthcare, social media, the baby boomer generation, and population diversity are all significantly affecting business decisions.  Just consider the notion of &ldquo;online shopping,&rdquo; and what that has meant to each and every business.  Who would have thought of it just ten to fifteen years ago.</p><h3> Bias</h3><p> <br/> Important issues like bias, prejudice, and yes, even ignorance, are also complexities that must be address.  Business decisions are made by the accumulation of data, by measurements, and analysis, and how it is used, or ignored, can be devastating to a business.  Here are some reasons how:</p><li> Seeking information that supports our favored hypothesis, and avoids information that contradicts it.</li><li> Giving preference to positive information and ignoring details. For example, we frequently develop huge general market estimates that ignore the specifics of our target. For example, grandparents get a pass in bragging about their grandkids, but that should not extend to business decisions.</li><li> Looking for winners, especially in describing startup success stories and ignoring the failures.</li><li> Ignoring negative evidence. In particular, the more invested we are in a project or product, the less we are willing to abandon it. <br/>  </li><h3> Cognitive Dissonance</h3><p> <br/> We all talk about losing weight, and then explain how a little bit of cheesecake won&rsquo;t hurt, or that a brownie made with cocoa is not really high in fat.  This is &ldquo;cognitive dissonance,&rdquo; when we justify behavior based on prior beliefs.</p><p> Much of the discussion on business decisions is based on cultural and economic perspectives of the participants. We also tend to avoid actions that can be contrary to the message a business aims to convey.</p><p> Many of these issues can be simplified by including social and environmental factors in creating and executing business programs:</p><li> Including behavioral science considerations can be a refreshing approach to small business analysis. In addition, we should be less constrained by our dependence on single disciplines.  I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on using pricing to advocate strategies like bundling, freemium, psychological pricing, value, increasing volume and profit. Google and Amazon are key examples of companies that use untraditional efforts to improve profits and stock value.</li><li> Sports team loyalty may be the best example, &ldquo;My team can do no wrong while your team is just evil.&rdquo;</li><li> Every business owner needs to keep a lot of plates spinning in order to properly plan, i.e., expectations, uncertainty, psychology, culture, risk, quality control, consumer confidence and values.  The world of sports is a great example:  they are now incorporating analytics more than ever before to predict outcomes as opposed to &ldquo;gut and experience.&rdquo;</li><li> It has been told that 90% of startups fail.  However, keeping the energy and commitment level high, and being conscious of the expected AND the unexpected, your business will not be one of them.</li>",

    "link": "how-stocks-and-bonds-reacted-to-previous-rate-hikes",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> With an interest rate hike looming sooner rather than later, we thought it may be useful to look back at what happened when the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates the last few times.</h3><p> <br/> We consider only those instances when the Fed raised the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) after more than two years of keeping rates steady, or lowering them. This criterion leaves us with only three episodes over the past thirty years, namely February 1994, June 1999 and June 2004 (data from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/statistics/dlyrates/fedrate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NY Fed  </a> </u> ). It leaves out several instances of rate increases in the 1980&rsquo;s that were interspersed with a drop in rates, but all of these were within a year or so of the previous rate increase.</p><p> The following graphic compares economic conditions during these episodes, particularly, inflation as measured by core personal consumption expenditures (PCE &ndash; the Fed&rsquo;s preferred measure), Federal Funds target rate (effective) and unemployment rate.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Core-PCE-vs-fed-funds-rate-vs-UE-rate.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Core PCE vs fed funds rate vs UE rate\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Core-PCE-vs-fed-funds-rate-vs-UE-rate.png\"/> </a></p><h3> <strong>  How did stocks react? </strong></h3><p> <br/> As a special case, we also consider the period of the  <u>  <a href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/article/10036\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Taper Tantrum  </a> </u> , triggered by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke&rsquo;s comments to Congress in May 2013 that the Fed would likely start slowing/tapering the pace of its bond purchases later in the year. This is not a typical case of the Fed hiking rates but is the most recent instance of a stated intent to start tightening monetary policy.</p><p> The following table looks at equity market (S&amp;P 500 Index) returns over 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the date on which the rate hike was announced, or Bernanke&rsquo;s statement in the case of the Taper Tantrum. To establish a baseline for comparison, we also looked at returns over the same periods prior to the rate hike. Note that these periods are in terms of trading days.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SP-500-returns.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"S&amp;P 500 returns\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SP-500-returns-1024x280.png\"/> </a></p><p> Interestingly, in all four cases, the S&amp;P 500 had positive returns over 1, 3, 6-month and 1-year periods prior to the rate hike. However, we see this quickly reversed in the month following the announcement.  The S&amp;P 500 also had negative returns over the next three months in all cases except for the summer of 2013. As a reaction to the &ldquo;tantrum&rdquo;, the Fed set out to convince the market that an intention to taper bond purchases in 2013 was conditioned on data and would not immediately be followed by an increase in rates, resulting in an equity market rally. Over the longer periods of 6-months and 1-year, in all four instances we see that S&amp;P 500 returns, while positive, are considerably lower than the corresponding period prior to the announcement.</p><p> To understand a little more how the market moved after, and prior to, the rate hike, we also look at the daily volatility (annualized) and maximum drawdown experienced by the S&amp;P 500 over these same periods.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SP-500-volatility.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"S&amp;P 500 volatility\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SP-500-volatility-1024x280.png\"/> </a></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SP-500-max-drawdown.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"S&amp;P 500 max drawdown\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SP-500-max-drawdown-1024x298.png\"/> </a></p><p> It does not appear as if daily volatility increases during the post rate hike phase compared to prior periods. In fact, volatility is slightly higher in the month preceding the rate hike, perhaps in anticipation of it, compared to the following month. A significant outlier is 2013, the month following Bernanke&rsquo;s statement (triggering the Taper Tantrum).</p><p> However, the picture is a little different when we consider maximum drawdowns. The periods following a rate hike announcement typically exhibit larger drawdowns than corresponding periods prior to the announcement. This is more pronounced in the 1-3 month periods following the rate hike.</p><p> The data, limited as it is since we have only four precedents, does appear to indicate that the immediate period following a rate hike announcement (1-3 months) is accompanied by negative equity market returns and larger drawdowns than the market experienced in the prior period. However, we do see bit of a rally three months removed from the first rate hike. Note that in each instance of the initial FFR increase that we consider here, the Fed continued to raise rates at more or less the same pace over the next four to five meetings.</p><h3> <strong>  What happened to bond yields? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The larger impact when the Fed raises rates is potentially on bond yields &ndash; so, what did yields look like before and after rate hikes? The next table shows the yield on the US 10-year treasury on the day of the rate hike, as well as over several periods before and after.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/UST-10-year-rate.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"UST 10-year rate\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/UST-10-year-rate-1024x267.png\"/> </a></p><p> In every case, except for 2004, the yield on the US 10-year treasury rose more than 60 basis points over the 6-month period following a rate hike announcement. In contrast, the period following the first rate hike in 2004 shows yields falling almost 60 basis points over the year. This is quite curious since the period in question was accompanied by core inflation running higher than the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target and GDP (nominal) rising at an annualized rate of more than 6%. Yields eventually did rise to more than 5% by April of 2006.</p><p> For the most part, it would seem logical that the immediate period (1-3 months) following a rate hike should see interest rates rising, particularly on the short end of the yield curve, as a result of the Fed tightening monetary policy. At the same time, based on the precedents discussed above, especially the strong market reactions to the taper tantrum, equity markets may be in store for a period of negative returns and larger drawdowns in the immediate aftermath of a rate hike announcement. More so when you account for the fact that the last time the Fed raised rates was June 2006, more than nine years ago.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When I began my sales career all those years ago, I was told that at the bottom of all successful sales was a transfer of emotion &ndash; my manager told me that I was either transferring my positive feelings about my product onto my buyer, or he/she was transferring their negative feelings about it to me.  <strong>  Whoever was able to transfer more of their emotion and feeling won.  </strong></p><p> Now that may seem a bit simplistic to you now, but if you look at the essence of it, there is a lot of truth to it.  You&rsquo;ve probably heard some of the sayings like, &ldquo;Enthusiasm sells!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Whoever has the strongest reasons to buy or not buy usually wins,&rdquo; and things like that.  My question to you is: &ldquo;Are you enthusiastically presenting your product or service on every call?&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you know the difference between having a good day and having a bad day, right?  Have you ever noticed how on fire you are right after a big sale?  You&rsquo;re positive, on top of the world, unstoppable, right?  This is why good sales managers tell their reps to &ldquo;get back on the phone while you&rsquo;re hot.&rdquo;  Have you ever noticed how objections aren&rsquo;t quite so bad when you&rsquo;re in such a positive mood?</p><p> And the converse is true as well, isn&rsquo;t it?  Have you ever noticed how, when you&rsquo;re having a bad day, it&rsquo;s easy to be put off when cold calling and how you don&rsquo;t pitch with quite the same level of power?  Have you even given up after being put off or after an objection, only to then say something like this to yourself: &ldquo;Well, this just isn&rsquo;t my day.  Maybe I should just stop calling today and try again tomorrow?&rdquo; </p><h3> If you&rsquo;re in sales, then I bet you can relate to both of those scenarios, can&rsquo;t you?</h3><p> <br/> What I&rsquo;ve found over the years is that most sales people let their prospect&rsquo;s mood affect and lead theirs rather than the other way around.  After listening to thousands of calls over the years, I can hear how a sales rep&rsquo;s voice drops or slumps as soon as a prospect cuts them off or tells them they don&rsquo;t have much time, or worse, that they don&rsquo;t really see the value in their product or service.</p><h3> Top reps, on the other hand, have a different approach.  They know that it is their job to transfer their belief and attitude to their prospects, and they stand ready with a list of &ldquo;Power Statements&rdquo; that help get their prospect into the proper mindset.  They then overwhelm them with their positive attitude and don&rsquo;t give up until they get the sale. </h3><p> <br/> Here are a few statements you should have ready at all times when you&rsquo;re closing or cold calling.  Any one of these can mean the difference between who catches whose attitude and who sells who:</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #1 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;________ once you truly understand how this works, you&rsquo;ll be as impressed as I was during my interview here.  Let me take just a moment to fill you in&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #2 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, I guarantee you&rsquo;ll be 100% happy you took just a moment with me to show you what this can do for you&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #3 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Are you ready to be amazed today? &ndash; because after I show you the changes we&rsquo;ve made to this (product or service), you&rsquo;ll be more than surprised.  Go ahead and open that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #4 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;________, virtually nothing that you know about this (product or service) has remained the same &ndash; in fact, we&rsquo;ve made every part of it better and added some features that you&rsquo;ll soon never be able to live without.  For example&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #5 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you wouldn&rsquo;t mind learning why we&rsquo;re the best selling (your product or service) in the marketplace, so let&rsquo;s do this &ndash; go ahead and open that email and let me point out just two things that make us number one&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #6 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, you do want to go with the best company you can for this with the best customer support and loyalty program, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #7 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;________, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to speak with you today.  I&rsquo;ve just had an update that will knock your socks off!  Do me a favor and grab that brochure&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #8 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to speak with you today!  So much good news has happened since we spoke last that I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin.  Tell you what, let&rsquo;s start by reviewing that email I sent you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #9 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, there are three things that make me excited to come to work every day, and they also make all my clients excited to sign up with us.  The first is&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #10 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, are you ready to finally get the best (your product or service) on the market today?  If so, then grab a pen and get ready to take some notes: I&rsquo;ve got some exciting things to tell you today&hellip;&rdquo;</p><h3> If Prospect is Negative:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Positive Statement #11 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If that were true I wouldn&rsquo;t be representing this&hellip;  The fact is, most people don&rsquo;t fully understand how this works, but once they do, they understand why we&rsquo;re the number one product on the market.  Let&rsquo;s do this&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Positive Statement #12 </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Let me tell you just three reasons why we&rsquo;re the number one brand in this industry, and if you still aren&rsquo;t interested after that, then we&rsquo;ll part friends.  The first is our world class customer support&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, by using these kinds of statements you are the one setting the tone of the call.  Never forget that enthusiasm does sell, and always check your attitude before you pick up the phone &ndash; and have these statements ready!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Thinking time.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s the advice I didn&rsquo;t expect.</p><p> <strong>  \"Make sure you have thinking time\", </strong> says Jeff, the genial CEO of a global manufacturing giant, to his audience of high potential leaders.</p><p> Keep track of things you want to think about more. Jot them down. After a short pause, Jeff adds: <strong>  \"Schedule your thinking time.\" </strong></p><p> Spoken by a man who, I trust, never has enough time. Addressed to an audience who never has enough time, either.</p><p> Thinking time is common in ideation jobs. R &amp; D. Even here, thinking often equals group-thinking-time. When individuals in the group haven&rsquo;t had private thinking time, 9 out of 10 times group thinking generates more of the familiar.</p><p> Thinking lite. Pretend-ideation. Same old story.</p><p> <strong>  How, then, do we carve out individual, dive-down-deep thinking time? </strong></p><p> Some thoughts:</p><h3> 1. Purposeful thinking, not accidental thinking</h3><p> You may have excellent brain-food habits. Listen to a podcast on your way to work. Read a book before you go to bed. Think about things while you jog. Great habits. I consider them accidental thinking behaviors.</p><p> Purposeful thinking, however, happens when we stop all other activity and contemplate one simple question, one essential dilemma. This singular focus, which may incorporate resources like a podcast or a book, accelerates the deep dive. The fresh insight. The next-level-thought.</p><h3> 2. Ritualized thinking time</h3><p> Study the habits of highly successful people, and a few things become clear: Nearly all of them are morning people. Many of them have morning habits that set them up for success. Meditation and morning exercise are at the top of this list.</p><p> In addition, most have 15 or 30 minutes in their schedule, first thing in the AM, when they have no appointments. Get-focused-on-the-day time. Think-ahead time. Ritualized private thinking time. Every day. This time is not negotiated away for the occasional international phone call. It is sacred time.</p><h3> 3. Monthly thinking retreat</h3><p> One way to generate substantial thinking time: Keep track of issues, concerns, ideas you wish to consider in-depth. Give yourself half a day each month to just think. Schedule this half day. Leave the office for this period of time. Go to a thought-inducing environment. Ignore your phone and emails, if at all possible. See what happens.</p><h3> 4. Track time</h3><p> You are likely tracking time, as is. How much of it you spend in meetings, how much in phone calls, how much performing essential tasks. Great. Why not also track how much time you spend in purposeful thought? Tracking is especially helpful when we aspire to a certain standard. How much time in a given week, month do you wish to spend in thought instead of tactical execution? Decide, and track. Ways of carving out thinking time will be revealed.</p><p> Jeff, of course, was right. Thinking time is one way in which we energize ourselves. When we are energized we energize others. When we are collectively energized, business is better. Always.</p><h3> Please, think.</h3><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Congress is about to curtail two little-known, but very useful, benefits of Social Security. </strong> These are the ability to file-and-suspend and to file a restricted application. At the time of this writing, Congress had not formally passed the bill but it was expected to pass within days.</p><p> Remember when Paul Ryan proposed we extend the full retirement age for Social Security from age 67 to 69 over a 40-year time period? The media went ballistic. Senior citizen groups sponsored TV ads of Paul Ryan dumping grandma over the cliff. His proposal never saw the light of day.</p><p> Fast forward to the current Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, a bill that will cost Social Security recipients far more in benefits in the near future than Ryan&rsquo;s proposal. <strong>  Yet there has been nowhere near the outcry from the media, either political party, or the President. </strong></p><h3> Why? The benefits that the budget bill strips from the Social Security program are little known by the average American and a bit complex, even though they can add up to tens of thousands of dollars of immediate cash benefits for nearly all Social Security recipients.</h3><p> <br/> What Congress passed, and the President says he will sign, ends a benefit called file-and-suspend. This applies to married couples. It allows the higher-earning spouse to file for Social Security at full retirement age (currently 66), but to suspend taking the benefit so it can increase by 8% a year until age 70. This enables the lower-earning spouse to begin receiving spousal benefits by filing a restricted application for spousal benefits only.  The lower-earning spouse's own benefit continues to increase by 8% per year as well.</p><p> The legislation will disallow that benefit and restrict the lower-earning spouse from receiving the spousal benefit until the higher-earning spouse actually starts receiving payments. <strong>  This means if you wait until 70 to take the highest monthly Social Security benefit possible, your spouse will also have to wait until you turn 70 to receive spousal benefits. </strong></p><p> As an example, assume Tyler's full retirement age benefit is $3,000 per month. His spouse Dana, the same age, has a full retirement benefit of $500. Under the current program, Dana could receive three times more, or $1,500 a month, at age 66, even though Tyler suspends his right to begin receiving his monthly benefit. By waiting until age 70, he would see his benefit grow to closer to $4,000 a month. Under this legislation, Dana would have to wait until age 70 to take the $1,500 spousal benefit. This costs the couple $1,500 a month for four years, or $72,000.</p><p> <strong>  The second benefit stripped under this act affects everyone covered under the Social Security program, whether married or not. </strong> It is another option available when you file-and-suspend. Currently, when you hit full retirement age and decide to suspend taking your benefit, you have the option to change your mind at any time before age 70 and retroactively receive your benefits.</p><p> This benefit is incredibly valuable in certain cases. Suppose, for example, Edgar has decided to wait until age 70 to begin receiving benefits but, at age 69, he becomes terminally ill. He could file to retroactively claim all three years of lost benefits. If Edgar's full benefit amount were $3000 a month, the total retroactive benefit would be $108,000. This option is wiped out under the legislation.</p><p> Those currently receiving these benefits will become grandfathered under the legislation and continue to receive them. However, anyone currently qualifying for file-and-suspend benefits but not receiving them has until six months after Congress passes the Budget Act to complete the filing process.</p><p> <strong>  While not all Social Security recipients will be affected by these changes, for those who are the impact will be significant. </strong></p>",

We found Rich's enthusiasm contagious and his views on Schwab's program quite enlightening.</h3><strong> Douglas Heikkinen:</strong>Rich you have such a well-known firm, I&rsquo;m curious as to in building such a great firm, why you felt a need to reach out to Schwab to participate in some of these programs?<strong> Rich Steinberg:</strong>When you really think about it, our industry for the most part is small businesses. Like a lot of us who came out of large institutions and left large institutions for many reasons. Then as the firms get bigger you start looking like the large institutions that you left.There's a balance that everybody&rsquo;s trying to create of driving revenues and driving the right deliverables to clients but not fall back into the stage of being a big company again. I&rsquo;m thinking most of us are struggling with succession, running the business, personnel, that include group hiring and development and certain strategic development.We all have kind of concerns about the tools that we go into the business with. A lot of those questions are starting to come up at firms.  We&rsquo;re part of my advisor group called the Advisor Forum &mdash; which is probably forty billion collectively and we are all struggling with these things so what makes it interesting is Schwab is creating a toolbox that I think a lot of leadership firms can use. It&rsquo;s really applicable across the spectrum of this RIA space because nobody is interested or used to running businesses.<strong> Doug:</strong> You have heard about some of these tools first from that group, from others who had experiences?<strong> Rich</strong>: Yes, I mean so what kind of happened with our group is like the Moss Adams study we heard about years ago, but our group decided to follow the matrix when you guys started to follow the industry comp study, and particularly we had to do it for you anyway so we might as well do it as a more &lsquo;reach to all&rsquo; group, so it kind of swapped partnership within kind of driving thought process. It&rsquo;s really been adopted at many levels within the study groups.The problem is, that there are not many firms that are with study groups, so resources like this jump out.<strong> Doug:</strong>Schwab&rsquo;s strategy is to go very deep and so that&rsquo;s why they created an Executive Leadership Program that one of your people went through. Can you talk a little bit about what they got out of that?<strong> Rich:</strong> It has far exceeded any of my expectations, I thought he was going to come back with some tools, so really everything from like counseling me on strategy to personal compensation &hellip; kind of what we do well, what we&rsquo;ve done too well, positioning ourselves within our market.Also a lot of succession planning&rsquo;s issues that we are going through as we have two older partners so all of a sudden it was really me driving these conversations and as the firm gets bigger it's harder and harder to have one person who&rsquo;s like pulling the trigger on all of these things. Like many firms we have a lot of Gen-X in our firm.They are not really ready to grab the reigns and really make some of the bigger decisions. They haven&rsquo;t had the training yet. It gave Ken &mdash; who went through the program &mdash; two things next in particular; the ability to address with them with me in a bigger way or forceful way, it gave him the confidence to make decisions.<strong> Doug:</strong> What did Ken came back with that helped you do more evaluation around your strategic plan and some other things as well, as a result of this program?<strong> Rich:</strong>Yes, so within Nick&rsquo;s (Nick Georgis) group there's a strategic route. A few years ago we developed a strategic plan from Nicks group and we have changed how quickly we grew.  So four years ago, we were probably a 400 million &hellip; 450 firm, we are now 750.A lot of it was executing to a one, three, or five-year plan. Once you start getting above four or five million in revenue it starts to get very hard to move the needle because you need larger accounts and you need to make sure of your margin. The training that Ken got of client segmentation, pricing, formulas of pricing, what we should be our savings, our resources in marketing, so we&rsquo;ve created two new initiatives after that program.One was outside my comfort zone and one was inside my comfort zone. It&rsquo;s really starting to work, we never would have been able to drop this if we weren't working in the Schwab program.<strong> Doug:</strong>That&rsquo;s great. When we started talking to Nick about exploring this area we had no idea &mdash; we knew how many programs there were &mdash; but we had no idea how much depth they went to, and has that surprised you that Schwab offers this kind of stuff?<strong> Rich:</strong>It doesn&rsquo;t surprise us that they are offer it, I think the big challenge is how do you scale it. It&rsquo;s a great secret and as people find out about it &hellip; in small groups it's going to be harder and harder to keep pushing groups through there.Why we&rsquo;re a partner with Schwab to begin with, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was John Coghlan, or if it&rsquo;s Bernie and Nick's group. Nick worked through all of those leaders. There&rsquo;s always been a need for one to grow the industry, grow it with ethics and have discipline about the growth. The amount of resources that they put into these types of programs has really been kind of consistent with what we consider to be the leader of custodians.We don't see it with the other custodians and we work with other custodian.We're in the process of firing Pershing and all of our money is coming over and a lot of that really was because of this program. You have to kind of reward the people that are investing in you.<strong> Doug:</strong> That&rsquo;s a great statement.<strong> Rich:</strong>We really believe in what Nick is doing.<strong> Doug:</strong>From our other interviews you're not alone.<strong> Rich:</strong>I don't like to give Nick compliments a lot, but this been an unbelievable experience for us. If I had another person through the program which I don't right now, I would try to jump at it. It's really time for other firms to be able to get the boost on this.",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s pretty widely accepted that all types of consumers today are demanding products and services that cater specifically to their unique needs &mdash; whether in apparel, media, investments, etc. Companies that truly deliver personalization are reaping the benefits of higher customer loyalty and profit margins, more rewarding relationships with customers, and better insights into how to stay ahead of the competition.</p><h3> <strong>  Technology Is Rapidly Increasing Customer Expectations </strong></h3>Technology has led customers to expect a high level of personalization in everything they buy. Companies such as Nike, Coca-Cola and Facebook are using personalization to grow their brands and deliver great user experiences. According to a report by Bain &amp; Company, companies that personalize are discovering that they can elevate customer loyalty and engagement &mdash; and use their customer base as an engine of advocacy to potential buyers.1The investment industry is starting to take notice of the power of personalization. I wrote about this development earlier this year in <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=1586\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Navigator Insights</a>.The following chart from Advisorpedia illustrates how you can use personalization to help deliver a better client experience and protect your bottom line.2<strong> Process First, Personalization Second</strong>In order to provide sustainable and scalable personalization, advisors must have a sound process in place first. Buyers should be wary of companies that slap on the &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; label without laying the foundation for a great product or service beforehand.I&rsquo;d argue that companies, especially financial services companies, cannot start with personalization. In other words, think of personalization as something that only the most process-driven companies can deliver in a scalable way. In this article we&rsquo;ll explore three unsavory results that can be driven by faulty personalization &mdash; and how to avoid them.<h3> <strong>  The Leaning Tower of Pisa Personalized Portfolio </strong></h3>In this scenario, investments are chosen without a strong foundation. They lack discipline and restraint and don&rsquo;t stand the test of time. Just like the Leaning Tower of Pisa began to tilt due to inadequate foundational support, investment strategies that aren&rsquo;t grounded in sound investment methodologies may struggle to keep up to with clients&rsquo; needs.<h3> <strong>  The &ldquo;Have It Your Way&rdquo; Personalized Portfolio </strong></h3>Hold the pickles, hold the ketchup! Remember Burger King&rsquo;s <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJXzkUH72cY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;Have it Your Way&rdquo; campaign? </a></u> Some firms remind me a lot of the old-school pitch from Burger King. They promise a lot upfront about helping investors craft the perfect allocation for their needs, but at the end of the day, everybody gets the 60/40 portfolio. In other words, you&rsquo;re getting the Whopper &hellip; whether you need it or not.<h3> <strong>  The Label Lover Personalized Portfolio </strong></h3>Just like Coca-Cola&rsquo;s now famous &ldquo;Share a Coke&rdquo; campaign, many companies cut and paste the client&rsquo;s name and some relevant information about them on a product made with the same old cookie cutter formula. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing if your formula is Coca-Cola. But think about your distribution model. If you&rsquo;re simply slapping an investor&rsquo;s name on a cookie cutter strategy, that investor may begin to question the value you bring them for the price you&rsquo;re commanding. I&rsquo;d argue this is the scariest place to be right now, as online automated investment platforms are beginning to roll out similar products and services that aim to cut out the middle man.<h3> <strong>  A Clearly Defined Process Is Paramount </strong></h3>Whether you are managing clients&rsquo; assets yourself or outsourcing to a third party asset manager, you need to be able to clearly articulate your investment process to clients. In an age of rising client expectations, having a clearly defined process before offering personalization is paramount. Create a visual roadmap for how you construct personalized investments to show your clients that you have a disciplined approach and aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;winging it.&rdquo; And consider working together with the client to build the allocation together. The process of co-creation and collaboration can help clients truly understand the value you bring them, and it can provide clients with a sense of control when it comes to committing to their strategy through the ups and downs of the markets.A great portfolio construction process, plus great investments, delivered in a straightforward manner to clients, can help set you apart from the competition (and yes, that includes the robo-advisors). <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=1857\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Here are some easy-to-implement tips</a> on learning from the robos and using their ideas to separate yourself from your competition.In an industry that is increasingly facing commoditization and compressed margins, personalization may be able to help you elevate your value proposition and protect your profits. But as with any enhanced service model, start with the basics first.1.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Alicia Eu </u></p><h3> Media is no longer necessarily the most powerful nor the most effective channel for brands to influence or communicate with their audiences.</h3>In reality, the scales of power and influence have shifted toward your clients and prospects as they take advantage of social media platforms to voice their fears, concerns and praise for brands.In a digital universe saturated with the voices of the people, those with social influence &ndash; individuals or groups who can cause behavioral change (intentionally or unintentionally) &ndash; are becoming increasingly important for brands to engage with in order to reach a greater audience with relevant messages that may resonate with them.In fact, we recently practiced what we preached with a piece of <u> <a href=\"/fintech-center\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content </a></u> we developed and an influencer with a significant social media following. As the chart shows, we were able to spike downloads of our content (the content was gated so each download produced a lead in our database) through our own networks by 1.79 times when we asked an industry influencer to share with his network. That&rsquo;s 133% new leads we would not have without the sway of the influencer.Here are a few additional facts on why social influence can be powerful tools for to improve positive perceptions on brands:<li> <u>  <a href=\"http://offers.hubspot.com/guide-influencer-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  shows that a mere 3% of influential individuals generate 90% of impact online</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-business-trends-2014/498129\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   74% of consumers  </a> </u>  rely on social media to influence their purchasing decisions</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-business-trends-2014/498129\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   81% of consumers  </a> </u>  are influenced by their friends&rsquo; posts on social media when making purchasing decisions</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-business-trends-2014/498129\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   71% of consumers  </a> </u>  that receive a quick brand response on social media are likely to recommend that brand to others</li>The challenge for communication consultants is how to identify and build relationships with influencers to achieve reach, relevance and resonance.Here&rsquo;s how:<strong> Step 1.</strong>Embrace an integrated communications approach <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/from-old-world-to-new-step-one-in-making-content-marketing-work-for-your-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> ( <u>  that&rsquo;s owned, earned and paid media </u> )</a><strong> Step 2.</strong>Develop an influencer marketing strategy using the following steps:<li> Identify the topics you want your brand to be known for</li><li> Identify the right influencers for your brand based on content quality, alignment of values to your   brand, reach (here&rsquo;s a  <u>  great list of tools to identify influencers </u> )</li><li> Build relationships with your target influencers with relevant content, incentives, open communication and share feedback. Remember to give first, ask second</li><strong> Step 3.</strong>Produce killer content and marry it to your influencer marketing so you can segment your audience based on specific criteria (here&rsquo;s a useful <u> <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/?s=content\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  guide </a></u> on how to make content marketing work in financial services).<strong> Step 4.</strong>Use metrics to assess whether you need to refine your approach. You may want to consider measuring increases in online brand mentions, engagement, followers, leads or whatever is important to your business.<strong> Partnering with influencers can be beneficial for your brand because they have the power to increase your brand&rsquo;s reach, drive brand perceptions and stimulate purchasing decisions.</strong>",

    "content": "<p> In my last post I looked at  <a href=\"http://paulitaylor.com/2015/10/30/why-change-fails-four-ways-to-hack-your-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   why change fails  </u>    </a> and how most corporate programmes are destined for failure. Year on year, huge resources are invested in them. Yet we somehow hope for a different outcome. </p><h3> The biggest reason change fails is employee resistance. Indeed &ndash; it&rsquo;s the downfall of nearly 40% of programmes.</h3><p> <br/> However, this isn&rsquo;t employees trying to block change &ndash; rather they never thought it necessary in the first place. It&rsquo;s a solution to a problem that they don&rsquo;t recognise.</p><p> One of the big lessons I&rsquo;ve learned from working in innovation is pretty much everyone thinks their idea needs attention. In reality almost always there&rsquo;s a need for a more detailed problem definition before we run off changing things.</p><p> <strong>  Lack of clarity about the problem we are trying to fix can lead to the Unholy Trinity: </strong></p><li> <strong>  ​Corporate Initiative-itis: </strong> The condition of equating innovation with being busy &ndash; whilst forgetting about scrutiny and evaluation.</li><li> <strong>  Vanity Projects: </strong> Things that only got pushed through because of seniority, overly generous funding or organisational arrogance.</li><li> <strong>  Walking Dead: </strong> Projects that look good on paper but don&rsquo;t actually solve anyone&rsquo;s problem &ndash; whilst costing a lot of (usually someone else&rsquo;s) money. <br/>  </li><p> All three are the result of ill defined objectives or poor impact evaluation.</p><h3> To learn more we need to look at how successful change adoption really happens.</h3><p> <br/> What the invention of the tea bag teaches us about change</p><p> The tea bag was originally intended as a non-consumer item. It was a way to provide restaurants with small samples of leaves before they placed orders. Tea leaves were packed and sown into small silk bags with instructions to slit open the bag with a knife, pour the leaves out, and put them into a sieve and brew.</p><p> But instead of opening the bags, potential customers found that it was faster to just throw the bag into a cup and pour boiling water directly over it.</p><p> <strong>  This unintended innovation solved three problems: </strong></p><li> <strong>  No more messy leaves going all over the place. </strong></li><li> <strong>  The elimination of a complex brewing process. </strong></li><li> <strong>  A form of easy disposal &ndash; just throw the bag in the bin. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The fact it solved multiple problems made it relatively easy to market teabags. Customers recommended to other customers as it made their lives easier. The change went viral.  </p><p> But most corporate initiatives aren&rsquo;t tea bags. They often don&rsquo;t solve ANY problem, never mind three at once. And rarely is the change introduced anywhere other than from the top. </p><p> Change for change&rsquo;s sake doesn&rsquo;t always result in progress.</p><h3> Start with the problem</h3><p> <br/> A good starting point is this:</p><p> <a href=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/change-001.jpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Change.001\" src=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/change-001.jpeg?w=639&amp;h=479\"/> </a></p><h3> Just being new isn&rsquo;t good enough anymore.</h3><p> <br/> We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of unlimited resources. Public trust in innovation is no longer implicit.  We know from the Edelman Trust Barometer that innovation on its own is not perceived as an inherent demonstration of forward progress, despite the near reverence for the term.</p><p> 51% of people think the pace of change is too great , with many &lsquo;innovations&rsquo; appearing untested and unproven.</p><p> All across the social sector we are in for a tough decade. With the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills  <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/how-cut-40-science-and-innovation-spending-if-you-really-must?utm_term=0_d17364114d-b3fce7c87d-181814149&amp;utm_content=buffer018f7&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer#sthash.ImfJ3C2p.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  facing cuts between 25 to 40% </a> , the good times are well and truly over for innovation types.</p><h3> Show Me The Data</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s time innovation and change demonstrates impact. Impact is the less sexy , geekier twin of Innovation &ndash; but they need each other to survive.</p><p> Today &ndash; it&rsquo;s the execution and impact of innovation and change that really matters. Not the relentless cheerleading.</p><p> <a href=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-05-at-20-35-30.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-11-05 at 20.35.30\" src=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-05-at-20-35-30.png?w=639\"/> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s a micro sample admittedly. But a quick Twitter poll shows over 80% of people feel there&rsquo;s room for improvement in how we evidence impact.</p><h3> Storytelling is great, but now is the time for evidence.</h3><p> <br/> Every change programme. Every organisation, lab, hub, funder and think tank must show:</p><li> <strong>  How we solve problems for people. </strong></li><li> <strong>  How we realise savings. </strong></li><li> <strong>  How we make the world a better place. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> We have a unique opportunity to demonstrate a new model of achieving change. We just need to prove it.</p>",

We know this is a sensitive topic but we request the option of wearing our own clothing rather than the company logo shirts. We thus kindly request that it not be mandatory to wear the company logo shirts as we think it&rsquo;ll hamper our confidence.</p><p> &mdash;&ndash;</p><h3> Dear Employee(s),</h3><p> I am excited to show you the new and improved company logo shirts I have ready to go. They are a fashion-forward marine blue I was able to purchase at a terrific bulk discount rate from USAACS &amp; Co, or as they&rsquo;re known in the fashion industry: USA Affordable Company Shirts. We&rsquo;re going to look like a cohesive team and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to impress everyone. Appreciate the feedback!</p><p> &mdash;&ndash;</p><h3> Why your plan will surely backfire</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a time and place for the company logo to shine (e.g., conventions where you have a booth). A company logoed shirt at a professional networking event can erase individuality and make someone feel like a dork, especially if everyone else is wearing their own, normal clothing.</p><p> &mdash;&ndash;</p><h3> Maybe try this instead:</h3><p> <br/> Save the company logoed shirts for when you need to especially stand out as a company representative, like behind a convention booth, or in the store, or if you are in door-to-door sales so the homeowner doesn&rsquo;t think you are there to murder them.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve never met an executive who said, &ldquo;My team&rsquo;s just too strategic. I just wish they would focus on the day-to-day work.&rdquo; Nope. In fact it&rsquo;s quite the opposite concern.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;How do I get my team to think more strategically?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Karin, I just don&rsquo;t think anyone on this team is ready to take on my role&hellip;. and I can&rsquo;t get promoted until I find a successor.&rdquo;</p><p> And the phone call of the week is, &ldquo;These millennials just don&rsquo;t seem to get it. There&rsquo;s no long-term commitment. I don&rsquo;t think they care.\"</p><p> I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and say, if your team is not thinking strategically don&rsquo;t write them off, until you take a good look at what you&rsquo;ve been sharing. It&rsquo;s impossible to connect the dots if you only see a third of them. If you wait until everything&rsquo;s fully baked to share it with the team, they&rsquo;ll never learn to be bakers.</p><p> <strong>  Not sure where to start without going out-of-bounds? Start here with these 7 strategic questions, that won&rsquo;t get you fired. </strong></p><h3> 1. Why do we do what we do? Note: &ldquo;to make money&rdquo; is not the only answer. Dig deeper.​</h3><p> I ask this question every time I go into a focus group. You would be surprised how few can articulate a compelling answer. Start here. Talk amongst yourselves. Challenge one another. I promise this is worth every minute of time spent not &ldquo;doing work.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. How does our team&rsquo;s work contribute to the company&rsquo;s mission?</h3><p> This one&rsquo;s more tricky. At the levels closest to the customer, it&rsquo;s easy to  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/energy-engagement/the-bot-syndrome-5-symptoms-which-indicate-your-employee-feels-like-a-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  feel like a bot </a> , and that&rsquo;s precisely where it&rsquo;s most dangerous.</p><h3> 3. What do our customers really want?</h3><p> Your team knows. Write it down, and then be sure your policies and procedures align.</p><h3> 4. Who are our major competitors and what differentiates us in the market?</h3><p> My guess is that some of your team will be all over this and others won&rsquo;t have a clue. Having the dialogue will offer great opportunites to explore perceptions and promote learning.</p><h3> 5. How does the way we do our work impact other departments?</h3><p> Some time spent here,  looking candidly from both directions, will save days (maybe weeks) of unproductive time.</p><h3> 6. How can we better articulate what we need to the departments we rely on?</h3><p> Make a short list and use it.</p><h3> 7. What&rsquo;s the most important thing we&rsquo;re working on and why?</h3><p> This one seems tricky, but it will open up a hornet&rsquo;s nest&hellip; so why do we?  Resist the urge to blame others for stupidity. If something really feels stupid, have the managerial courage to lift up the concern.</p><p> The best way to help your team to become more strategic, is to teach them to talk strategy. Imagine the possibilities if you were &ldquo;that guy.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Your turn. What are the strategic questions teams should be able to answer? </strong></p>",

    "title": "Proven Strategies to Attract and Retain Millennials",
    "link": "proven-strategies-to-attract-and-retain-millennials",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Millennials are the largest generation in the U.S., and more of them are entering the workforce every day &mdash; there&rsquo;s no avoiding them. This generation is hungry, impatient, and they&rsquo;ll turn your company upside down with their sense of rebellion &hellip; Or at least, that&rsquo;s the hype.</p><h3> <strong>  Millennials Definition </strong></h3><p> Born between 1980 and 2000, millennials grew up in a digital age with constant access to information. This upbringing shapes their perspective, and soon it&rsquo;s going to shape the workplace as a whole.</p><p> With over 80 million in the U.S. alone, this generation will take charge as a majority of the employee population before long.</p><h3> <strong>  Attract Millennials With Development </strong></h3><p> If you think millennials are driven by salary, think again. Organizations need to realize that money alone won&rsquo;t sway this generation to accept a job offer. In fact, a survey by  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.capstrat.com/elements/downloads/files/millennials-work.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cap Strat  </a> </u>  found that 72% of Gen Y are willing to sacrifice a higher salary for a more personally and professionally fulfilling career.</p><p> So if you want to attract millennials, you&rsquo;ll need to enhance their work experience beyond a paycheck. This is a generation that&rsquo;s always looking to learn. Check out what the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/BusinessEssentials/maximizing-millennials-in-the-workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kenan-Flagler Business School at UNC  </a> </u>  found out about millennials:</p><li> <strong>  Tuition reimbursement was a powerful attraction and retention tool for them </strong></li><li> <strong>  65% said the opportunity for personal development was the most influential factor for retention in their current job </strong></li><li> <strong>  22% saw training and development as the most valued benefit from any employer </strong></li><p> One of the most common characteristics from this generation is that they're looking to learn. And it&rsquo;s clear that they want to be in a company that will nurture their development. So take this to heart and find ways to help educate them and strengthen their skills:</p><p> <strong>  1. Classes </strong></p><p> Consider funding classes related to their field so they can gain more knowledge to support their position at work. Certain industries, such as finance, require exams in order to progress professionally. Covering these classes will help employees advance, especially if they&rsquo;re still in a junior-level position and don&rsquo;t have the funds for the courses.</p><p> <strong>  2. Seminars and conferences </strong></p><p> Digital marketing strategies. Latest trends in nanotechnology. Whatever industry you&rsquo;re in, there are tons of these events out there. Send employees to learn about specific topics from industry leaders and experts.</p><p> <strong>  3. Rotational programs </strong></p><p> Have employees spend a few months at a time in different sectors of the company. They&rsquo;ll learn valuable skills that they would not have gotten had they stayed in the same position for years.</p><p> <strong>  4. Training sessions </strong></p><p> Bring an instructor to the company. Not everyone can make time to take after-work classes, so having in-house sessions ensures all employees get the same training.</p><p> This affects how they decide which job to take, too. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/how-to-recruit-millennials-your-company-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kenan-Flagler Business School  </a> </u>  found that over half of millennials say that opportunities for career progression make an employer attractive.</p><p> Millennials expect swift career progression &mdash; along the lines of every 12 to 24 months, according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/09/12/millenials-will-soon-rule-the-world-but-how-will-they-lead/\" target=\"_blank\">   a recent Deloitte study  </a> </u> . So if you don&rsquo;t give them chances for professional development, you can count on a solid majority of them to have one foot out the door.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t forget, you benefit too. While millennials are building up their skills, you&rsquo;re getting a more engaged, highly trained workforce. Not a bad way to build up the strength of your team, is it?</p><h3> <strong>  Attract Them With a Fun Workplace </strong></h3><p> But also don&rsquo;t forget that work isn&rsquo;t all about producing. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-want-to-be-connected-to-their-coworkers-2013-6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PGi  </a> </u> , 88% of millennials are actively looking for a fun work environment. Think about ways you can help relieve the everyday stresses of work for employees and help them connect with their peers:</p><p> <strong>  1. Breaking bread </strong></p><p> Have lunch catered to the workplace and gather your team to sit and eat together. No one can say no to free food, and it provides a great opportunity for people to socialize and get to know their peers.</p><p> <strong>  2. Happy hour </strong></p><p> Having fun doesn&rsquo;t always have to take place in the workplace. Happy hours are a great chance for employees to unwind after work. And the change of scenery can make it more comfortable for people to start socializing.3</p><p> <strong>  3. Creative work </strong></p><p> Set aside some time or even a few days for employees to work on their own projects. Let them get creative! You&rsquo;ll be surprised at the ideas they come up with. And hey, it&rsquo;s a great way to inspire innovative ideas for the company.</p><p> Millennials aren&rsquo;t attracted to paychecks or ping-pong tables &mdash; they&rsquo;re drawn to simple perks that will develop them professionally and also let them have fun at work. Include these perks in your company, and you&rsquo;ll be able to easily reel in top talent.</p><h3> <strong>  Millennials Crave Collaboration </strong></h3><p> This generation grew up with collaboration and expects that in their workplace. It&rsquo;s time to think of redesigning your workplace to encourage brainstorming, teamwork, and creative thinking. And yes, that means saying &ldquo;rest in peace&rdquo; to cubicles.</p><p> The first step to indulging them is tearing down those cubes.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.knoll.com/media/878/738/OpenClosed_Offices_wp.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A study by Knoll  </a> </u>  found these advantages of moving from cubicles to an open floor plan:</p><li> <strong>  Performance increased by an average of 440% </strong></li><li> <strong>  There was a 5.5% reduction in business process time and cost </strong></li><p> Walls are an obstacle for communication, so don&rsquo;t keep them up. Instead, try grouping desks together or creating rows where employees can face each other. Whatever your decision, make sure your workers can talk to their colleagues without having to shout or move too far.</p><p> Of course, getting rid of walls was step one. The second step is to create spaces for collaboration. While meeting rooms are ideal, they&rsquo;re not always readily available. Here are some ideas for informal and formal meeting spaces:</p><p> <strong>  1. Meeting tables </strong></p><p> Scatter tables around the office where employees can quickly come together. Put up a whiteboard on the wall, and you&rsquo;ve got a faux meeting room. Having these tables promotes and encourages spontaneous ideation.</p><p> <strong>  2. Break rooms </strong></p><p> Draw employees from their desks by giving them a space where they can interact spontaneously. Idle chitchat around the watercooler mainly revolves around work-related subjects, and you never know when a brilliant idea might pop up.</p><p> <strong>  3. Formal meeting rooms </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget to still have rooms that can be scheduled. Having enclosed rooms is great for sensitive topics or when you need to gather a large party.</p><p> According to an  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.samclar.com/sitefiles/files/IdeaPaint-2013-Millennial-Survey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IdeaPaint survey  </a> </u> , millennials reported that only 30.8% of their ideation meetings are planned. So make sure your workplace has designated spaces where employees can quickly gather.</p><h3> <strong>  Managing Millennials in the Workplace </strong></h3><p> Millennials&rsquo; wants and needs are creating a seismic shift in the workplace. And if you&rsquo;re not ready to adjust your workplace and management style, then there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re going to keep this well-educated workforce around at your organization. Here are seven tips for managing millennials the right way:</p><p> <strong>  1. Experiment with responsibilities </strong></p><p> Millennials dream big &mdash; they just don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;ll get there or what they&rsquo;re best at. So let them take a shot at different responsibilities so they can find out where they true passion lies. Who knows, someone who wanted to do graphic designing might be better off as a production artist.</p><p> <strong>  2. Try &ldquo;reverse mentoring&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Sure, as a manager you have many more years of experience than a Gen Yer. But they have plenty to teach you. Leverage their knowledge of technology and have them assist you with social media or online collaboration.</p><p> <strong>  3. Give purpose, not perks </strong></p><p> Free this, free that &mdash; companies are using trendy perks to reel people in. But really, millennials want a sense of purpose at their job. Give them opportunities to volunteer and develop within your organization so they know they&rsquo;re doing more than just pounding the keyboard.</p><p> <strong>  4. Communicate everything </strong></p><p> This generation grew up in a very supportive and reassuring environment. And as a result, they need to know about everything &mdash; right away. Have regular one-on-one meetings, provide feedback, and give them recognition. Make sure you&rsquo;re transparent with information.</p><p> <strong>  5. Be patient </strong></p><p> Remember, this young crowd is new to the professional world. They might now have all of the soft skills down, but they&rsquo;re ready and willing to learn. Give them time and guidance to absorb the new information, and soon they&rsquo;ll thrive at your workplace.</p><p> <strong>  6. Focus on results, not hours </strong></p><p> Millennials don&rsquo;t see a point in being forced to stay at the office from 9 to 5. So let them go home after they&rsquo;re done with their daily tasks. There are no financial or real benefits for the organization if their brain is fried from a day&rsquo;s work, and they&rsquo;re only sticking around to kill hours.</p><p> <strong>  7. Give them a &ldquo;why&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Want to make company changes? Or maybe you want to reinforce certain behaviors? Give them a reason, and of course, that reason should be tied to your organization&rsquo;s values.</p><p> Managing millennials in the workplace might be intimidating because of all the rumors you&rsquo;ve heard about them. But they&rsquo;re actually an easy bunch to please. Just give them some guidance, help them grow, and communicate to keep them satisfied on the job.</p><h3> <strong>  They Need Feedback </strong></h3><p> Unlike their older counterparts who are comfortable letting months go by without feedback, this generation wants it right away. Maybe it&rsquo;s their deep, intrinsic drive to get ahead and make real contributions. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because they grew up with helicopter parents. Whatever the case, millennials in the workplace are hooked on feedback.</p><p> Older generations think this young crowd expects themselves to get ahead before they&rsquo;re even ready. However, millennials themselves have a different take on it all. For them, it&rsquo;s about having an impact on the company and knowing that they&rsquo;re doing it in the right way. A study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.viacom.com/2012/10/consumer-insights-mtvs-no-collar-workers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Viacom  </a> </u>  found that:</p><li> <strong>  8 out of 10 want regular feedback on their performance </strong></li><p> Like it or not, millennials are hungry for feedback. It&rsquo;s not just about boosting their ego or receiving a pat on the back. It&rsquo;s about making sure that at work, they&rsquo;re the best they can be.</p><p> As juvenile as it seems, millennials want you to hold their hand. Yes, they&rsquo;re well educated, but they also lack a lot of professional skills due to their inexperience in the working world. Going back to the Viacom study:</p><li> <strong>  61% of millennials say they need specific directions in order to do their best work </strong></li><li> <strong>  Two-thirds of them want to be included in a mentorship program </strong></li><p> Simply put, Gen Y is career driven. They want to make sure they are headed in the right direction. Because in reality, we don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re actually doing something the wrong way until an outsider points it out.</p><p> With personal growth at such a prominent position on their workplace wish list, it&rsquo;s easy to see why these factors contribute to their decision to stay or go.</p><h3> <strong>  They Want to Lead </strong></h3><p> Are you looking to your millennial talent base for your next leaders? If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re missing out. Not nearly enough companies are investing the time and energy into bringing Gen Y into leadership positions. That&rsquo;s a mistake.</p><p> Look at the mismatch that  <u>  <a href=\"http://dupress.com/articles/developing-leaders-perennial-issue-human-capital-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Deloitte  </a>  &rsquo;s </u> and  <u>  Virtuali&rsquo;s </u> findings show:</p><li> <strong>  Only 28% of millennials believe their current company is making full use of their skills </strong></li><li> <strong>  Only 6% of companies report they have &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; programs to develop this generation </strong></li><li> <strong>  However, 53% of these young employees aspire to leadership positions in their current organization </strong></li><li> <strong>  95% of them believe it&rsquo;s important for companies to offer leadership development activities </strong></li><p> Companies are failing their employees &mdash; their millennial workforce is more than willing to put in the time and effort to train and develop their skills to become leaders. We need to be doing much better in supporting their careers, because it&rsquo;s a win-win situation: offering leadership opportunities will engage them, meaning you&rsquo;ll have far less turnover.</p><p> <strong>  1. Definition of leadership </strong></p><p> The #FOMO, or fear of missing out, culture means that this generation is chasing the next great experience. In fact, according to the Virtuali study, 78% of them say they value experience over possessions. You as a company need to give them those experiences. This means instead of boosting salary, boost their exciting opportunities. They want to build relationships, take on a driving force in innovative projects, and interact with customers or other employee teams, depending on the nature of your business.</p><p> <strong>  2. The training method </strong></p><p> Take a two-pronged approach: experience based and individualized. Gen Y respondents to the Virtuali study reported that they thought the leadership training was inadequate, and that it placed too much emphasis on e-learning instead of on actual on-the-job experiences. Look back at what these young employees think leadership means and attack training from that perspective. There should be job rotations, shadowing, externships, special job assignments, and helming new projects.</p><p> <strong>  3. Valuable training </strong></p><p> One of the most highly sought-after opportunities for them is the opportunity to work abroad. Global business environments should capitalize on this to engage future leaders of their company. In the Virtuali study, 87% of millennial respondents reported that the opportunity to work abroad would increase their desire to join a company, 80% would be highly engaged, and 81% said it would make them want to remain at their company. Don&rsquo;t miss out on this opportunity if it&rsquo;s available to your company.</p><p> This generation is the future of companies. Invest in their leadership training with on-the-job experiences and you&rsquo;ll win their loyalty.</p><h3> <strong>  Be Socially Responsible </strong></h3><p> 78% of millennials think companies have an obligation to be socially responsible, according to  <a href=\"http://download.2164.net/PDF-newsletters/2006MillennialCause.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this study by Cone Communications </a> . This socially conscious generation isn&rsquo;t going to leave saving the world to big charities. They&rsquo;re going to do it themselves &mdash; and they expect you to join them. And whether a company lives up to it or not is a big factor in where these respondents choose to work.</p><li> <strong>  79% want to work for a company that cares about its impact on society </strong></li><li> <strong>  Nearly two-thirds say their company&rsquo;s contributions to society make them loyal </strong></li><p> Companies worry about how to retain employees, especially those from this generation. These responses send a clear message about what the answer is for a sizeable majority. There&rsquo;s passion behind these answers, and a company that knows how to leverage it will be rewarded with passionate employees.</p><p> <strong>  1. Give more </strong></p><p> According to the Cone study, 70% of millennials think companies aren&rsquo;t doing enough. They can&rsquo;t really be blamed for their opinion. For instance, when it comes to charitable donations,  <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/08/corporations_don_t_give_to_charity_why_the_most_profitable_companies_are.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  corporations aren&rsquo;t giving as much as they used to </a> . Since 1986, the percent of profits being donated has dropped from 2.1% to 0.8%. And sure, the total dollar amount of donations has gone up &mdash; but ultimately corporations are dishing out a smaller and smaller piece of their overall pie. This isn&rsquo;t living the mission the way that Gen Y wants.</p><p> <strong>  2. Tapping into the energy </strong></p><p> The rewards of engaging millennials can be huge, and not just during the employee&rsquo;s workday. There&rsquo;s a particular group, which the Cone study calls the &ldquo;Doers,&rdquo; with strong participation in social activism. These Doers are particularly invested in their causes, to the point where 68% would refuse to work for a socially irresponsible employer.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no doubt that this generation has high expectations. But companies that take social responsibility seriously can win their loyalty and support, as both employees and consumers.</p><p> In actuallity, the expectations that millennials are looking for in the workplace aren't completely absurd. Development, feedback, recognition &mdash; these are all things that workers from any generation can enjoy. So if you implement these changes, you'll be creating an engaging environment not just for millennials but all employees.</p><h3> <strong>  Share Your Experience </strong></h3><p> Who doesn't have a millennial coworker? What has your experience been like working with them? Or maybe you're a millennial yourself &mdash; what stereotypes do you think are plaguing the millennial name?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanburkeh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sean Burke  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.kitedesk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   KiteDesk  </u> </a></p><h3> Do you ever wonder what your CEO is thinking? Does she like you? Does he think you are doing a great job or are you just &ldquo;meh&rdquo;?  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve at least thought about it.</h3><p> <br/> Obviously, not all CEOs are the same. Some are quiet and analytical, others are gregarious and the ultimate company cheerleader, and some are just plain (cough) jerks.</p><p> For most companies, having a talented team is the No. 1 priority for a CEO. You think it&rsquo;s about vision and strategy, but you have to get the right people first. &ndash; Andrean Jung, Grameen America</p><p> No matter what their style, there are (3) things that CEOs want to see in each of their team members. In order to put your best foot forward you should show your CEO that:</p><h3> <strong>  #1. You are committed. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The smaller the company, the more you need to be committed to the cause and the mission of the business. Leaders want to know that you are thinking and acting like an owner. They want to see and feel you trying your best to solve problems and accomplish goals.</p><p> &ldquo;Employee engagement is the emotional commitment the employee has to the organization and its goals. This emotional commitment means engaged employees actually care about their work and their company. They don&rsquo;t work just for a paycheck, or just for the next promotion, but work on behalf of the organization&rsquo;s goals.&rdquo; &ndash; Kevin Kruse </p><p> Why is this important to the CEO? Business is much like a never-ending war. Every quarter you go out for battle and at 12:00 a.m. on the last day of that quarter, you clean up your uniforms, put them back on, and start all over.</p><p> CEOs know that the smartest, or even the most skilled, teams often don&rsquo;t win. Many times, the victor is the team with the most commitment. As he or she is walking the halls of your office, they are looking to see that each employee is in the battle, fighting with all their might. The CEO needs your commitment &ndash; it is essential for the company&rsquo;s survival &ndash; so of course it will be top of mind for them.</p><p> Companies with engaged employees, outperform those without by 202% (Source: Dale Carnegie)</p><p> How to show your commitment: First of all, if you are not committed to your company&rsquo;s cause &ndash; leave. Leave as fast as you can. It&rsquo;s good for neither you, nor for everyone else with whom you work. </p><p> If you are committed, here are a few tips to genuinely express it:</p><li> <strong>  ALWAYS make eye contact with your executive leadership. </strong> With your expression let the CEO know that you are ALL IN. When you are in a group meeting do the same. Be present &ndash; don&rsquo;t stick your face into your mobile phone.</li><li> <strong>  Attend your company events. </strong> Be in the pictures. Wear your company colors. Fly the company flag.</li><li> <strong>  Do what others will not. </strong> Help clean up after a company event. Know your mission and company values. Join a company committee. Give feedback. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Work harder than everyone else. I know this may be pass&eacute;, but the best way to show your commitment is to work your butt off. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  #2. You can be trusted to &ldquo;Handle It.&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Trust is probably the most important thing that Executives want from their team. There are thousands of decisions and actions that take place in a business, daily. Your CEO needs to trust that your part of the business is handled.</p><p> My three favorite words are: I&rsquo;ll handle it. And, when I trust that theperson will actually do that &ndash; that is joyful!</p><p> Why is this important to the CEO?  A recurring dream of many business leaders is that the company is achieving its goals, its people are happy, its investors are thrilled, it has no legal issues, it&rsquo;s ahead of its competition and that there isn&rsquo;t someone waiting outside their door waiting to drop a bombshell on them that puts everything into chaos mode.</p><p> This is a dream for a reason, because things are rarely ever in harmony as I described earlier.   So, by you handling your part of the business, it allows the CEO to focus on other areas of the business that aren&rsquo;t operating effectively.</p><p> How can you show that you can handle it? I&rsquo;m going to share with you some tips below. Before I do, I want you to take a minute to imagine yourself as your CEO. Picture yourself in her position, seated across from you, preparing for a discussion on your performance. Think of your responsibility and performance in the context of how he or she may see it.</p><p> With that in mind, here are some tips:</p><li> <strong>  When you commit to delivering something that will be seen by the CEO, make sure that: </strong> <li>  You complete it early and have it vetted by others to ensure that it is up to par. NEVER make a CEO ask you a second time for something &ndash; No, No, never! </li> <li>  It is 100% accurate. ZERO errors of any kind. </li> <li>  Make sure that the document/dashboard/etc. does not require guidance to read. </li></li><li> <strong>  Within your department, solve problems; don&rsquo;t be the problem (duh &ndash; I know). </strong></li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t say yes to a timeline or commitment until you scope it out and are sure you can deliver. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Make sure that your role has clearly defined goals (measurable goals) &ndash; and make sure you hit them &ndash; every single time. Predictable performance is better than roller coaster performance.</p><h3> <strong>  #3. You are not all about you. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I might be a tad unusual in this &ldquo;want,&rdquo; but personally, any team member of KiteDesk who puts their wants higher than that of the company&rsquo;s &ndash; then they aren&rsquo;t right for us. This is as much about culture as anything else I have written about.</p><p> Why is this important to the CEO? First, building a company where people trust one another and show each other respect needs to have a foundation that is built on the belief that we are doing this together.</p><p> Self-centered, &ldquo;me vs. we&rdquo; team members erode the trust that is necessary to make the fight worth fighting for.</p><p> I also have experienced that people who put their own wants above others tend to jump around. The next company who will bend to their wishes or be wowed by their talent will do whatever it takes to hire them. This same company will regret that decision the day that person walks out the door for the next sucker that is willing to show preferential treatment to one person.</p><p> How can you show that you are a &ldquo;we&rdquo; person? Well first, you have to be one &ndash; that is the cost of entry. So assuming that you do put the company&rsquo;s needs first then, here are some tips:</p><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t ask what you can do to help </strong> &ndash; just help. Find areas within the business that you can assist and offer your time and expertise.</li><li> <strong>  Consider other people&rsquo;s vantage point before you react. </strong> Think of the greater good when dealing with issues.</li><li> <strong>  Be humble </strong> &ndash; give credit vs. taking it. Be gracious.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t ask for, or expect, special treatment. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> I realize that many company cultures would not support what I am saying. Which is fine &ndash; thank God I am not a part of them </p><p> As an acting CEO, I love to see  <u>  my team (our team) </u>  enjoying our work. It&rsquo;s fulfilling to see how proud they are of their accomplishments. It&rsquo;s encouraging to witness them working together to solve problems and taking ownership for their contributions. I&rsquo;m so fortunate to work with a group of people that are driven to help salespeople drive results they never thought possible.</p><p> If you have any questions about &ldquo;The CEO Mind&rdquo; &mdash; connect with me on LinkedIn &ndash; I&rsquo;ll do my best to respond to your questions.</p>",

Client demand at 58%.</li><li> What is the Number 1 factor that surveyed financial advisors say keeps them from getting involved in impact investing? &ldquo;Lack of information/familiarity&rdquo; at 77%.</li>Commenting on the survey findings, First Affirmative Financial Network President, Steve Schueth, said:  &ldquo;The survey&rsquo;s findings show that the financial world is adjusting quickly to accommodate retail investor demand for impact investing. It is encouraging to see so many so-called &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; financial advisors embrace the notion that their clients can do well and do good at the same time. Only a few years ago investing for impact was the exclusive province of investment professionals who specialized in SRI&mdash;Sustainable, Responsible, Impact investing. The reason for this encouraging trend is pretty clear: A new generation of Millennials, women, and college-educated investors are demanding positively impactful investment strategies.&rdquo; (see graph below)<img alt=\"Millenials\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-28-11_17_14-Millenials.png-721&times;162.png\"/> ",

The important thing to remember is &ndash; that&rsquo;s OK!</h3><p> <br/> The important thing to find out is why!  Always welcome an objection &ndash; it&rsquo;s a chance to set your customers mind at ease about something that is bothering them.</p><p> Once we know this we can see what kind of a &lsquo;no&rsquo; it is.</p><p> A &lsquo;No, convince me&rsquo;, &lsquo;No, not now&rsquo; or a &lsquo;No, never darken my doorstep again&rsquo;.  The third kind rarely if ever happen &ndash; but as a salesperson you sometimes think this IS what you are hearing.</p><h3> Types of Objection</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Price </strong></p><p> Is it really a price objection? Or is it really value?  You need to drill into this objection and find out more &ndash; often its masking a different reason, and if they really have a price option can you do something around payment terms or offer them a cut down product?</p><p> <strong>  Competitor </strong></p><p> Do you know your competitors?  If you don&rsquo;t then you really should &ndash; and you should know how to present yourself in the best light in the context of them as a competitor.  My hot tip?  DON&rsquo;T sell against them (i.e. &lsquo;oh you don&rsquo;t want to go with them, I had a customer do that and it was terrible because&hellip;&rsquo;) &ndash; you will only alienate them. But DO push your strengths &ndash; e.g. &lsquo;where we really excel is our after sales &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got some great testimonials from customers&rsquo;</p><p> <strong>  The Status Quo </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s hard to change &ndash; so how are you going to do it?  It takes time and that is often something people are very short of, but to have got to the point of closing on a product you must have had some initial buy in &ndash; so think about how you can minimise the work the customer has to do &ndash; can you deliver the change for them as well by project managing, showing a planned approach or picking up for the customer?</p><p> <strong>  Prospect &lsquo;goes dark&rsquo; </strong></p><p> So your prospect has stopped taking your calls, is not responding to your emails and you are reduced to internet stalking them to try and &lsquo;run into them&rsquo; at a networking event.  You need to regain control of the situation &ndash; and if they are no longer talking to you its hard to do&hellip; my top tip is to never get into this situation (ask me if you want to know how to avoid it!) &ndash; but once you are there are only a couple of ways back.  Firstly try to offer some value &ndash; can you email them a white paper or industry document that they might find useful which they then feel obliged to thank you for?  Alternatively you could invite them to an event they might enjoy or as a last attempt try and catch their attention with a card or letter in the post.  There are also some innovative ideas you can use at this point if you have the nerve &ndash; send flowers of a sachet of coffee and suggest a catch up!  Raising a smile always increases your chances of success.</p><p> So objections are just part of our buying process &ndash; welcome them and take it as an opportunity.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Due to the incredible nature of my work, I&rsquo;m able to work from home or on the road. And I planned it that way.</h3><p> <br/> I still remember my first airplane ride &ndash; looking down and realizing that I wanted to have the freedom to travel as an adult.</p><p> But unless I was prepared to become an airline stewardess (not such a bad idea) or a travel writer (life reserves special places for those people), there were limited ways for me to make my dream of travel come true.</p><p> Enter social media in 2009. Much love and thanks to a professor who told us the first day of class to &ldquo;get a Twitter,&rdquo; which I did that very evening!</p><p> By the time I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill&rsquo;s School of Mass Communication and Journalism, I had landed two excellent (one paid) internships managing social media and was addicted.</p><p> All of a sudden, I saw the heavens open and the path to working from anywhere IF I could create a successful social media business. Within 6 months of graduating, I had launched my business.</p><p> That was over three years ago, and I&rsquo;m still going strong.</p><p> Besides the typical social media questions, one of the most asked is how I maintain focus on the road or working from home, and it&rsquo;s a great question!</p><p> Many people see the lure of working from home/on the road and run towards that dream without understanding what it takes to do it. I was certainly one of those people. I&rsquo;ve failed many times, been crazy broke, went door-to-door looking for business, but have become adept at doing what I do very well.</p><p> I tell you all of this because when I give you insights into how to maintain this kind of lifestyle, it&rsquo;s important you know that it&rsquo;s coming from someone who does it everyday.</p><p> These are my tips on how to be successful working from home or on the road.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Take care of your body, mind, and spirit. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If there was anything I&rsquo;d say is 100% necessary to being an entrepreneur &ndash; it&rsquo;s the care of yourself.</p><p> When I first started my business it was easy to lose myself in work for days on end, and that pace landed me in my first &ldquo;burn out&rdquo; period. If you haven&rsquo;t ever experienced this, it&rsquo;s somewhat akin to a MAJOR hangover where your brain simply won&rsquo;t turn on and everything is fuzzy.</p><p> As I was lost in the haze, it dawned on me that I had been working non-stop for almost 3 weeks without one day off, sun up to sun down &ndash; and that wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it.</p><p> But of course once you become the sole factor to making money, it&rsquo;s tough to turn off. However, it&rsquo;s necessary to the growth and productivity of your business.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t learn how to take care of yourself in the early stages of your business, it will become harder and harder to break those habits of wondering back to your computer after work time or working on an off day.</p><p> So what does taking care of your mind and body look like?</p><li> <strong>  It means getting the appropriate amount of sleep every night. </strong> Some folks don&rsquo;t need as much sleep as others, but sleep is critical for me. I traded late night fun for feeling fabulous early in the morning a long time ago. You can&rsquo;t be a party animal or stay up all hours of the night and expect your body to perform day after day.</li><li> <strong>  It also means exercising your body on a daily basis. </strong> That exercise can be whatever you want it to be, but I suggest doing something that takes you out of the house, away from electronics (yes, leave your phone), and gets your heart rate elevated. For me, I like to start out my day with walking/hiking/running outside. Being outside calms my mind and offers some of the most creative time I&rsquo;ll have all day. I like to end my day with yoga and/or have it scheduled out somewhere in the evening. It releases the stress from the day, and has made a MAJOR impact on my sleeping schedule, which was almost non-existent before finding yoga.</li><li> <strong>  Eating healthy food. </strong> This one might make you roll your eyes, but when you become your own boss, no one is going to take care of the business when you&rsquo;re sick or not feeling well. So ensuring that your machine (you) is running at optimal level is key, and what we eat plays a vital role in that health. These days, I don&rsquo;t eat for pleasure as much as eating to fuel my body.</li><li> <strong>  Find a spiritual outlet. </strong> I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to believe or spend your energy on, but having a spiritual place to go when things get tough or something to rely on will help in the chaos of life. For some people, this is infused through volunteer work, and for others it&rsquo;s praying to the god of their choice. Whatever it is, make sure it feeds your soul because money never will, and at some point, you&rsquo;re going to start asking what all this entrepreneur madness is about. <br/>  </li><p> Bottom line, if you don&rsquo;t take proper care of yourself, it&rsquo;s going to greatly impede your progress. And I can promise you that if you don&rsquo;t slow yourself down then your body will do it for you with sickness, aches, sleepiness, disease, etc.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t mess around with your health.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Build a routine. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Routines are pretty unsexy, but very necessary to being successful with working at home or on the road.</p><p> My day starts out with a very specific routine: coffee/reading (usually the Bible or a devotional book), journaling, prayer, and exercise.</p><p> Without this morning routine, I&rsquo;m off all day. It centers me from the very beginning and offers me a place to start, and if you know anything about starting &ndash; it needs to go well because it affects the path of the day.</p><p> Past my morning routine, I have routines of when I like to eat, take breaks, and shut down my day.</p><p> These are crucial because if you want to change up your environment, you&rsquo;re going to need something that makes you feel stable regardless of where you are.</p><p> Which brings me to adaptability.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Learn how to adapt. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you can&rsquo;t adapt quickly, then being an entrepreneur is going to be very tough, and quite frankly &ndash; you probably won&rsquo;t make it.</p><p> Being adaptable means being able to go with the flow, change up according to what happens in your day or what might pop up, and believe me &ndash; MUCH will pop up.</p><p> When I&rsquo;m on the road working for a client, I have to be able to adapt my morning routine to my traveling schedule, which means I may not always be able to work out, journal or have coffee. Praying is a non-negotiable for me, but that can be done anywhere and at anytime.</p><p> And that doesn&rsquo;t just apply to life on the road. You never know when the internet will go down or someone randomly stops by or the electricity goes out.</p><p> Life happens, and you&rsquo;ve got to be able to deal with it positively.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Establish a place in your home/hotel to work. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Environment is key to being able to get down and productive. That means finding a place in your home or naming a spot in your hotel where work will be done.</p><p> Now the key to this is making sure nothing else happens in these places. Don&rsquo;t hang out there for fun or even eat there (more on that in a minute).</p><p> If you can be precious about what that area is for then your mind will acclimate when it sits down, and you&rsquo;ll be able to get in work mode super fast.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Do not eat at your desk. Ever. Like, seriously. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I call it the new entrepreneur 15, and it&rsquo;s no joke, especially among my female entrepreneur friends.</p><p> When you eat in front of your computer or laptop, you&rsquo;re starting a very bad habit that will be harmful to taking care of yourself. Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p><li> You won&rsquo;t be paying attention to how much you eat because you&rsquo;ll be perusing online</li><li> You&rsquo;ll start bringing all kinds of snacks in front of your computer at all times</li><li> You&rsquo;ll get to the point where you can&rsquo;t get in work mode unless you&rsquo;ve got a snack</li><li> You won&rsquo;t take much needed breaks from your computer</li><li> Your clothes will stop fitting, you&rsquo;ll feel sluggish/sleepy, and productivity will dive</li><p> <br/> How do I know this? Because I&rsquo;ve lived it, and constantly have to remind myself that I must keep eating away from my computer. It&rsquo;s not easy, but it&rsquo;s necessary.</p><p> Eat your food in another room if possible or in a quiet place, so your brain can reinvigorate itself. Take advantage of that break!</p><p> And if you&rsquo;re on the road and have your computer with you &ndash; keep it closed until after you&rsquo;ve eaten.</p><p> Always separate eating time with working time.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Find a local community for interaction/work environment. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let me be straight &ndash; it&rsquo;s HELLA hard to be an entrepreneur! But I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. However, it does lead to a lot of loneliness, isolation, anxiety, and depression.</p><p> But that can be greatly alleviated by getting involved with a local entrepreneur group or finding a work atmosphere to go to a few days a week outside of the house (cafe or work space).</p><p> We need to be around people &ndash; we are a human race that withers away in isolation, and it&rsquo;s important that we have people who understand our way of living and can relate to the hard times.</p><p> By biggest issue with this &ldquo;work from anywhere&rdquo; trend that&rsquo;s exploding is how little entrepreneurs discuss the hard times of doing what we do. When we are always focusing on the wins, it&rsquo;s not realistic to those who are trying to establish themselves as entrepreneurs, and then they think they&rsquo;ll failing because they&rsquo;re dealing with major emotional issues.</p><p> Being an entrepreneur is hard because we can&rsquo;t count on anyone but ourselves to cheerlead us along (loved ones do their best, but we are ultimately responsible for that), self-motivation can be fleeting, and success isn&rsquo;t easily defined.</p><p> Bottom line &ndash; surround yourself with people who understand what you&rsquo;re going through because they&rsquo;re doing it themselves. This point really falls into #1 because it assists us in growing mentally strong.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Create systems for your work flow. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m a major systems person. I color code like a freak, and have to have everything laid out plainly for me to view.</p><p> But that doesn&rsquo;t always mean I&rsquo;m effective with my systems. Yet they are crucial to my routine and ability to adapt.</p><p> For instance, my agency work flows and outlines are lodged on Google Drive. That&rsquo;s because I need to be able to access them anywhere, regardless of if I lose a laptop while on the road or something worse happens. Without systems, we can&rsquo;t adapt as efficiently.</p><p> My main systems have to do with work flows and social strategies because that&rsquo;s the nature of my business. But mainly, they&rsquo;re there to organize my business and save time.</p><p> Time is the most valuable asset we have and without systems to streamline what we do every day, we will lose precious time.</p><p> This is especially important while on the road because if you&rsquo;re at the beach, you want to work effectively and quickly, so you can put on that bathing suit and go jump in the water. Or if you&rsquo;re at home, you want to be able to enjoy your loved ones.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Update your systems quarterly. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Speaking of systems, it&rsquo;s important to constantly update what&rsquo;s in place because your business will constantly change.</p><p> I update my processes on a quarterly basis because that gives me enough time to see if a process is truly effective, and evaluate new tools or variables that will affect the systems. In addition, it correlates to the flow of business change.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t just think of this in terms of your business work flows &ndash; continually update how you eat, how you exercise or routines that are in place.</p><p> If we don&rsquo;t innovate, we die, and innovation comes through updates in all areas of our lives.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Write out to-do&rsquo;s the night before bed time. </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is a major one &ndash; plan the next day the night before.</p><p> The last thing I do before leaving my desk is plan out my next day. This allows me to list out everything that needs to be done the next day.</p><p> It allows me to sleep better, and enjoy my morning time more because I know what&rsquo;s on the way.</p><p> Bottom line, it allows me to take better care of myself, and helps me to be super productive whether I&rsquo;m sitting down at my desk or hotel station.</p><h3> 10. Get comfortable with lists.</h3><p> <br/> Lists &ndash; ugh you say. Or you&rsquo;re like me, and you rejoice!</p><p> Lists can be the bane of your existence, but they should be your best friend. Now remember when we discussed adaptability? That habit needs to be adapted to lists because if you get in the habit of making lists, it&rsquo;s important to not become slaves to them.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p><li> <strong>  Make a to-do list every night of what MUST be done the next day. </strong> These are non-negotiable, and include personal items, i.e. yoga at 6pm, etc.</li><li> <strong>  Make a list of things you&rsquo;d like to do the next day. </strong> These are items that can be tackled once your MUST do list is completed. Some days I don&rsquo;t get to this list, so the items are pushed to the next day.</li><li> <strong>  Make a list of dream items. </strong> These lists (there can be multiple) have to do with whatever you want to do and/or need to do at some point in the future. Maybe they contain things like: redesign the website, switch email providers, etc. The point is to have a list that keeps things that are important, but don&rsquo;t have expiration dates. By writing them down we will find ourselves unconsciously opening up time to complete them. <br/>  </li><p> Lists are a valuable tool when you&rsquo;re on the road and/or changing up environments rapidly. They&rsquo;ll help you feel grounded and stay productive.</p><h3> <strong>  11. Learn how to brain dump. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Have you ever heard of brain dumping? It&rsquo;s huge. And very important.</p><p> Whenever you get overwhelmed with everything you have to do &ndash; do a brain dump. It means sitting down, preferably without electronics, i.e. a pen and paper, and writing down everythinggggggg you need to do.</p><p> Once you do that, cross out everything that doesn&rsquo;t have an immediate need to compete.</p><p> Why is this important?</p><li> <strong>  It will alleviate a LOT of stress </strong></li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s a great way to get an overview of everything you have going on </strong></li><li> <strong>  It will allow you to re-evaluate what&rsquo;s really important </strong></li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s an excellent habit </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Brain dumping is something that should be done regularly and will assist in keeping your mind open and calm for whatever comes your way.</p><h3> <strong>  Overview: </strong></h3><p> <br/> I could continue adding to this list because there&rsquo;s so many things that are important to have a successful business at home or on the road, but I&rsquo;ll stop here and possibly do a second installment.</p><p> But what am I missing? How do YOU make working at home or on the road successful??</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Surya Pisapati | Spouting Rock Financial</p><h3> In light of the recent market volatility, investors have looked to Liquid Alternatives as a source of diversification and tail risk protection.  Liquid Alternatives were touted as having &ldquo;done their job&rdquo; in the context of asset allocation, as they generated lower downside capture to the broader equity markets.</h3><p> <br/> As one digs deeper into the constituents of the Liquid Alternative market, the differentiation between various sub-strategies comes to the fore.  In order to understand this differentiation we have looked at the performance of the Morningstar alternative sub-categories, including the Nontraditional bond category, over the August/September 2015 drawdown and the subsequent run-up during October.  Drawdown period refers to peak-to-trough movement of S&amp;P 500 starting from August 17 to September 27 during which it lost 7.44%.  Run-up period refers to the recovery from trough starting September 28 through October 31 during which S&amp;P 500 was up 7.85%.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-08-at-7.32.08-PM.png\" width=\"396\"/></p><p> Long/Short equity funds in general tend to have a higher correlation to the S&amp;P 500 compared to other sub-categories.  This was proven to be the case during the period under observation as well, as these funds captured more of the market downside than any other category.  On the flip side, they also captured the highest percentage of the ensuing recovery, while the dispersion within the group is evident from the 2.23% maximum return and -25.72% minimum return during the drawdown period.  This highlights the importance of thorough due-diligence in manager selection when allocating to managers within this group.  In other words, understanding the risks that are driving the returns for a particular strategy helps form return expectations during various market scenarios, be it a bull, bear or sideways market.</p><p> The other sub-categories have generated returns in line with expectations during both the periods; i.e., average and median returns show a lower capture ratio on the downside as well as on the upside, supporting the lower correlation benefits touted by these strategies.   </p><p> <strong>  In conclusion, Liquid Alternatives have been able to deliver the expected performance over the recent drawdown and run up.  </strong> However, the underlying dispersion between various sub-strategies in terms of the average return as well as the maximum and minimum returns has demonstrated the need for active due-diligence and monitoring by investors across their portfolios.</p>",

    "link": "before-you-say-i-do-consider-these-conversations",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Couples are just trying to get it right. They want to stay connected, approach their relationship with effort and intention, create conversations, and build and maintain a happy relationship.</h3><p> <br/> But we all know that happily ever after doesn't happen for everyone.</p><p> As a marriage/relationship therapist, I not only see married couples, but couples who are engaged or coupled up - those who are in a relationship but have yet to take the next step. Either way, they want couples/premarital counseling to address their issues and ensure a strong and healthy relationship.</p><h3> Unmarried couples seek out couples counseling for two predominant reasons.</h3><p> <br/> One, they have a few issues they cannot resolve and before they get mar ried, they want to work through them. Two, they are in a good place and despite some minor differences they want to insure that their marriage starts out strong.  They want to know and feel that before they take the proverbial 'walk down the aisle', they are on the same page and their pesky little issues don't become bigger issues that wreak havoc and end their marriage or relationship.</p><p> Yet, despite the benefits of premarital counseling, many couples are busy planning their wedding and premarital counseling is the very last thing on their mind - even if there are problems. Issues are often ignored and they figure, 'we will work them out later.' They don't want their happiness diluted through couples counseling! And let's not forget, there are many couples who do not have issues (that are causing problems) and are simply in a great place!</p><p> So, I  am not here to change your mind but to simply share some of the important and necessary conversations that couples should have before they say 'I Do', rather than waiting (like MANY do) until they are married, years pass, and discord and strife takes over a once happy couple.</p><h3> 1.) Communication styles.</h3><p> Are you a distancer or a pursuer? Do you lean in towards conflict (this is not about being confrontative &ndash; big difference!) or go running for the hills and avoid conflict? <a href=\"http://www.gottman.com/about-us-2/dr-john-gottman/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  John Gottman </a>  believes that the tendency of men to withdraw and women to pursue is wired into our physiology and reflects a basic gender difference. He notes that this pattern is extremely common and is a major contributor to marital breakdown. Communication problems are the number one complaint expressed by couples.</p><h3> 2.) Sex. Yep, we HAVE to talk about sex.</h3><p> It&rsquo;s an integral component of a relationship and its health. It&rsquo;s the barometer of the relationship. Did you talk about sex in your household growing up? Was it taboo? Does religion play a part in your sexual life? What does sex mean to you? How often do you like to have sex? Do you have expectations about sex? Do you both feel comfortable and safe talking your needs with each other? Why or why not? How does your partner respond when you talk about your sexual needs? Is he/she offended? Does he/she feel threatened?</p><h3> 3.) Values.</h3><p> Do you have similar or different values? Honesty? Integrity? Family? Work? Religion? Lifestyle? Are you on the same page? Do you argue about them now? If there are differences, are they difficult to resolve? How important are your values? Is there room for compromise?</p><h3> 4.) Extended family.</h3><p> What are the differences in your family of origin? Do your families get along? How significant are the differences? How similar are they? For example, do you come from a family of yellers? Was it hard to express yourself with them? Did people talk over you? What are your family traditions? Do you have any? Will there be a conflict between the traditions &ndash; especially around holiday time?</p><h3> 5.) Money.</h3><p> We all have a relationship with money. What's yours? How do you view money? Are you a spender or a saver? If you have disposable income, how do you spend it? Do you think you should have separate or joint accounts? Both? Does one of you make more money than the other? If so, how will you share the expenses? What about big purchases? Do you have a budget? How will the costs of the home be paid? What about going out &ndash; who takes on that expense? Do you get a bonus at work? What will you do with that money? Talking about money can be a step towards preventing financial infidelity.</p><h3> 6.) Lifestyle.</h3><p> What is your lifestyle like? What are the similarities and differences &ndash; and how big are they? Is one active and one a couch potato? How do you view your down time? What about your use of social media? What are the boundaries? How do you spend your time away from work? What are the expectations regarding time together vs time apart?</p><h3> 7.) Children. </h3><p> Do you want children? How many? What are your parenting styles? Are they similar? How will you reconcile the differences in how you were raised and how you wish to parent if this exists? Do you plan to parent how your parents raised you? What would having a family look like? Who will stay home? Will you both need to work? What about time away from the children? What are your thoughts about how you will go about nurturing the relationship once children arrive on the scene?</p><h3> 8.) Work demands/balance.</h3><p> How important is your work to you? Are you able to balance both work and home demands? How do you do it? Do you worry that once married, this will change? Does your partner understand and support your work, especially if it&rsquo;s overly demanding on your time? Do you discuss the importance of time apart vs time together? Does that worry you? Do you have your own friends and interests outside of the relationship?</p><h3> Obviously, this listed isn't all-inclusive, but if anything, it gives you - the couple - a start.</h3><p> <br/> Are you ready to walk down the aisle, but still feel that you have unresolved issues? Do these questions make you ponder your relationship and whether or not you are making the right decision? Answering yes to any of these questions may indicate that premarital counseling might be a good direction for you.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> To finish off Schwab's IMPACT week, Tom and I got some time with Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger, who has been President and CEO of The Charles Schwab Corporation since 2008. This year he celebrates 20 years at the company. We think you'll enjoy our brief, but enligtening visit. #SchwabIMPACT</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Q. </strong>  Tom and I were there at the beginning of &ldquo;Financial Advisors Service\" as I was an employee in the area and Tom was on the first Advisory Board. We were talking this week and decided that in effect &mdash; Schwab really started an industry of serving the needs of Advisors.  This business has basically killed the &ldquo;broker&rdquo;. In fact no one ever says that word anymore &mdash; people now say &ldquo;Advisor.&rdquo;  How satisfying is that to Mr. Schwab and you?</p><p> Ultimately, what&rsquo;s satisfying to Chuck, me and all of us at Schwab is that more Americans are getting the advice and management of wealth that serves their interests and goals. While we take great pride in the success of our company and its strategy for serving advisors and investors, none of us at Schwab comes to work with the goal of claiming victory over anyone or any particular firm. Chuck founded this company out of a belief in the power of investing and what it could for individuals and families &ndash; if done right. He saw a way to give investors a better deal and better outcomes, and he was successful because he saw things through clients&rsquo; eyes. That&rsquo;s still how we make decisions today.</p><p> What you are seeing in the evolution of how the industry and its professionals talk about themselves today is a recognition that the approach pioneered by independent advisors &ndash; holistic, client-centric, and firmly rooted in plans based on specific goals and objectives &ndash; really resonates with investors. So the traditional firms are adopting some of the same language and some of the same practices, moving away from commissioned-driven sales practices, though, frankly, those practices still exist, and too many investors are still paying too much for solutions and advice that doesn&rsquo;t serve them well.</p><p> We&rsquo;re very gratified if our support and promotion of independent advisors has helped push this industry to better align its practices with the interests of its clients. That&rsquo;s a good thing, and a trend we should encourage.</p><p> <strong>  Q. </strong>  Schwab has always dealt with a need to innovate and evolve while balancing all of the other business lines. We&rsquo;ve seen that happen for 25 years with the Advisor business at Schwab, even as Schwab has developed advice solutions of its own. And yet, we still hear concerns about conflict between your advisor band retail businesses, more recently with the advent of Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.  Is there conflict?  How do you balance the evolution of Schwab&rsquo;s own advice services with the Advisor business, particularly given the importance of both to the company?</p><p> There&rsquo;s no denying those concerns exist, though I think they are often fueled more by pundits than reality. It&rsquo;s certainly not borne out by the success that independent advisors have experienced over the past two decades, at Schwab and in general. Today, through our Advisor Services enterprise, we serve over 7,000 advisors with more than $1 trillion in assets, and independent RIAs in general have seen assets in their care grow from $1.6 trillion to $4 trillion in the last 10 years. Nor do we really see evidence of conflict between advisors and Schwab retail out in the market. That&rsquo;s because Schwab and advisors serve very different kinds of investors and appeal to very different mindsets. Our business with independent advisors is our solution for serving more affluent investors who want and need the breadth of service, customization, personalization and expertise that only independent RIAs can provide. Advisors are very important to our bottom line as a company, for sure, but they are important to us strategically, and philosophically, because the work they do is so beneficial to their clients.</p><p> Has Schwab&rsquo;s retail offering evolved? Absolutely, but so has the advisory profession. All of us know that certain elements of the investment process are being commoditized, requiring new and innovative ways to add value and broaden our services. And as we have evolved, we have worked very hard to provide advisors the support and services they need to remain ever more competitive. Our development of Institutional Intelligent Portfolios is a great example of those efforts. Using that platform to automate a portion of the investing process, advisors have an opportunity to expand their appeal and compete for a broader range of investors, particularly at a lower end of the affluence spectrum than they have previously competed. In essence, it empowers them to compete for investors who might have previously thought to been in Schwab Retail&rsquo;s territory from an affluence or mindset perspective. We&rsquo;ve also just announced a new way for independent advisors to take on a greater role in our 401(k) offering.</p><p> Finally, we all still have huge opportunity for future growth and success. Together, Schwab and RIAs still serve only a small percentage of the investable assets in this country. By our estimates, there are $23 trillion in assets with high net worth household in the U.S. currently not served by an RIA but who would be ideal candidates for their services.</p><p> <strong>  Q. </strong> The evolution of what Schwab has created seems to prove that people want a number of choices &mdash; sometimes on their own, sometimes with an independent advisor, and going forward, with the help of a computer algorithm.  What&rsquo;s your view on where the next generation&rsquo;s choice is going to be &mdash; a person or a keyboard?</p><p> We don&rsquo;t believe the answer is one or the other, but rather a combination of technology and trusted advice from a professional. When you look back at the history of Schwab, it&rsquo;s helpful to remember that when Chuck first started opening branches, most observers thought it was folly. The prevailing wisdom was that self-directed investors would never want to go into a branch, nor did they think Chuck&rsquo;s low-cost model could support a bricks-and-mortar network. But it turned out that with each branch opening, we attracted more clients who welcomed the choice to call us or visit us in person. So most people have never really wanted to go &ldquo;all tech&rdquo; or, for that matter, take care of all of their wealth themselves.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t believe the next generation of investors will be any less nuanced in how they want to manage their money. Certainly, younger investors have come of age in a time when technology has changed their expectations of service providers. They demand and have come to expect immediacy, convenience and service on their terms. And they are surrounded by providers in other industries who are meeting those expectations with technology, apps on their mobile devices and service on demand.</p><p> At the same time, the generation that has come of age since 9/11 has been influenced by the economic and geopolitical turbulence of the past 15 years. It has left them feeling less confident, and more conservative about their finances. In some ways, they are more in need of a calming hand and trusted advice than the Baby Boomers. On the flip side, we are seeing investors across all generations enroll in new technology based investing solutions like Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.</p><p> Going forward, I believe the key to success will be combining human advice, wisdom and service with the best of technology, using the latter to transform and deliver our services in ways that are simple, transparent, and increasingly in tune with how our clients want to interact with us.</p><p> <strong>  Q.  </strong> You&rsquo;ve been at this Company for 20 years now &mdash; it&rsquo;s been a major part of your life.  It&rsquo;s shaped you to be a very successful CEO and you&rsquo;ve helped lead the company to build on its heritage and reputation but also to move it forward in many successful and meaningful ways. How do think about the role Schwab has played in your life, and the role you play in continuing its success?</p><p> Schwab is a very special place, and it has obviously held a very special role in my life, from my early days as a client of Schwab to the opportunity to serve with, and learn from, Chuck Schwab and all of the tremendously talented people who help lead this company and care for our clients every day.</p><p> What was appealing to me about Schwab from the very beginning was the philosophy underlying its strategy. It&rsquo;s a philosophy, as simplistic as it may sound, that if you do the right thing by your clients, they&rsquo;re going to choose to do more business with you, and they&rsquo;re going to refer more clients to you.  It was very consistent with how I had tried to run my company.</p><p> Schwab is an also organization that recognizes the difference between who we are and what we do -- that we may operate as business people, but that we&rsquo;re actually all people first.  And I have benefitted tremendously from that recognition as I have balanced my responsibilities at Schwab with my family priorties.</p><p> So yes, Schwab holds a very special place in my life, but I don&rsquo;t ever make the mistake of thinking Schwab&rsquo;s success is about me. As Chuck has said, our job as leaders of the company is to ensure that Schwab is healthy, thriving and continuing to innovate for the many generations of investors to come. My job, and the job of others who work with me and who will follow in my footsteps, is to further our mission of extending the benefits of investing to as many people as possible, whether we do that directly, or through their retirement plans at work or through the trusted advisors we&rsquo;re fortunate to have worked with for over 25 years. I&rsquo;m honored and privileged to be able to contribute to that mission in any way I can.</p>",

    "title": "Does Independence Make Good Economic Sense?",
    "link": "does-independence-make-good-economic-sense-2",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Five factors you need to consider before taking the next step <br/>  </h3><p> In this day and age of stratospheric wirehouse deals, why are so many uber-productive, high-quality teams forgoing a huge transition incentive check to make the move to independence? While we can all agree that independence offers more freedom, flexibility and control (and for those with true entrepreneurial DNA, that is something hard to put a price tag on), at the end of the day advisors need to understand the economics of independence before they can determine whether it is a viable option for their business.</p><p> When looking at the economics of independence here are five key components to consider:</p><li> <strong>  Upfront Money: </strong>  In the independent space, transition assistance is designed as working capital, largely to defray the costs incurred in setting up a business and to help normalize cash flow as assets are transitioned over. Transition money ranges widely in the independent broker dealer (IBD) space from a low of 10% of recruited T12 from some of the smaller firms, to deals of 30-40% of T12 from some of the larger IBDS. On the very high end, Wells Fargo Fi-Net and Ameriprise will structure aggressive packages of cash, loans and bonuses that can go as high as 100% of T12 for top individuals and teams. In the RIA space, custodians offer working capital financing and soft dollar allowances for marketing, technology or other infrastructure expenses but they do not offer upfront cash. For multi-million dollar teams that need or want more substantial upfront economics, equity investors in the RIA space such as Focus Financial Partners, as well as banks and private equity firms, will purchase a minority share of a breakaway team&rsquo;s business, resulting in a significant monetization for the team within the first year. Lastly, there are a growing number of quasi-independent boutiques that deliver many of the benefits of independence, including open architecture, greater control, and less bureaucracy, combined with attractive transition packages that typically include both cash and equity.</li><li> <strong>  Payout: </strong> In the IBD space payout will range from 85-95% depending on the size and composition of the business (transactional- versus fee-based). After additional tariffs payable to the broker dealer and out of pocket expenses are deducted, advisors should expect to see a net payout in the mid 60% range. In the RIA space an advisor starts out with a 100% payout, and then subtracts custodial fees and the costs of running the business, which often include an outsourced compliance function. Again, an advisor should expect a net payout in the low 60% range. Although net payout in the IBD and RIA space are often quite similar, businesses that sit in the RIA space tend to sell for higher multiples since they are not limited by the restrictions &ndash; both platform and compliance related &ndash; of their broker dealer.</li><li> <strong>  Operating leverage: </strong> In the independent space an advisor, as business owner, captures the operating leverage of his/her business. Typically as top line revenue grows, expenses increase at a slower rate resulting in increased profits dropping to the bottom line. Independent business owners have complete control over their P&amp;L and benefit from the growth of their business more substantially than they could as employees. In an employee framework, the operating leverage of an advisor&rsquo;s business accrues to the firm.</li><li> <strong>  Inorganic growth opportunities: </strong> In the independent space, enterprise-building advisors typically employ multiple initiatives for maximizing the growth of their businesses. In addition to strategies that drive organic growth, acquisitions can leapfrog the growth of an independent business. Acquisition opportunities arise from a generation of aging independent advisors that are looking for a successor and from smaller independent firms that recognize that merging with a larger enterprise will allow them to leverage greater scale, bench strength and infrastructure.</li><li> <strong>  Valuation and Tax Benefits:  </strong> Although the two times revenue metric is widely known as a benchmark for firm valuations, it is not always relevant. Multiples of cash flow/EBITDA combined with other criteria &ndash; such as client demographics, firm growth rates and whether a firm is dependent on one key rainmaker &ndash; also play into valuation. In broad terms, an RIA with assets of at least $100MM is typically valued at four to six times EBITDA, while larger firms with between $500MM &ndash; $1B in AUM sell for five to seven times EBITDA. Firms with over $1B in AUM can see multiples of six to nine times EBITDA. Keep in mind that the sale of a business can be structured to take advantage of capital gains tax treatment, so not only will a top RIA see multiples in the range of 6 to 9 times EBITDA, the sale proceeds will be taxed at a rate far lower than the ordinary income rate. <br/>  </li><p> Clearly the outsized transition money offered by the wirehouses to incent recruitment far eclipses what an advisor would see from an independent model in the short term, yet we continue to see real momentum toward the independent space. (As I write this, a $3.3B Merrill Lynch team in California broke away and went independent with Dynasty Financial Partners and just last week, we moved a father son team in Florida with $1B in client assets from a wirehouse to independence as well.) Advisors who make the leap to independence are willing to take a longer term view, factoring in the accelerated growth opportunities, increased annual cash flow, and tax advantaged &ldquo;sale value&rdquo; of the business at retirement.</p><p> While an outsized incentive check may keep many advisors in the wirehouse world, there are still many others who are looking outside of their current space for opportunities that better suit their own business goals. Understandably, independence is not for everyone. However, for those advisors who have the entrepreneurial spirit and have looked closely at the economics, the move to independence offers not only the opportunity to build real wealth but also the satisfaction that comes from realizing a dream.</p>",

    "title": "Advisors: Is Client Attrition Your Fault?",
    "link": "advisors-is-client-attrition-your-fault",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A while ago I was doing some work with an insurance company and as we were digging through some of the data it transpired that there was a consistent natural attrition rate of about 5-6% of its customers, year after year.  That rate was verified with a couple of other significant businesses, and it seems to be about &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p><p> These are the customers who simply no longer needed the products or service.  No complaints or problems, or dissatisfaction with the provider.  They are happy, but their needs have been met.  The customers had just ceased their business, or moved overseas, or divorced, or whatever&hellip;.there is a natural attrition rate within any client base simply because the customers needs or circumstances have changed.</p><h3> This caused me to think about some of the &ldquo;issues&rdquo; such as &ldquo;churn&rdquo; &ndash; or the accusations of advisers shifting customers away from one provider in favour of another.  </h3><p> <br/> It seems that the typical adviser who is running an ethical business and working in the clients interests is doing reasonably well if they have a lapse rate of around 12% (as measured by the product suppliers).  That is, everyone is relatively happy with this sort of attrition rate &ndash; although the accusations are continually bandied about in the industry that this proportion of business is &ldquo;being shifted&rdquo; by the advisers.  Anything beyond that level is deemed &ldquo;bad&rdquo; apparently.</p><p> Clearly this is cannot be correct if there is a consistent natural attrition rate of (say) 6% p.a.</p><p> If the typical adviser is working with about 400 clients that means there are about 24 clients who move away each year on average, no matter how good the adviser is, or how delightful their service is.   Yet, we are continually reading that this shift is an adviser-driven problem, and that these errant advisers with shifting clients should be run out of town.</p><p> Isn&rsquo;t it conceivable that perhaps the institutions, or product manufacturers themselves also contribute to lost business?</p><p> Poor service, adverse claims experience, nonsensical paperwork which clients cannot understand&hellip;.perhaps poor pricing, contract wordings, poor performance and bad publicity&hellip;..I guess that these things alone would generally contribute another 3% to the attrition rate.  With some suppliers in my experience the actual impact would be much higher.</p><p> So there go another 12 clients through no fault of the adviser.</p><p> The advice business of 400 clients is down to something like 364 or so inside 12 months if these averages hold true.  Of course we have better and worse years, so that can easily be 50 customers lost, or only 15 in reality.  The point is, that is a lot of customers who took a lot of time and left anyway; and; the advice business now has to replace them.</p><p> Nevertheless, for those who remain we are obligated professionally to sit down and review the existing business and plans of the remaining clients in light of all the circumstances at the time of review.  A fund or a policy put in place 3 years ago which was ideal for the client at the time could now be disastrous for them given changes in their circumstances, such as employment status, earnings or tax position, relationships or changes in health.  Regulators expect the advisers to work in the client&rsquo;s best interests, as do our own professional ethics, so we now find that of the 150 clients who have had a full review in the last year there are probably a further 22 or so (being 15% of remaining clients) whose circumstances have changed substantially enough to warrant a product substitution.  If the adviser doesn&rsquo;t substitute products they stand to be accused of ignoring the clients best interests, and are instead protecting either their own or the product manufacturers interests.</p><h3> The end result is that it is absolutely understandable that any professional adviser can experience a persistency loss of perhaps 14-15% in each and every year just because they are doing their work ethically and dealing with human beings whose lives change.  </h3><p> <br/> The product manufacturers have a tendency to prefer to call this an adviser-led problem.  Twisting. Churn. Business replacement&hellip;..</p><p> Of course those terms only get used by product manufacturers when business is moving away from them.  When replacement business is moving away from another manufacturer and coming to them it is called &ldquo;new business&rdquo; and it is all ok.  There are of course bad apples, and some advisers who make a living out of offering nothing of real value other than a minimal price saving for clients. They are in the arbitrage business perhaps, however the minimal price savings they can source are usually insufficient to present any discernible benefit for the client. They are twisters.  They exist.  They are well and truly the minority though.</p><p> The reality is the majority of advisers have an enormous issue in servicing and satisfying clients to begin with, and there is an inevitable loss of clients anyway.  It is natural attrition.  Beyond that, there is the professional requirement to re-consider past advice and recommendations and update the advice in light of changing client and market circumstances.  To top it off, clients are consistently being marketed to by a huge number of alternative providers and advisers, with the very real risk of being seduced away by something which may or may not actually be better than what they are doing currently.  But slick marketing continues to be used because it gets results, and so more clients move from the adviser practice despite the advisers best efforts.</p><p> How much of this business turnover in the industry is really to be laid at the adviser population&rsquo;s feet?  More importantly, could it be that &ldquo;churn&rdquo; is not actually an issue at all?</p><p> Consumers shifting rapidly from product to product, oftentimes on a whim or a piece of slick marketing, is in fact the new normal.  It is how the world is now across multiple industries.  So it is in financial services too.</p><p> Perhaps it is time to move the discussion away from &ldquo;churn&rdquo; as the problem, to learning how to interpret what is actually a normal business model in these new consumer-led, and regulator-scrutinised, times.</p>",

Here&rsquo;s how:</p><li> <strong>  Start with a spending plan </strong> (a sexier name for budget). Your goal is to come up with a spending plan that won&rsquo;t put you in a financial straitjacket. How much can you allocate from your savings or income to make the holidays work? Beginning with that end in mind will avoid runaway spending and the ultimate misery that brings. Once you&rsquo;ve settled on the amount, you can begin thinking about the people on your list&mdash;what gift would be most special to each of them? Remember, your spending plan is not a suggestion, it is a fixed number.</li><li> <strong>  Get on the &ldquo;Expectation&rdquo; train. </strong> It&rsquo;s wonderful that you have created your spending plan, but it might bump fiercely against the expectations of others. Just like any project, getting all your stakeholders together to discuss and set expectations is crucial. Before the chaos begins, gather your family and talk about the plan&mdash;why it&rsquo;s important and how they can add to the success of the plan. This way everyone has a given task, set of chores or responsibility to make the holiday a treasured part of life. Begin with a simple question: what would make this holiday special and memorable?</li><li> <strong>  Prepare, prepare, prepare. </strong> Like anything we do in life, it&rsquo;s better to show up prepared. That might involve thoughtful research and careful communications. Think &ldquo;genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration&rdquo; and make a plan. Deal shopping without a carefully crafted plan is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. You buy the great deal and only then think about whom it will fit. Better to sweat the details in advance than to pant across the finish line with nothing left in the tank to celebrate.</li><li> <strong>  Pull the ripcord. </strong> Nothing happens without action. You&rsquo;ve done the pre-work, you&rsquo;ve set expectations and have done the research&mdash;now it&rsquo;s time to put your holiday plans into effect. Whether you&rsquo;re shopping on-line or hitting the malls, keep your spending plan front and center and check off each accomplishment. How much more fun is this vs diving into the fray unprepared?</li><li> <strong>  Stick with your plan. </strong> You&rsquo;ve devised a personal plan to provide maximum enjoyment with minimum stress. So enjoy each aspect to the fullest degree possible. After all, your loved ones are on board and that&rsquo;s all that matters. You can let all the crazies around you gnash their collective teeth while you enjoy this celebratory time. <br/>  </li><p> By following these simple steps, you&rsquo;ll create a new holiday mindset for yourself (and your family). One that embraces the joy of the season and moves you happily into the New Year&mdash;without the dread of a stack of bills you can&rsquo;t afford.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  When I get the call, \"my partner is not doing what he/she promised to do and I'm doing all the work\", </strong> I know that they haven't been meeting.</p><p> Regular meetings are often avoided by business partners and even businesses in general.  Sometimes they are seen as a waste of time because not a lot gets accomplished. They may be considered boring, time consuming and sometimes emotions take over when disagreements come up. As a mentor and coach to business owners I insist that partners meet on a regular schedule and also with their teams.</p><p> <strong>  Partners who do not have regular ongoing scheduled meetings to clarify, plan and strategize are jeopardizing their very partnership and the business. </strong> What I know as a fact, when partners and departments within a business don't talk to each other, at the very least, misunderstandings and false assumptions abound, ill feelings begin to fester, the business does not function as well as it could and for certain,  money is left on the table.  Eventually I may get the call to rescue a dying partnership relationship.</p><p> Tad and Jonathan were ready to quit when they called me. Each accused the other of not fulfilling the tasks they were obligated to do.  They barely remembered the last time they met to discuss the business. Each focused on whatever he thought he should and viewed the other as the problem when things didn't work.</p><p> It was mind boggling to hear the differences in perception of where they were and where they were going. As they worked separately without consulting each other, the space between them was widening.</p><p> In  facilitating the difficult conversation between them the first thing I taught them was how to listen to each other. They were grateful and amazed that they could have a conversation that left out the emotions. Next they came to the realization that their basic original desires and dreams for this business were still the same and they actually still liked each other. It became clear that the resentment that each of them was harboring about the other was the result of not communicating. Although each was doing what he thought he should, they were on separate paths. Tad was in charge of finances and the IT department. Managers of the various teams, design, production, marketing and fulfillment reported directly to Jonathan. But even the team managers didn't meet and nowhere was the infrastructure to discuss how everything fit into the big picture of the original vision and mission the partners had planned. One of the greatest advantages of having a partner was ignored; having someone to share responsibility, brainstorm new ideas, and ongoing evaluations about what is working and what isn't.</p><p> <strong>  Regular meetings with tight and useful agenda items keep the work of the business on track with the parts fitting together like a well-oiled machine the effects of which show up in a growing bottom line. </strong></p><p> Overcome your habit of avoiding meetings and build in meaningful schedules to talk about the big picture and the details at least once a week. You have made a major investment of time, maybe money and your dream. Your business affects many people besides yourselves.  Don't let it fail.</p>",

    "link": "the-end-of-a-bank-account-as-the-digital-me-takes-over",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "I had a really interesting conversation with Chris Barker, Head of Digital and Engineering for Royal Bank of Scotland.  As usual, the conversation moved around data analytics, deep learning, artificial intelligence, building enterprise data systems, separating content from processing, re-platforming the back-end infrastructure and core systems and more.  I&rsquo;ll write more about that stuff tomorrow, but the bit that intrigued me is when Chris said<strong> he can see the idea of a bank account disappearing.</strong>Now this builds on an idea I&rsquo;ve already blogged about &ndash; the <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/05/why-the-blockchain-will-radically-alter-our-futures.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> digital identity</a> on a shared ledger concept &ndash; but this went further, so here&rsquo;s how and why &lsquo;bank accounts&rsquo; are going to be unnecessary in the very near future.In a physical world of money and travel, individuals needed very safe and secure places to store value, and trusted authorities to issue them identities.  This meant that Governments had to provide you with identifiers such as a passport and driving licence, and banks had to have those proofs of identity to open an account for you.  That account was guaranteed to be managed on your behalf as a safe and secure store of value.  You had other issued services, like health certificates and loyalty cards, because these proofs of access and identity and stores of value were all being managed through the physical exchange of value, goods and services.<strong> Now we live in a world that is turning digital, and digital means democratisation and decentralisation. </strong>We are putting power into the individual&rsquo;s hands and so, rather than having multiple identifiers from a central authority who issues you with proofs of access, you now have your own digital bucket for which you can issue access to central authorities on an as-needed basis.  There are no multiple external and centralised stores of your proofs, just one decentralised store that you manage.If that happens, the contention is that the idea of a bank account that is stored externally by an authority who can centralise and transact on your behalf becomes irrelevant.Think about it: you have this deposit account system, for you to give your things of value to a trusted external third party who manages, stores and exchanges your value tokens on your behalf.  If we have moved to a federated, shared, open digital ledger, why do you need a trusted third party to look after your identifiers and proofs?  Why do you need a central authority to deal with your movement and needs?These are fairly fundamental questions, and does lead to a conclusion that is quite uncomfortable and disturbing, for some, but exciting and a great opportunity for others.  The conclusion is this.Banks, as I have maintained for some time now, were built in the last century for the physical distribution of paper in a localised network based upon buildings and humans.  To manage that physical structure, our identities, proofs and store of value had to be validated by centralised authorities who are trusted to provide these identifiers, such as banks and governments.But now, we live in a world where value and identity is being digitised to support the digital distribution of data through a globalised network focused upon software and servers.  To manage this digital structure, our identities, proofs and store of value has to be validated by the individual as a democratised, decentralised structure cannot operate if a centralised third party has to manage them.This will be the most significant change in the world of finance if true: the movement of identity to a federated, shared open ledger system (blockchain protocol if you prefer) where everyone can be trusted because the internet validates who owns what and can trade with whom.  As Bob Greifeld, CEO of NASDAQ said last week, this technology enables me to trust you without knowing you.  That can only happen if we own our digital selves and, in owning the digital me, I won&rsquo;t need a bank account.<strong> UPDATE</strong>The first comment I received on this blog entry is that my owning the digital me sounds like \"storing your pound notes under your own mattress\".  Unfortunately this misses the point, as storing notes under the mattress is a physical metaphor.  In this digital me world, my money is just data and I can store it where it's most secure.  That probably is not in a bank account, but in a Trezon or Ledger wallet.  The key is to consider that you are now dealing with secure data stores, not potentially insecure bank accounts.",

    "title": "Social Security Planning Just Got More Complicated",
    "link": "social-security-planning-just-got-more-complicated",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Here we go again! Already one of the most complicated of government programs, the bipartisan Budget Bill signed last week has created a great deal of confusion and complication for those looking to social security to provide income in retirement. </strong> <br/> <br/> Before the new legislation, there were over 2,700 rules governing social security. A typical couple had as many as 567 different flying options. Now, with the new legislation, there are even more rules and potential options depending on your age and marital status. <br/> <br/> In broad terms, there are now basically 4 different groups of social security beneficiaries with correspondingly different sets of filing rules to abide by: <br/> <br/> 1. Those who are already collecting. <br/> 2. Those who will turn age 66 (or older) by May 1, 2016. <br/> 3. Those who will turn age 62 (or older) by 12/31/15. <br/> 4. Those who will turn age age 62 after 12/31/15 <br/> <br/> <br/> For those in group #1, there will be no changes to their benefits, generally speaking, provided that they continue to receive their benefits as is and do not voluntarily suspend their benefits. For example, if the worker from whom spousal benefits are collected against were to voluntarily suspend receipt of their benefits (eg. in order to receive an 8% annual increase in benefits to age 70) after May 1,2016, then any spousal or children's benefits paid against their record would also cease. <br/> <br/> For group #2, those individuals who will turn age 66 (or older) by May 1, 2016, there is still a very short \"6 Month Window\" of opportunity to take advantage of a filing strategy called \"file and suspend\". For many clients eligible to do so, this filing strategy could provide as much as $50,000-$300,000 or more in additional lifetime social security benefits. After May 1, 2016, this filing option will no longer be available. <br/> <br/> <strong>  CAUTION: </strong> It is critical to note that \"file and suspend\" may not always be the best filing option in all cases even for those still eligible to do so. In fact, in some cases it could actually result in a loss of as much as $50,000 or more in benefits. It's critical for filers to consult with a social security income specialist before taking any action regarding \"file and suspend\". Just because you may be eligible to do \"file and suspend\" doesn't mean it will always be your best filing option. <br/> <br/> For those in group # 3, individuals who will turn age 62 or older by 12/31/15, there remains an abundance of valuable filing options available to enhance lifetime benefits. This is because the changes to the \"deemed filing rules\" do not apply to this group. As a result, there remain a number of filing strategies available to provide for spousal and divorced-spousal benefits which can significantly increase lifetime benefits.  This can be a very complicated area of social security income maximization planning so it's important to consult with a specialist in this area before filing. <br/> <br/> For group #4, virtually all of the \"exotic\" filing strategies will no longer be available.  However, it's important to understand just how valuable social security benefits still are. They typically provide for 30-60% of most filers income in retirement even without any special filing options. <br/> <br/> It's best to think of social security benefits like a \"big cake\". As a result of last week's budget bill, most of the \"icing\" is off the cake for those who turn age 62 after 12/31/15. However, it remains a \"very big cake\"!  For most retirees, social security remains their only true pension plan in retirement and can easily provide as much as $1 million or more in lifetime benefits for many couples in retirement. <br/> <br/> As a result of last week's Budget Bill, <strong>  it is more critical than ever to find out what your social security benefits will be under the new federal regulations </strong> , what would be the best time to file and what would be the best way to co-ordinate these benefits with your other retirement assets.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Confirmation bias &ndash; a tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one&rsquo;s existing beliefs or theories &ndash; is a nasty little critter we need to watch out for as leaders.</p><p> You may have noticed this insidious decision-making villain running rampant during election season. We subconsciously seek out information that supports our favoured candidates and negatively portrays the opposing candidates.</p><p> When it comes to leadership, confirmation bias can distort our decision-making like nothing else.</p><p> This snippet from the book, On Making Smart Decisions (featuring &ldquo;Before You Make That Big Decision&hellip;&rdquo; by Daniel Kahneman, Dan Lovallo and Olivier Sibony), explains why we need to take stock of this phenomenon:</p><p> &ldquo;A team that has fallen in love with its recommendation, for instance, may subconsciously dismiss evidence that contradicts its theories, give far too much weight to one piece of data, or make faulty comparisons to another business case.That&rsquo;s why, with important decisions, executives need to conduct a careful review not only of the content of recommendations, but of the recommendation process.&rdquo;</p><h3> Here are 6 ways to prevent confirmation bias running riot in your leadership: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Seek contrary evidence</h3><p> Especially on those decisions with significant impact. When you are REALLY hot on your proposed idea.</p><h3> 2. Be self-aware</h3><p> Regularly ask yourself these questions:</p><li> How wed am I to this idea?</li><li> How could my enthusiasm and passion be blindsiding me?</li><li> If I was to play Devil&rsquo;s Advocate in this situation, what could that offer up?</li><li> How can looking at this from another perspective make the way forward more robust?</li><li> What if I entertained the idea for a moment that I held incorrect assumptions in this instance?</li><li> What are at least two arguments against my current position? <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s more difficult to do this than you think!</p><h3> 3. Get your people to challenge your thinking on a regular basis</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t take a leaf out of Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s book, who executes those officials who dare challenge him. Make it safe for those you lead to disagree with you. See here for more ideas on how. Seek counsel from those who you respect and will tell you how it  is really, even when you don&rsquo;t want to hear it.</p><h3> 4. Seek experiences and people beyond your circle of comfort</h3><p> Travel. Learn about others&rsquo; cultures. Spend time trying to understand the perspective of those whose opinions you vehemently disagree with. Do this with the energy of purely trying to understand them, not being positional or trying to convert them to your thinking.</p><h3> 5. Regularly reflect on trends in your decision-making</h3><p> There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with knowing your values and being clear on your direction. It&rsquo;s another story if you are being dogmatic, static or stuck in your thinking. Ask &ldquo;what is something I used to believe in passionately, but which now I&rsquo;m not so sure?&rdquo; If you can&rsquo;t answer, it&rsquo;s not a good sign.</p><h3> 6. Listen</h3><p> Often. And deeply. My  <u>  <a href=\"http://idealog.co.nz/workplace/2015/08/why-listening-mother-all-leadership-skills-and-4-ways-cultivate-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   last Idealog article  </a> </u>  shows why this is a great skill to develop. If you are listening in this way, it&rsquo;s less likely you will fall victim to confirmation bias.</p><p> A type of confirmation bias nearly all leaders are guilty of is the process by which we give undue weight to early evidence. By accepting early information, we risk creating a bias which affects our view of any later evidence.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.internetretailer.com/2014/05/12/us-online-retail-sales-will-grow-57-2018\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Forrester Research analysts  </a> </u>  speculate that  <strong>  U.S. online retail sales will grow 57% by 2018 and that the web will account for 11% of all retail sales. </strong> Even more impressive is the predicted  <strong>  $1.13 trillion online B2B eCommerce </strong>  forecasted for 2020. In fact, it&rsquo;s believed that the percentage of people making more than half their business purchases online will grow from a third to more than 50%.</p><p> Much of this online business growth will be facilitated by optimizing for mobile and tablet traffic, improving last-minute shipping capabilities, and pricing goods and services competitively. It&rsquo;s an exciting time to manage a company&rsquo;s online presence! However, fast growth isn&rsquo;t always a good thing if you&rsquo;re unprepared. Having a fast, optimized website is crucial to your success. That&rsquo;s the easy part of growing a business online, though.</p><p> The number of online business growth tactics is vast. As RJ Metrics explains, there are TONS of steps you can take to grow your business in the coming year &mdash; &ldquo;You can write more content, better content, improve SEO, hire more employees, start an Instagram promotion, boost social sharing, do a publicity stunt, use PPC advertising, guest blogging, or get better at email marketing&rdquo; &mdash; but determining what you should do to most dramatically improve your bottom line is a trickier matter. Janessa Lantz advises beginning your efforts on the areas where you&rsquo;re weakest.  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2014/01/09/a-marketing-strategy-to-grow-your-online-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Check out her article  </a> </u>  to determine what that might be.</p><p> In this article, we&rsquo;ll also cover 8 commonly-overlooked impediments to business growth that our consultants encounter working with dozens of small and big business clients each year.</p><h3> 8 Reasons Your Business Is Not Growing</h3><h3> 1. Your strategies need updating.</h3><p> <br/> There are some online business growth strategies that have remained tested, tried and true throughout the years &mdash; such as email marketing, PPC advertising, SEO and blogging. Of course, there are subtle nuances within each of these broader categories that are continually changing with the times &mdash; sometimes as often as every few months. Also, for some businesses, the strategies that have yielded the fastest growth have come hot off the presses with the launch of sites like Facebook and Pinterest, or the widespread adoption of marketing automation and analytics software.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/38109.asp#singleview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   iMediaConnection  </a> </u>  says some of the most outdated digital marketing strategies include:</p><li> &ndash; Managing emarketing campaigns by impressions, clicks, and budget forecasts, rather than conversion rates, cost-per-action and cost-per-customer.</li><li> &ndash; Black Hat SEO that attempts to game the system, rather than following  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=35769\" target=\"_blank\">   Google&rsquo;s recommendations  </a> </u></li><li> &ndash; Renting email lists, rather than building them in-house</li><li> &ndash; Sending non-targeted, unsegmented and impersonal emails</li><li> &ndash; Focusing content on keywords, without regard for context</li><li> &ndash; Setting your sights on producing quantity of content, rather than quality</li><li> &ndash; Failing to adopt ad retargeting strategies</li><li> &ndash; Avoiding landing page A/B testing</li><li> &ndash; Failing to target prospects based on recent behaviors using marketing automation</li><li> &ndash; Underestimating the power of podcasts and online video</li><li> &ndash; Buying fake online reviews, social media followers or video views</li><p> <img alt=\"How to grow your business with content marketing\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/How-to-grow-your-business-using-content-marketing2.jpg\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://dendritepark.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dendrite Park  </a> </u></p><h3> 2. You&rsquo;re too focused on one-upping the competition.</h3><p> <br/> While we conduct a fair amount of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/our-process/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   industry and competitive research  </a> </u>  for our clients, we carefully emphasize that business success is not as simple as copying an industry leader&rsquo;s strategies, tactics and brand image.</p><p> There is  <u>  <a href=\"http://socialtriggers.com/copying-competitors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a smart way to &ldquo;copy&rdquo; competitors  </a> </u>  &mdash; and a dumb way &mdash; as Social Triggers points out. Knowing what other industry thought leaders are up to is smart business, but you don&rsquo;t want to make any  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.serviceautopilot.com/copying-your-competition-is-killing-your-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   copycat moves  </a> </u>  that you really can&rsquo;t afford, that will spread you too thin, that will grow your offerings faster than your service department, or that will make you unhappy with the increased burdens.</p><p> We create unique custom plans for our clients that serve the goals and needs of the organization, rather than simply dishing out a cookie cutter plan to replicate. In our experience, when given the choice, most people want to do business with a companies that are original, trend-setting and authentic.</p><h3> 3. You let SEO and traffic building agendas fall by the wayside.</h3><p> <br/> With  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.searchenginejournal.com/many-deaths-seo-2015/123311/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   so many overly dramatic articles on &ldquo;the death of SEO,&rdquo;  </a> </u>  it&rsquo;s no surprise that many marketers turned their backs on the old-school objective of building traffic in favor of pursuing social media engagement or web design strategies. Don&rsquo;t throw the baby out with the bath water just yet. Traffic-building content strategies like seeking podcast interviews and writing guest posts are still worthwhile ventures. Good old keyword research, technical on-page SEO tweaks, SEO content strategizing and site traffic monitoring are all still practices you need for robust business growth. Failing to optimize for search engines and solicit high-quality links allows thousands of potential customers to breeze by your website.</p><h3> 4. You got too caught up in social media hype.</h3><p> <br/> It happens to the best of us &mdash; not just in business, but in our personal lives as well: we waste altogether too much time on social media. As this infographic demonstrates, there are many reasons to add social media marketing to your digital marketing strategy to grow your business:</p><p> However, the fact that you have to &ldquo;pay to play&rdquo; nowadays is a game-changer, particularly for companies with limited budgets, and it&rsquo;s all too easy for companies to get lost on the platform with willy-nilly updates that lack a coherent strategy. Every post and minute spent on social media sites should be strategic and based on sound data.</p><p> You Might Also Like:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-steps-solid-social-media-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   8 Steps To A Solid Social Media Strategy  </a> </u> <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/8-steps-solid-social-media-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    </a></p><h3> 5. You&rsquo;re more worried about thought leadership than engagement.</h3><p> <br/> There is one school of thought that says &ldquo;True leaders are not always available and cost a premium if you want to access their time.&rdquo; Sadly, this is also a great way to alienate buyers and scare off good business. Remaining accessible and engaging customers in a friendly, direct manner is quickly becoming the standards for customer service and client interaction in the digital age.</p><p> Did you know it costs  <u>  almost 7 times as much </u>  to solicit a new customer as it does to sell to an existing customer? That&rsquo;s a pretty substantial reason to focus on relationship building through email marketing, social media, video marketing, soliciting customer feedback, and ad retargeting &mdash; rather than simply putting all your eggs in the press release, guest posting, LinkedIn forum, &ldquo;thought leadership&rdquo; basket.</p><h3> 6. You&rsquo;re not tracking the numbers that matter.</h3><p> <br/> Data can be oppressive. We get it. Not everyone enjoys digging into the nitty-gritty details of marketing like we do. Yet, companies who want to experience growth understand that metrics are a necessary evil. You don&rsquo;t want to get so caught up in the finer points of marketing that you miss the big picture and end up  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236677\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   micromanaging your team  </a> </u>  with a whirlwind of constant changes, of course, so it&rsquo;s important that you&rsquo;re tracking the right numbers and updating your strategy at scheduled intervals that is acceptable to all parties seated at the table.</p><p> We&rsquo;re happy to discuss the world of metrics with you, but generally,  <u>  some things you should be tracking </u>  include:</p><li> &ndash; Cost per lead</li><li> &ndash; Registration rate</li><li> &ndash; Conversion rate</li><li> &ndash; Number of leads needed per customer acquisition</li><li> &ndash; Customer acquisition cost</li><li> &ndash; Lifetime value to customer acquisition ratio <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sujanpatel/2015/05/13/why-you-should-ignore-vanity-metrics-focus-on-engagement-metrics-instead/\" target=\"_blank\">   Vanity metrics  </a> </u>  like like page views, number of followers, or free report downloads should be thrown by the wayside.</p><h3> 7. You&rsquo;ve invested in more technology than you need.</h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/in-house-vs-agency-digital-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"In-house vs marketing agency\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/In-house-vs-marketing-agency.png\"/> </a></p><p> The average business owner receives many pitches from B2B software firms. There are countless articles on the &ldquo;latest and greatest&rdquo; technology that will simplify life for today&rsquo;s entrepreneur. Unfortunately, many companies fail to grow because their bottom lines are sucked up by so much technology &mdash; much of it all for naught. We fully understand the need to be competitive using all the latest digital marketing tools and the enormous expense that comes along with it. We provide our clients with access to more than $40,000 worth of marketing tools, such as Raven Tools, Sprout Social, Release Wire, aWeber, HootSuite, Manage Flitter and more. Another strategy aside from hiring us to handle certain aspects of your marketing campaigns is to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   do as Entrepreneur recommends  </a> </u>  and look for &ldquo;free or lower-cost alternatives&rdquo; that may deliver only the features you need, with options to scale up later, as your business grows.</p><h3> 8. You&rsquo;re afraid that asking for help will cost you too much money.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Reluctance to outsource tasks or partner with complementary businesses&rdquo; is a major reason for stagnation, says  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepreneur Magazine  </a> </u> . Check out our infographic on the benefits of outsourcing:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/in-house-vs-agency-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Marketing agency vs. in-house\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marketing-agency-vs.-in-house.png\"/> </a></p><p> &ldquo;Outsourcing marketing tasks is a trend that&rsquo;s here to stay,&rdquo; says  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/b2b-marketing/9-reasons-why-outsourcing-b2b-marketing-functions-can-increase-growth-01347638#q6tiVaVREWgKIoPe.97\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Business2Community&rsquo;s Sabrina Ferraioli  </a> </u> . Onboarding new hires internally can skyrocket your overhead costs too quickly, she warns. On top of that, modern digital marketing requires in-depth knowledge of industry best practices, a vast skill set and the ability to keep an eye on the big picture that many firms lose when they try to do everything in-house.</p><p> As entrepreneur and author  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/204652\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Walsh  </a> </u>  put it; &ldquo;Progressive entrepreneurs realize the unstoppable power of outsourcing to handle aspects of their business that are essential but simply don&rsquo;t make sense for them to deal with personally. Small business, augmented by a global pool of human capital, can compete directly with the biggest players in their space, and win.&rdquo;</p><p> Tonya Thomas, president of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smallofficeassistant.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Small Office Assistant  </a> </u>  recalled the decision to outsource as a difficult one. &ldquo;At first I felt like I was the only person who could do the work efficiently; I wanted control over everything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I wanted my business to grow and in order to do that I had to let go and start delegating.&rdquo; The first year she hired outside contractors, she doubled her company&rsquo;s revenue, reports  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/204652\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepreneur Magazine  </a> </u> . </p>",

Out of the vast body of borrowers in active repayment, six percent were in Pay As You Earn or other income driven repayment plans, and 13 percent were in income-based repayment. This leaves 81 percent of those repaying their loans with higher payments and with those payments a higher risk of defaulting. Here are some key facts that you need to know about loan forgiveness and income driven repayment plans.</p><p> There are some encouraging signs that  <u>  <a href=\"http://hechingerreport.org/student-loan-default-rates-drop-are-income-driven-repayment-plans-the-reason/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   student loan default rates  </a> </u>  are dropping, possibly because of income driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs and improving economic conditions that result in loan holders obtaining jobs that provide them with enough discretionary income to repay their loans. Getting the word out is critical to resolving one of the largest pools of debt in the nation&rsquo;s history, as well as freeing students from what has essentially become indentured servitude.</p><h3> Types of Income-Driven Plans</h3><p> <br/> There are three different types of income-drive payment plans:</p><li> Income-based repayment plan</li><li> Pay as you earn repayment plan</li><li> Income-contingent repayment plan <br/>  </li><p> If you are outstanding debt is higher than your income, or if repaying that debt represents a large portion of your income, you may be eligible for these plans. Most federally originated student loans are eligible for at least one. These types of repayment plans are based on a percentage of your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryincome.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discretionary income  </a> </u> .</p><li> Depending on when you borrowed, the income-based repayment plan will take 10 to 15 percent of your discretionary income, but your payment will never be more than it would be under the 10 year standard repayment plan. These plans you 20 to 25 years to repay your loans.</li><li> The pay as you earn plan will generally take 10 percent of your discretionary income, under the same rules as the income-based repayment plan. Under this plan it will take you up to 20 years to repay your student loans.</li><li> The income-contingent repayment plan will take 20 percent of your discretionary income, or what you would pay for a fixed payment over the course of 12 years adjusted for income. The income -contingent repayment plan will give you up to 25 years to repay your loans. <br/>  </li><p> If there is any loan balance remaining at the end of these terms that loan balance is forgiven. In addition, during times of economic hardship or service in the Armed Forces you may qualify for a  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance#deferment-eligibility\" target=\"_blank\">   loan deferment  </a> </u>  if you have direct loans, FFEL loans, or Perkins loans. You may also qualify for  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service\" target=\"_blank\">   loan forgiveness  </a> </u>  if you are working a qualified public sector position under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> As part of our 2015 IMPACT series, we got to spend a few minutes with <a href=\"https://www.aboutschwab.com/bernard-clark\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bernie Clark  </u> </a> , head of Schwab Advisor Services and a member of Charles Schwab&rsquo;s Executive Committee. This year IMPACT celebrates its 25th year in Boston from November 10th through the 13th. For more information, follow  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Schwab4RIAS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @Schwab4RIAS  </a> </u>  or #SchwabIMPACT, or visit  <u>  <a href=\"http://impact.schwab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   impact.schwab.com  </a>  . </u> Enjoy.</h3><strong> Q.</strong>How has the advisor evolved in the past 20 years &mdash; &ldquo;Practices are now &ldquo;Firms&rdquo;?Firms have evolved, for sure. What used to be considered a cottage industry, is now a growing, sophisticated profession. Advisors have taken their work from professionally managed offices with great teams to full-blown enterprises with incredible momentum.Firms are incredibly strategic today. They&rsquo;re creating visions and are focused on delivering the client experience of the future, and not just by investing in new technologies and infrastructure, but by recruiting and developing top talent.  Most importantly, their clients are still the heart of their businesses &ndash; and always will be.<strong> Q.</strong>What does their evolution mean for their clients? How does a more professional firm benefit the end client?Clients of independent firms today probably have easier access to their information; they may see more sophisticated reports and experience similar benefits that come along with maturing industry. But the advisors themselves &ndash; what they do, and how they go about it - that hasn&rsquo;t changed.The relationships the advisors have established are the heart of their business model, and I don&rsquo;t see that changing. Advisors place the interests of their clients first &ndash; just like they always have. In turn, clients trust their advisors with their most important assets &ndash; their life&rsquo;s savings and the financial well-being of their families.The evolution that has taken place actually makes it possible for advisors to serve an even bigger role in doing work that matters in the lives of their clients. Values-based practices are what made this industry a success, and that is timeless.<strong> Q.</strong>You and your competitors offer Advisor Firms so much in terms of Business Consulting, Succession Planning, Leadership Development and so much more. What seems left out from this current narrative is the real blocking and tackling &mdash; or trading and client service. Are these things still an important part of your existence?We&rsquo;re proud to offer value-added services that help our advisors differentiate and grow, including offerings like Institutional Intelligent Portfolios&trade;, allowing advisors to participate in one of the newest growth areas in investing.But for us, job number one will always be custody and trading. It is the foundation of our business, and at the core of our relationships with each of our advisors.Delivering a custodial experience second to none is, in fact, what gives us permission to increase the scope of what we offer, going beyond the confines of what is expected to deliver on what&rsquo;s next, if you will.<strong> Q.</strong>Give us some insight into the growth of Advisor Services, not in terms of the number of people or Advisor managed client assets &mdash; talk about the people involved in the area &mdash; what&rsquo;s been the evolution of that person and how a collection of those people impacted the business as a whole?What has been great about the growth of Advisor Services at Schwab is this &ndash; we see top talent building complete careers within our group, and not just those who have grown up serving advisors. We recruit from across the company, and I&rsquo;m proud to see Advisor Services drawing interest from retail, from other parts of our business, and even from different industries altogether. It&rsquo;s exciting.While I&rsquo;m biased, I have to say, we have some of the best leaders working in Advisor Services &ndash; it has become a destination for many. And I&rsquo;m not just talking about Schwab &ndash; we have some of the best leaders in the entire Financial Services industry. They&rsquo;re growing great teams, which is a lot of fun to watch.When you put together a terrific team of people in a growing and dynamic part of the business, it&rsquo;s magic.<strong> Q.</strong>With so much technology being used today &mdash; is there going to come a time when custody is a commodity?Custody is job number one. It is fundamental &ndash; greens fees, really. And with our businesses based on trust and transparency, I don&rsquo;t see that changing.Will there be more advances in the custodial experience to make it easier, simpler for people? Sure. But I&rsquo;d argue that alone doesn&rsquo;t make it a commodity.There&rsquo;s nothing more important to advisors than the experience their clients have. Custody and trading play a huge role there; we work hard every day to be the best solution &ndash; because that&rsquo;s what our advisors, and their clients, deserve.<strong> Q.</strong>Your competitors&rsquo; businesses are also seeming to mature &mdash; what are the things that set Advisors Services apart today from them?Two things &ndash; it&rsquo;s our experience and our people. We have logged nearly three decades working side by side with advisors. They&rsquo;ve taught us what works best, and we&rsquo;ve been able to share our experience and the firm&rsquo;s collective knowledge to help them grow.<h3> Our relationships with advisors &ndash; both the ones we&rsquo;ve worked with for years and the ones new to our platform - they&rsquo;re the inspiration for what we do, and the reason we work every day to do what we do best &ndash; serve RIAs.</h3>We also follow a &ldquo;Through Clients&rsquo; Eyes&rdquo; strategy at Schwab. That means we make decisions based on our advisors and their clients&rsquo; interests, experience and their future. Seeing the world this way matters, and it&rsquo;s just what we do.  Of course, this is only made possible by the great people at Schwab, they&rsquo;re our best asset.<strong> Q.</strong>Being on a call with Nick (Georgis) today, and talking about what he does &mdash; the main thing that came across to us was the care he puts into what he does and how Schwab treasures each and every relationship. I think it was 'no advisor is the same, we have no baseline advisor.'  We hear that over and over again. How have you been able to create that feeling in all of your employees?<h3> Our employees take so much pride in serving our clients, and that is honestly one of my favorite things about my job.</h3>Truthfully, it happens naturally. Anyone who works with advisors gets the fever, so to speak! It is fun to work alongside independent business owners, and there is something incredibly special and rewarding about helping entrepreneurs do what they do best.We serve more than 7,000 independent advisors on our platform today, each one with a unique story and a vision for their future that we&rsquo;re lucky enough to get to help them realize.Interestingly, before Walt Bettinger joined Schwab, he was a client of Schwab&rsquo;s, and so no one understands how important it is that we stay true to serving our advisors&rsquo; individual needs more than our own CEO.When your purposes are aligned, as ours is with our advisors around putting clients first &ndash; it makes doing what we do easy.",

    "content": "<p> Your consulting or advisory business is tooling along, but falls far short of the big platform performance you&rsquo;ve always envisioned.</p><p> Or you have a big, bold idea and it&rsquo;s just not catching fire with your audience&mdash;it feels like you&rsquo;re on a too-small stage, talking only to yourself and the same handful of &ldquo;believers&rdquo;.</p><p> It might be time for a brand makeover&mdash;a re-think of your strategy and positioning, visuals and copy. Here are a few signs it&rsquo;s time to take a fresh look.</p><li> <strong>  You want to appeal to a niche market. </strong>  Your brand strategy may need some tinkering to identify and connect with the right niche to power your offerings up a notch (or six). Say you&rsquo;ve realized you love working with physicians&mdash;and you&rsquo;d like to cast your net to reach more of them. Your brand&mdash;the images and the voice of your copy&mdash;needs to shift to focus more pointedly on the needs of your M.D. niche. And your marketing and pipeline building efforts may need to morph along with it.</li><li> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve created a thrilling new _______(service, program, book, product) and are in search of the right audience. </strong>  This can be a time when you need a pivot: not quite a 180, but more than a tinker. Your new fill-in-the-blank might be designed not for clients, but for the people who can&rsquo;t afford you yet. Or it might be a deeper dive into a narrow portion of your expertise. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure your branding, your positioning and all of your collateral works for both audiences.</li><li> <strong>  You&rsquo;re busy talking about you. </strong>  The days when marketing was all about advertising your talents are O-V-E-R. You want to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to your client&mdash;on your website and in your social media and marketing pieces&mdash;as though you were having a conversation. How are their lives different after you&rsquo;ve worked your magic? What concrete results can they expect? What will the experience feel like? Show them what&rsquo;s possible instead of giving them a laundry list of your services and awards.</li><li> <strong>  Your competition looks&mdash;and reads&mdash;better than you. </strong>  When&rsquo;s the last time you web-surfed your competition? Take a look: how do your message and visual touch-points compare to what&rsquo;s out there? And be honest with yourself&mdash;how you pitch yourself to clients must match up with how you look and read. If you&rsquo;re pitching the high end of the food chain then you darned well better look like you&rsquo;re worth every penny. You deserve to occupy a unique space that speaks to your DNA and your sweet-spot clients.</li><li> <strong>  You&rsquo;re hard to find.  </strong> This will be your on-line death knell. It happens when your name or point of view is forgettable&mdash;just another &ldquo;me too&rdquo; message that gets lost when your client is ready to belly up to the bar. Or maybe your name is too similar to someone who&rsquo;s already staked their claim on your industry&rsquo;s google real estate&mdash;in that case, only new brand positioning is going to get you a break-through. Invest in building and maintaining your presence so you own your niche.</li><li> <strong>  Your brand is stuck in time. </strong>  Your website, your images (and especially photos), look like they&rsquo;re from 1997. Your clients will sense it even if they don&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t) articulate it. Overly formal copy, stiff head shots and multiple old-style fonts are the first signs that you&rsquo;re out of touch. Images that scream bad stock photography or are interchangeable with your competitors do you no favors (if I see one more financial advisory site with happy senior citizens strolling the beach, I might gag). Review your site and marketing collateral at least annually and make modern updates at least every couple of years&mdash;more often if you&rsquo;re making the kinds of changes in #1 and #2 above. <br/>  </li><p> A brand makeover requires some grit and a dose of courage. Don&rsquo;t commit until you&rsquo;re ready to set your stake in the ground&mdash;to claim a piece of territory as your own and commit to building (and defending) it.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not about a pretty website. It&rsquo;s about a core message that sparks connections, ideas, influence and revenue.</p>",

Recall if there is a common theme about new methodologies to achieve what you have in mind. Sometimes the traditional route is difficult whereas new thinking makes the journey a bit easier.</p><h3> Research</h3><p> <br/> Take time to research the methodologies that are mentioned frequently. This could lead you to the &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; to try.</p><h3> Peer</h3><p> <br/> Confidentially speak with the one person you admire. Reveal where you feel stuck or need added insight.

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can.&rdquo; &mdash;Frederick W. Smith</p><p> Leadership is about engaging, empowering, and inspiring others. But, what happens when the leader thinks he or she knows everything, treats employees like children, thinks he or she holds all the power, or is a control freak? I&rsquo;ll tell you what happens, operations start to experience a bottleneck; it slows everything down and prevents real progress. A byproduct of this bottle neck is low productivity, a poor work environment, and low employee morale. So, are you the bottleneck?</p><h3> Do you think you know everything?</h3><p> <br/> If you think you know everything, chances are you are the bottleneck. You can&rsquo;t do everything yourself and, just because you do it, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s done better than if someone else had done it. Being a leader does not mean that you know more than anyone else or that you are always right. In order to eliminate the bottleneck you need to understand your strengths and the strengths of those you work with. Then, get off your high horse and let others do what they are good at.</p><h3> Do you treat employees like children?</h3><p> <br/> If you are treating others like children, you increase the chances of them behaving like children. Your employees are adults; they don&rsquo;t need a babysitter. When you treat employees like children, you create a bottleneck. It&rsquo;s arrogant to think that employees are incapable of understanding the big picture; to only share the information that you deem necessary for them to know is showing a lack of respect for the value they can big to the organization. To not trust them to perform their work without a babysitter shows a lack of trust. To eliminate the bottleneck, hire capable employees and then make sure they have the tools, information, environment, support, and empowerment to do their jobs.</p><h3> Do you think you hold all the power?</h3><p> <br/> The number one reason employees quit is because they feel the work culture is toxic. This toxicity can most often be traced to a deficiency in leadership or the abuse of power by leaders. Abuse of power can cause a leader to become a bottleneck. You must empower employees to make the decisions and take the actions necessary to do their jobs effectively without you holding your power over every move they make. Your power will never motivate your employees; they are motivated by respect, control over their own work, recognition of value, and appreciation. To eliminate the bottleneck, even with the best of intentions, remember the quote by Lord Acton, &ldquo;Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&rdquo;</p><h3> Are you a control freak?</h3><p> <br/> Overbearing, micromanaging leaders prevent employees from plugging into their own power. If you are a control freak, your rules, bureaucratic hierarchy, and the fear you instill in your employees will cause a bottleneck. When employees can&rsquo;t make a decision or take an action without getting formal approval, obtaining a signature, or meeting with a committee, you&rsquo;ve definitely created a bottleneck. This prevents perfectly capable employees from doing the job they were hired to do. In order to eliminate the bottleneck, overcome your own insecurity, loosen the reins, give employees the tools they need, and delegate tasks to them. And then, TRUST them to take care of things on their own.</p><h3> Break Free from the Bottleneck</h3><p> <br/> When you think you know everything, treat employees like children, think you hold all the power, or are a control freak; it says more about you than it does about anyone else. No organization can function effectively with a bottleneck. So, don&rsquo;t blame your employees when the holdup is you! Learn to recognize YOUR behaviors that create the problem. And then, instead of being set on proving that you know more, can do more, and do it better than anyone else, act as the facilitator; provide the training and resources necessary for employees to do their job. And then, take pride in them doing it better than you.</p>",

This comes only a few months after the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-sec-is-reviewing-the-outsourced-ria-chief-compliance-officer-model\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC proposed a new rule in May that would require investment advisory firms to disclose if they utilize an outsourced CCO  </a> </u> .</p><p> It's evident that the SEC examination staff has been focused on better understanding the effectiveness of outsourced CCOs for quite some time. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/when-and-when-not-to-work-with-an-ria-compliance-consultant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA compliance consultants  </a> </u> , <strong>  we strongly believe that the CCO role should never be outsourced to a third party and have never taken on this role for any client. </strong> It is the crucial that a firm's CCO is properly empowered as a senior officer, has deep knowledge of the firm's business model and relevant risks, and is located on-site.</p><p> This latest risk alert notes that the the SEC OCIE staff recently conducted examinations of nearly 20 investment advisory firms that outsource their CCO role to \"unaffiliated third parties.\" Some of the risks of this model that the staff observed during these recent audits include:</p><li> <strong>  Communication: </strong> Some outsourced compliance officers did not appear to have enough personal communication with the firm to have a sufficient understanding of the firm's operations and associated risks.</li><li> <strong>  Resources: </strong> Third parties that served as a CCO for multiple firms with varying business models did not always enough resources and detailed knowledge to perform required compliance duties.</li><li> <strong>  Empowerment: </strong> Outsourced CCOs that did not independently obtain firm records to perform compliance reviews resulted in conducting inaccurate and insufficient reviews.</li><li> <strong>  Information gathering: </strong> Some 3rd party CCOs use standardized checklists to gather information and when inaccurate information was returned, the CCO did not have enough knowledge to identify the inconsistent information and properly follow-up.</li><li> <strong>  Insufficient Policies, Procedures, and Disclosures: </strong> Some firms utilizing an outsourced compliance officer did not sufficiently address all relevant conflicts of interest.</li><li> <strong>  Policies and Procedures were not Followed: </strong> At times, the 3rd party CCO did not properly review and identify when a firm's actual practices did not match the required policies and procedures.</li><li> <strong>  Policies and Procedures Manuals were not Tailored: </strong> Some compliance manuals were insufficient or not crafted for the relevant firm leading to critical compliance areas not being addressed.</li><li> <strong>  Insufficient Testing of the Compliance Program: </strong> Many firms were observed to have a lack of documentation evidencing proper testing.</li><li> <strong>  Limited Authority: </strong> Certain outsourced CCOs did not regularly visit the firm's office, had limited visibility into the organization, and thus were less equipped to drive needed compliance program changes. <br/>  </li><p> Even if not utilizing an outsourced CCO, we recommend that all RIA firm principals review this latest  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/ocie/announcement/ocie-2015-risk-alert-cco-outsourcing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   risk alert  </a> </u>  as there are a number of observations that are relevant to all investment advisory firms.</p>",

Your will has the power to ensure such wishes are met.</p><p> &bull; Dividing your estate up equally &mdash; In the event that you have more than one heir (e.g., a spouse and children), you can instruct to have your assets divided equally among everyone.</p><p> &bull;  <u>  Disinheriting </u>  your expected heirs &mdash; Alternatively, you can leave your heirs nothing.</p><p> &bull; Providing instructions should you become  <u>  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/incapacity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   incapacitated  </a> </u>  &mdash; You can even include in your will instructions for family members about what they should do if you should become mentally or physically incapacitated and unable to answer for yourself.</p><p> The will of  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Henry VIII  </u>    </a> of England is one of the most famous examples of how powerful a will can be.

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s autumn, which means that football season is in full swing, the leaves are turning colors, and employees throughout the country are taking part in open enrollment. Many are deciding, among other choices, whether to select a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/2015/07/14/employer-offers-hsa-fsa-whats-difference/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   health savings account (HSA) or a flexible spending account (FSA)  </a> </u> .Most people understand the advantages of setting aside pre-tax money to pay for medical expenses, but not as many people take advantage of the retirement savings aspects of these plans, which can bring a triple play of tax benefits.If you don&rsquo;t have an emergency fund, or if you anticipate a lot of health care expenses next year, you might want to prioritize saving for one or both of those before funding an HSA. But if you&rsquo;re relatively healthy and have money set aside for emergencies, HSA plans are a can&rsquo;t-miss savings option.</p><h3> Know the rules</h3>Before you can save in an HSA, you have to be eligible for one. To participate, your health insurance must be a high-deductible health plan. An HDHP has a deductible of at least $1,300 for an individual and $2,600 for a family, according to the IRS, though the average deductibles for these plans are a bit higher. An HSA user cannot be a dependent on another tax return or be eligible for Medicare.Like IRAs, HSAs have annual contribution limits. In 2016, an individual will be able to contribute up to $3,350, while a family can contribute up to $6,750 (these amounts include any employer contributions). If you turn 55 or older during the year, you can contribute an extra $1,000.Once you have an HSA, be sure your withdrawals are in line with the IRS guidelines for qualified medical expenses. Doctor or dentist visits, as well as prescription drugs, likely fall under this definition. Just make sure they occur after your HSA is officially open.<h3> Understand the tax advantages</h3>A closer look at HSAs reveals that they have unique advantages. You can roll over unused HSA funds into the following calendar year &mdash; and beyond &mdash; unlike FSA funds. Participants can also &ldquo;shoebox&rdquo; receipts. That&rsquo;s another way of saying you can document the qualified medical expenses you incur after opening your HSA and wait to withdraw that amount at a later date, tax-free &mdash; even during your retirement.To recap: An HSA participant can set aside money from a paycheck before that money is taxed, let the savings grow tax-deferred for years if necessary, and withdraw it tax-free to use for medical expenses. That&rsquo;s a tax &ldquo;triple saver.&rdquo;FSAs also offer tax-free saving and spending, but they have a lower contribution limit than HSAs, and in most cases, you must spend the balance of your account within the calendar year.<h3> Avoid missing out on investments</h3>Even though <u> <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/high-deductible-health-plans-on-the-rise/?utm_content=bufferc5b11&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1 in 4 workers are now enrolled </a></u> in a high deductible health insurance plan, many are leaving savings in the bank accounts within their HSA accounts earning very low interest rates. Others spend their balances the same year they deposit them. Of those making contributions, 80% had a distribution in the same year.If you&rsquo;re in either of these groups, you&rsquo;re missing one of the biggest opportunities of the HSA: investing the savings in stocks and mutual funds.Most HSAs have a brokerage account option, allowing you to invest your account in securities that have the potential for better long-term returns than a bank account. But you&rsquo;ll want to double check the fee structure, as some plans require a specific balance in the checking account portion to avoid a small monthly fee.By investing the savings in your HSA, you benefit from <u> compounding</u> returns.  So if you&rsquo;re using a diversified and <u> <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/investment-management/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  disciplined </a></u> investment strategy with your savings, you&rsquo;ll effectively have another retirement account. But through the end of 2014, <u> <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281636855_Health_Savings_Account_Balances_Contributions_Distributions_and_Other_Vital_Statistics_2014_Estimates_from_the_EBRI_HSA_Database\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  only 6% of HSA savers </a></u> had an associated brokerage account.If you have questions about your HSA, seek out a financial planner to help you make the right individual decision.Maximizing your opportunities within an HSA account may be one of the best gifts you make this holiday season.",

    "content": "<p> A client of mine recently told me about how he had dodged death twice. The story of the first time is especially hair-raising, but I must save it for another newsletter.</p><p> The second time this happened, it involved a seemingly innocuous growth on his arm. It looked like a mole, and he ignored it. He was so incredibily busy running his successful, global company that he hadn't seen his doctor in several years. He felt fine, and was in peak health by almost any external measure.</p><p> His doctor looked at the large mole on his arm and told him to see a dermatologist immediately&ndash;the same day. It turned out to be a melanoma that was on the verge of invading his body&ndash;of metastasizing. It was, in short, about to kill him (metastasized melanomas are highly lethal, according to doctors). </p><p> Here's the point: Your client relationship may seem healthy. Even radiant. But there may be something small bothering your client. It may be a benign issue&ndash;for now. But over time that concern may grow and even merge with other concerns. Your client's dissatisfaction can grow larger than the sum of the individual concerns. In other words, without regular communication and a thorough, annual client relationship review process, you risk losing a client because you were unaware of their true feelings or perhaps dismissed them in your mind.</p><p> You think it's a small, innocuous spot but it may grow into something more deadly. By the time you react to it, the relationship may be too ill to recover.</p><h3> Here are 10 Questions You Should Ask Each of Your Clients, Every Year <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Could you share with me your overall assessment of our relationship? </strong></p><p> This is a general question that can help kick off the conversation in a non-threatenng way.  </p><p> <strong>  2. What have we done recently that you have found particularly valuable or useful? </strong></p><p> We often think we know what has \"added value\" to our clients. But often, they have experienced value from things we've done that we thought were minor or insignificant. You need to find out, so ask!</p><p> <strong>  3. If you could change or improve one thing about our relationship, what would it be? </strong></p><p> If a client is not very forthcoming, this might spur an answer. </p><p> <strong>  4. Are there any individuals in your organization with whom we should invest more time and build a better relationship with? </strong></p><p> This question is especially important if you work with larger businesses where you need to be developing multiple relationships. </p><p> <strong>  5. Can you give me any suggestions for improving the amount, timing, or format of our communications to you and your organization? </strong></p><p> Ideally, you should co-create&ndash;that is, collaboratively define&ndash;the type of relationship management that suits the client. </p><p> Now you may want to shift towards several \"agenda setting\" questions to better understand your clients upcoming issues and challenges. Note: These are questions for existing clients, not a prospect. Agenda zetting questions for a prospect will be a little different. These assume a personal familiarity. </p><p> <strong>  6. What issues are coming up for you that we ought to be aware of or thinking about for you? </strong></p><p> <strong>  7. What are your plans for&hellip;? How are planning to deal with&hellip;? (tailor these to your client&rsquo;s business and markets) </strong></p><p> Remember, you don't just want to ask open-ended questions about your client's \"issues\"&ndash;you want to consistently demonstrate that you understand your client's business environment and the key trends that are affecting them. </p><p> <strong>  8. What are your two or three most important goals for next year? (Or, even better: How will you be evaluated by your leadership next year? What metrics will be used?) </strong></p><p> <strong>  9. As you think about the future of your business, and your various strategies and initiatives, what are you most excited about? Most concerned about? </strong></p><p> I like this because it's a \"right-brained\" power question. It will help you understand what your client is truly excited and passionate about in the business. </p><p> <strong>  10. Is there anything we could improve upon or change that would make doing business with us easier? </strong></p><p> \"Ease of doing business\" is an important and underrated concept, and you might close your conversation with this one. I've even said, to a busy top executives, \"Is there anything else I can do to make life easier for you?\"</p><p> <strong>  There are a few other questions you might also ask, depending on the circumstances. For example, if this is a firm relationship and you have a designated relationship manager and team, you need to find out how the client feels about them.  </strong></p><li> <strong>  Could you give me your assessment of our team? What have they done particularly well? Are there any areas for improvement or weakness I should be aware of? </strong></li><li> <strong>   Could you give me your assessment of our relationship manager/account executive? What are their strengths and weaknesses?  </strong></li><p> <strong>  And also: </strong></p><li> <strong>  If you need something from our organization, do you always know who to go to?  </strong></li><p> What if the problem with the relationship is the relationship partner or account manager? This doesn't happen every day, but I have witnessed this type of issue a number of times. An incompatible or poorly-performing team member is one thing; the wrong relationship manager is quite another. </p><p> Do clients know how to navigate your organization? Do they know exactly whom to turn to? The last question will help ferret that out, and what you learn may be very critical information.</p><p> <strong>  Finally: </strong>  once a year&ndash;probably in a separate conversation&ndash;you need to ask for a referral.  \"My business grows through word of mouth&mdash;can you think of anyone you know who would benefit from what I do?\" If possible, try and ask for a SPECIFIC referral&ndash;e.g, \"I'd really like to build a relationship with Bill Smith, who sits on the XYZ board with you&hellip;would you be willing to connect us?\"</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/jstackpool\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jim Stackpool  </u> </a>  </p><p> Is your advice firm striving to crack the &lsquo;High Net Worth&rsquo; market &ndash; i.e. rich people?</p><p> It&rsquo;s not getting a bit &lsquo;old-fashioned&rsquo; for advice firms is it?</p><p> I suppose if you use other people&rsquo;s money to make your money, the high net worth client is a logical focus. Similar to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton's_law\" target=\"_blank\">   bank robber  </a>  &lsquo; </u> s attraction to banks (i.e. follow the money!)</p><p> There are lot of reasons to focus on this market.</p><p> Apart from having lots of money, the high net worth client is usually accustomed to delegating.</p><p> The people with the big bucks often have the big houses, the big boats, big jobs or big businesses and take big holidays. They generally have greater propensity to use experts to better manage their life and all the &lsquo;big&rsquo; things in it. The high net worth market is accustomed to seeking out specific expertise. Thus, hard gained experience in tax, or structures, or underwriting, or property, or risk management, or stock-picking, is usually better rewarded.</p><p> <strong>  Being rich also really helps pay fees! </strong></p><p> Particularly if you charge by percentages of product where the maths and &lsquo;percentage game&rsquo; is more attractive at this end of the market. Small percentage gain in large assets enjoys larger consequences (and possible success fees?). Plus the on-going percentages of large risk premiums or assets can quickly fill the on-going renewal income nest for potentially years to come.</p><p> For some advisers, working with this market is also a status and reputation thing.</p><p> For advisers that like to brag about their big overseas holidays, or the number boards they sit on, or the expensive timepiece on their wrist or being a high bidder at the big corporate charity auctions, there&rsquo;s a certain kudos among some &lsquo;advisers&rsquo; being able to brag about their high net worth credentials. It seems to carry more reputation than the hard work with Centrelink pensioner clients.</p><p> In fact, the current &lsquo;advice&rsquo; industries obsession with the high net worth market has led a lot of Australians to believe that financial planning is only for rich people.</p><p> Or is it?</p><h3> Where&rsquo;s the value?</h3><p> <br/> Do you send your kids to the school where the primary focus is on their curriculum or their primary focus is on your kids?</p><p> Do you prefer the doctor who is the &lsquo;gun&rsquo; surgeon or who has the reputation of surgery only as the very last option after all other alternatives are fully considered?</p><p> Is the high net worth market still the ultimate proposition for financial advisory firms in 2014? Or is the term a throw-back to pre-GFC era when more consumers believed that the primary job of financial planners was the management of money and associated risks? Has that perception of the function of financial planners past it&rsquo;s peak just like traditional newpapers and their ability to attract advertising?</p><p> Consider school fees.</p><p> Why do so many Australian families willingly go into debt to put their kids into expensive schools when cheaper and good alternatives are often available? Obviously they perceive value. How many Australians today knowingly go into similar debt to get great but expensive financial advice? It&rsquo;s almost unheard of, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> Does the whole financial advice industry need a re-invention to deliver advice whose value could parallel expensive school fees? Could it ever be possible that one day &lsquo;middle or low&rsquo; net worth clients might see the value in great financial advice and, like expensive school fees, actually begin to better understand that possibly even having to go into debt to pay advice fees might be the best debt they have ever considered?</p><p> I don&rsquo;t believe those firms that specialise in the &lsquo;net worth market&rsquo; are going to be early adopters of these new propositions. It&rsquo;s a bridge too far for their beliefs and experiences that reinforce their current approach to deal mostly with &lsquo;rich&rsquo; people. Without experience, or more importantly confidence, in the &lsquo;pure&rsquo; advice market without reliance on lots of money (i.e. product), making good consistent profits from people who aren&rsquo;t high net worth seems too hard and isn&rsquo;t impossible.</p><p> Is it possible that ordinary Australians will come to value advice and the fee associated or will it always only be valued by the &lsquo;high net worth&rsquo; and other &lsquo;rich&rsquo; people.</p><p> Or is it time to start experimenting? Maybe consider removing your &lsquo;expertise in the high net worth&rsquo; market off your web site? Maybe replace it with an authentic advice expertise that you really believe in and wish to be known as an expert in? Is that a possibility, to actually get paid for YOUR specific expertise with people rather than your preceived expertise with their money?</p><p> What do you reckon?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> More and more companies are using their websites to build their contact lists and attract new customers. Companies are moving past reliance on the &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; link and doing other things to get people interested in their products and services.</p><p> How effective is your online  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/lead-generation-lead-nurturing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lead generation campaign  </a> </u> ? How many of these leads result in actual paying customers? It takes a lot of effort and a combination of techniques to find highly-converting leads. Here are six actionable lead generation ideas you can start using today using email, social media, blogging, warm calling and more.</p><p> Learn what goes into an online B2B lead generation campaign:</p><h3> 1. Capture Emails, Build Relationships and Then Sell</h3><p> <br/> On average,  <u>  <a href=\"http://conversionxl.com/ridiculously-effective-technique-for-online-lead-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   95 percent  </a> </u>  of visitors to your site won&rsquo;t make a purchase on their first visit. In the B2B world, conversion rates are even lower because there are fewer conversion opportunities on the website.  This means that trying to sell to your prospect right away using your website won&rsquo;t be effective. The web is a research tool for your buyers and influencers, so it&rsquo;s essential for you to capture their emails and nurture a relationship with them first before trying to sell them anything.</p><p> <strong>  Start today: </strong>  Offering the ability to subscribe to blogs by email, or at least sign up for a newsletter, is a great way to start building your list. Reduce attrition by sending helpful information by email on a regular basis.</p><h3> 2. Social Listening on Social Media Platforms</h3><p> <br/> Carrying out a quick search on social media platforms will help you find people who are actively talking about your company, products, related products, your competitors, or what is going on in your industry in real time. Reach out to these people and actively engage them.</p><p> <strong>  Start today: </strong>  Unless you already have access to applications that let you monitor certain social media channels, start by reading up on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/linkedin-industry-groups-b2b-lead-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   industry groups on LinkedIn  </a> </u>  and join in the conversation.</p><h3> 3. Blogging and Testimonials</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve written before about the value of coming up with a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/create-content-marketing-blueprint/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content calendar  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/case-study-business-blogging-improves-website-traffic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blogging on a regular basis  </a> </u> . Include testimonials and case studies as social proof that your products work and your customers are satisfied. Once your audience sees that you have successfully helped your current clients, they will be more willing to make a purchase from you.</p><p> <strong>  Start today: </strong>  While testimonials and customer quotes are great for your public-facing website, you might opt to save detailed case studies for later in the buying process after you learn about your buyers&rsquo; situations.</p><h3> 4. Provide Value to Your Clients Before the Sale</h3><p> <br/> At first, provide your prospects with lots of helpful information without asking for anything in return. Once you have established a good reputation with them, sell them a great product. Chances are high that they will make a purchase, since they will trust your recommendations.</p><p> <strong>  Start today: </strong>  If possible, it&rsquo;s better to have a two-way dialog with your prospects and early stage leads. Find out what problems they are trying to solve and send them information that relates to their problems. Then you&rsquo;re helping, not selling, but furthering the sale.</p><h3> 5. Micro-Conversion Strategies</h3><p> <br/> Very few people are going to fill out a contact form on your &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; page. Why? What do you expect when you fill out a contact form on a service provider&rsquo;s website? A call from a sales person? Exactly.</p><p> If very few people fill out a form on your &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; page, you have to find low-commitment ways for them to interact with your company. Provide a lot of opportunities on your website for your prospects to convert. This includes providing  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/white-paper-lead-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   downloadable resources  </a> </u>  e.g. e-books, webinars and white papers, which prospects can only access after providing their email address.</p><p> <strong>  Tip: </strong>  Don&rsquo;t put everything behind a lead form. Offer helpful content like videos and infographics on your website that people can view without filling in a form, too.</p><h3> 6. Warm Calling</h3><p> <br/> Research more about your prospects before reaching out to them. Know who you are calling and how you can be of help to them.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/the-abusive-math-of-cold-calling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Warm calling  </a> </u>  as a result of a referral or web lead increases your chances of conversion by up to 40 percent.</p><p> <strong>  Start today:  </strong> You might want to purchase a premium account on LinkedIn to give you enhanced capabilities as you research your web leads and referrals.</p><p> Using a combination of various lead generation techniques will increase your chances of converting your business leads. This will result in more sales revenue for your business.</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/2015-smart-goals-template?__hssc=268771694.6.1428521396228&amp;__hstc=268771694.18009a5f9af1d238e22b76f82bce9879.1423065135297.1428507462440.1428521396228.15&amp;hsCtaTracking=28142114-de2f-48dc-93b1-ec1506a64f39%7C6b878b33-3859-4821-ba23-fff6eebe0459\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-marketing-template_3_0.png\" width=\"390\"/> </a></p>",

Women save 7 percent of pay, compared with 6.8 percent for men, controlling for wages, job tenure, and plan design. They also save at higher rates than men at every income level.</p><p> Her findings also refute the old wive&rsquo;s tale that women don&rsquo;t like risky investing.</p><p> Both men and women hold roughly three-fourths of their retirement accounts in the stock market.

    "title": "The “Write Good Content\" Myth",
    "link": "the-write-good-content-myth",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> There&rsquo;s a common misconception among many business owners and some marketers that SEO has become easier the past couple of years &ndash; that &ldquo;good content&rdquo; can substitute for, or replace, search engine optimization (SEO).</h3>Although this idea has been around for sometime, it understandingly gained momentum and traction in late 2013, after Google introduced the <u> Hummingbird algorithm</u>.It has since been perpetuated by countless blog articles, ads, and social media discussions &ndash; like the one below from an Insurance Marketing Google+ community.<a href=\"http://brentcarnduff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/final.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Content Marketing Myth\" src=\"http://brentcarnduff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/final.png\"/></a>Just to clarify &ndash; I&rsquo;m a strong proponent of using content, particularly blog posts and video, to market your business online &ndash; blogging and video are among the best SEO tools available to most small businesses. In addition, Brett&rsquo;s suggestion of creating content around client questions and interviews is great advice, particularly in light of hummingbird &ndash; but it should be as part of an overall SEO strategy, rather than in place of it.Suggesting otherwise either reveals a limited understanding of SEO &ndash; this is not meant to be a criticism of Brett, Joey, Jason or Brian (from above discussion), they are insurance experts trying to help each other market their businesses &ndash; or worse, represents an attempt to mislead the reader.<h3> Why &ldquo;Content&rdquo; Alone is Not Enough</h3><strong> 1. Competition: </strong>More businesses are waking up to the importance of content creation for marketing and are producing more content everyday. Assuming that some of your competitors are also capable of creating &ldquo;good content&rdquo;, what is going to differentiate you in the eyes of the search engines? It will be ranking signals such as keyword choice and use, meta data, authority signals, and technical indicators (loading speed, mobile friendly, etc) &ndash; all part of Search Engine Optimization.<strong> 2. Backlinks: </strong>While Google has become better at identifying high quality links &ndash; disregarding or even penalizing the low quality backlinks that were so abused a few years ago &ndash; backlinks are still the most powerful signal of a website&rsquo;s authority, and &ldquo;authority&rdquo; is an important ranking signal.Proponent&rsquo;s of the &ldquo;Good Content&rdquo; myth counter the backlink argument with these two points:<li> Good Content will Attract Backlinks: this is Google&rsquo;s stance, and while a nice thought, it does not reflect the reality of most industries. Within the marketing/SEO industry, many writer&rsquo;s link out to other content, creating backlink signals for that content. However, how many advisors, realtors, or plumbers, link out to other authors or blogs? Not many, in fact a very small number of people create the majority of links within most industries. Rand Fishkin labeled this group the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/identifying-the-linkerati\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   linkerati  </a> </u> &ldquo;, and it is important that you identify and attract the attention of this group, or develop your own community, to build/attract backlinks to your content.</li><li> Social Media Signals: there is a lot of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.leapfroggr.com/social-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   confusion around social media and SEO  </a> </u> . Although social media can be a great marketing tool, one that can indirectly benefit your SEO, social signals (likes, +1s, shares) are not ranking signals, nor are social media links the same as other backlinks.  <u>  <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/social-media-as-your-primary-link-building-tactic-probably-wont-work-whiteboard-friday\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social media cannot  </a> </u>  substitute for an SEO strategy.</li><strong> 3. Website vs. Blog Content: </strong>Many discussions around SEO and Content focus on blog content. While blog articles can be an important source for broad or long-tail keyword optimization, internal linking, and link building, they are not the only content on your website. The pages on your site, particularly your homepage and Product/Service pages, need to be optimized for search. They usually represent your business/industries broadest and most competitive keywords. For the majority of websites, the homepage is the most authoritative page &ndash; relying simply on &ldquo;good content&rdquo; is a very risky strategy on these pages.<strong> 4. Local SEO: </strong>For any business that relies on local foot, phone, or web traffic for revenue, local optimization is a must. Local rankings are highly reliant on very specific signals. Although &ldquo;good content&rdquo; can support and amplify these signals, the signals must be in place.<strong> 5. Technical SEO:</strong> Technical SEO has increased in importance and complexity over the past couple of years. From helping to determine <u> <a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/online-marketing/keyword-research-website-design-01084764\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  what pages to include in your site </a></u>, to making sure that site loads quickly and is mobile friendly, to managing user experience, and creating content silos, SEO solves issues that &lsquo;write good content&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t address.<strong> 6. Google is amazing, but . . . : </strong>Yes, Google is definitely getting better at identifying related keywords, understanding context, and determining a user&rsquo;s intent, BUT . . . its still far from perfect.For example, a real estate site that I&rsquo;m helping currently ranks 14th for Henderson Property Management, but 43rd for Property Management Henderson, two terms that use the exact same 3 words and describe the same service, yet Google doesn&rsquo;t see them the same. I see this all of the time with Finanical Advisor sites as well. An advisors site might rank high for Financial Advisor, but not for Financial Planner, or visa versa. Google is still dependent on keyword selection and optimization for ranking.<h3> Conclusion</h3>I&rsquo;m not suggesting every blog article needs to be the result of keyword research, or that your writing should be stuffed with keywords. You may identify and target some specific keywords that you want to rank for, but ultimately your content should address the interests and needs of your readers. In doing so, you will naturally cover the topics that are important to your industry and readers, and address many different keywords that will help draw traffic &ndash; but don&rsquo;t stop there. Developing &ldquo;good content&rdquo; is a time consuming task &ndash; don&rsquo;t waste your time or content. Use search engine optimization to amplify your content, website, and products/services to the search engines and your audience &ndash; good content alone is not enough.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Did you ever have a call with a prospect where you just came away with this really bad feeling ? And in spite of that ominous feeling, you just continued to chase the deal anyway ? Did it go anywhere ? And if it did, did that prospect turn out to be a great client ?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re anything like me (and 99% of my clients), the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p><p> Fact: bad sales prospects waste our time, don&rsquo;t buy, and if they do they&rsquo;re almost always more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth.</p><p> But the problem is:  how do you figure out which ones are bad prospects in the first place ?  I mean, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a checklist somewhere &ndash; or is there ?</p><p> Over the years, I&rsquo;ve finetuned my &ldquo;bad prospect radar&rdquo; to the point where I can spot one a mile away. They typically give off the same warning signs &ndash; all you need to know is how to look for them.</p><p> With that in mind, here are 6 signs you&rsquo;re dealing with a prospect you don&rsquo;t want to do business with.</p><h3> <strong>  1. They&rsquo;re unresponsive. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Listen. Everyone&rsquo;s busy. I get it. And no one likes to get calls 4-5 times per day from eager sellers asking them &ldquo;how things are going&rdquo;. Which means most prospects will play &ldquo;hide and seek&rdquo; to a certain degree. And that&rsquo;s fine.</p><p> But there&rsquo;s a certain category of sales prospects that takes this to the extreme. After the first call, they seem to drop off the face of the planet. Your emails go unanswered. Calls divert to voicemail. (And let&rsquo;s really hope you haven&rsquo;t take the time to draft an elaborate proposal at this point).</p><p> In my experience,  unresponsive prospects turn into unresponsive clients . Which is a recipe for disaster.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve got a clear set of rules in place for this crowd. I&rsquo;ll reach out once. Twice. A third time. And then, I&rsquo;m done. Three strikes and you&rsquo;re out.</p><h3> <strong>  2. They&rsquo;re transactional. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I was sitting in a meeting room sometime last year, when a senior executive stood up, pounded his hand on the table and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of all this talk about building long-term relationships with our clients. In my business, long-term relationships are built one deal at a time&rdquo;. (He was a high-powered commodities trader).</p><p> For him, that&rsquo;s fine. But if, like me, you&rsquo;re in a services business, you DO want to build long term relationships with clients. But a long term relationship has to go both ways. It&rsquo;s hard to build something lasting by yourself.</p><p> If I&rsquo;m running into a prospect who only wants to talk about the current deal, doesn&rsquo;t leave openings for discussing the longer term and focuses only or mainly on price &ndash; warning lights start to go off.</p><h3> <strong>  3. They&rsquo;re cheap. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whether by necessity or by choice, some sales prospects want the moon for the price of a Super Saver meal at your local burger joint. They&rsquo;ll happily talk to you all day long, scoping out a world-class program, to then turn around and say &ldquo;So. I&rsquo;ve got 5K to spend. Would that about cover it ?&rdquo;</p><p> Some people don&rsquo;t have an eye for value &ndash; they focus on cost, and cost alone. That doesn&rsquo;t make them bad. It just means that, if you&rsquo;re a premium player, you most definitely don&rsquo;t want to do business with them.</p><p> Either they come around and you&rsquo;ll agree on a more reasonable number. Or it&rsquo;s better to kill the deal right then and there.</p><h3> <strong>  4. They&rsquo;re irrational. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When I was about 20, I had this girlfriend. She was beautiful. Long blond hair. Big blue eyes. Lots of fun. The works. Trouble was she was about as stable as a case of dynamite. The slightest thing could set her off. Needless to say, things didn&rsquo;t last for very long.</p><p> Some prospects behave in similar ways. They don&rsquo;t make decisions rationally. Refuse to commit to anything. Remain unclear around their decision making criteria, and do so on purpose. Change their mind on a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p><p> If I spot a prospect like that, I steer clear. If they&rsquo;re behaving that way before the deal is done, imagine what they&rsquo;d be like  after  they become a client.</p><h3> <strong>  5. They&rsquo;re overly demanding. </strong></h3><p> <br/> So I got this email the other day from a potential prospect. Couple of bulletpoints about their situations, and perceived need. Then, they asked for a proposal, outlining &ndash; in great detail &ndash; everything they wanted to know about (including, by the way, three names of past clients). Pulling everything together would have take me a few hours, at least.</p><p> My answer ? No. I&rsquo;m not going to send you a proposal.</p><p> Unless you are ready to spend an hour on the phone with me, I will not send a proposal (and even then, I often won&rsquo;t &ndash; not unless I have a clear understanding of what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish, why it matters and what the impact looks like).</p><p> Contrary to popular knowledge, sales is a balance equation. Your job is not simply to &ldquo;serve your clients&rdquo;. There needs to be a little give-and-take from both sides. Which includes information, effort and energy.</p><p> I typically know when I&rsquo;m dealing with an overly demanding prospect if they:</p><li> Ask for a lot of information, yet refuse to share anything in return themselves</li><li> Don&rsquo;t respond to my requests for information and/or send me the bare minimum as a &ldquo;pacifier&rdquo;</li><li> Aren&rsquo;t willing to do some work and invest some time in the process themselves (eg. by drafting a scoping document)</li><li> Aren&rsquo;t willing to exchange on an even balance (e.g. I&rsquo;ll work out a full proposal, if you agree to co-present it to management) <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  6. They&rsquo;re indecisive. </strong></h3><p> <br/> You know the type. When they&rsquo;re on the phone, they&rsquo;re ready to commit. Half an hour later, you get an email, stating &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve changed their mind&rdquo; (often including some vague excuse about their boss, circumstances or a universal culprit like &ldquo;the strategy&rdquo;).</p><p> Truth is: they can&rsquo;t commit. Or they don&rsquo;t want to.</p><p> Whatever the case, I don&rsquo;t want to deal with them. Great clients are action-takers. They don&rsquo;t need to be convinced of &ldquo;the case for change&rdquo;, or when they do it takes very little. They want to move the needle. They&rsquo;re ambitious. And they&rsquo;re not afraid to take you along for the ride.</p><p> Many of my clients lament the fact that &ldquo;some of their sellers seem to work so hard, yet accomplish so little.&rdquo; When I press deeper, I often find out that it&rsquo;s not that they can&rsquo;t get the prospect to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s that they can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the wrong prospect. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago when we would call a travel agent up when we wanted to book air travel and visit a music store when we wanted to hear the latest release from our favourite band.</p><p> In less than 30 years, digital technology has completely refashioned how we consume travel services and music products, along with a host of other consumer goods and services. Increasingly, we search online and book our own travel, from the airline &ldquo;tickets&rdquo; to the small B&amp;Bs in the places we visit. And more and more of us are subscribing to music services, effectively renting access to our favourite music rather than buying and owning copies of it.</p><p> How a vast array of consumer products and services are conceived, marketed and sold to us as consumers has undergone a radical transformation in the digital age. Plummeting technology and communication costs has placed powerful mobile devices in our hands that have completely changed how we get information, stay connected with others and entertain ourselves.</p><p> This digital revolution has largely impacted the back-offices of the financial services industry, but it has notably sidestepped the distribution systems. Virtually every major financial product or service is supported by digital back-end systems. Yet, the marketing and sales of many products, such as investments and insurance, continues to be carried out through a legacy distribution system consisting of advisors, agents and salespeople.</p><p> However, all of this is about to change dramatically. The revolutionary transformation that digital technology has triggered in consumer businesses is about to be felt in financial services businesses.</p><p> In this article and presentation, I will try to explain WHY digital technology undermines the prevailing business strategy of the past 30-40 years and HOW financial services firms as well as individual advisors and agents can adapt their businesses to the realities of the new digital age of financial services.</p><p> This article is also available as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jaypalter/how-to-survive-and-thrive-in-the-digital-age-of-financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Slideshare presentation  </a> </u>  if you prefer a more visual experience.</p><h3> A brief personal history of digital technology</h3><p> <br/> Digital technology is not new. If you&rsquo;re anywhere near my age, you&rsquo;ve been on this planet as long as some of the early, transformative digital technology. (Go ahead and skip this part if you already know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I just like reminiscing about the good old days of over-priced, under-performing computer hardware.)</p><p> THINK. I always loved that slogan.</p><p> The IBM System 360 mainframe computer appeared in 1964 and became the digital foundation of many of the early, automated systems for managing large amounts of data in government and industry. My dad&rsquo;s first job after university was with IBM and I can clearly recall the iconic IBM &ldquo;THINK&rdquo; sign in our house as I was growing up.</p><p> In junior high school, I elected the computer programming course option. This consisted of penciling in bubbles on cardboard cards that, at the end of each class, got boxed up and sent downtown to the board of education&rsquo;s VAX computer for processing. The following week, we would get the printout of our  <u>  <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/basic-the-50-year-old-computer-programming-language-fo-1570417052\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BASIC  </a> </u>  program and begin the debugging process. After that experience, I decided that computer programming wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p><p> With the appearance of affordable personal computers in the 1980s, typewriters began to be replaced by much more flexible word processors (remember WordStar?) for writing and composing communications. But for me, it was the combination of the PC with the early Internet in the late 1980s that opened up the world.</p><p> Working for a global ecological non-profit group at the time, we were using portable PCs (Kaypros) combined with Internet access (mostly via landline modem, but sometimes by satellite) to coordinate advocacy campaigns internationally. State-of-the-science information and research in, say, Germany could be quickly transmitted around the world and be used to support environmental policy changes in Canada and the US. In many situations, this kept us a few steps ahead of our corporate and government adversaries.</p><p> The Kaypro keyboard could be clipped onto the CPU box so you could carry (lug) it around.</p><p> By the 1990s, I had found my entrepreneurial self and was training people on how to use the emerging Internet strategically to get access to information and advance their businesses. This morphed into a website development business as the more visual World Wide Web came together later in the decade.</p><p> Which brings us to the last couple of decades in which we have seen the rapid evolution of a whole series of digital consumer technology, including:</p><li> cell phones to smart phones (which are less like phones and more like powerful computers with voice capabilities);</li><li> personal computers, to laptops and notebooks and now mobile touch-screen tablets;</li><li> various audio systems for playing digital recordings to subscription-based streaming audio services;</li><li> cable television to subscription-based streaming entertainment. <br/>  </li><p> Just to mention a few.</p><p> For me, the idea of adapting to the technology of the time is a concept that goes back to the 1980s. I earn my living today consulting on strategies and activities that not only did not exist 30 years ago, but could barely be imagined.</p><h3> Digital technology is undermining traditional business strategy</h3><p> <br/> As we have seen, digital technology has triggered some fundamental changes to business models in a variety of consumer businesses in the past 30 years. Yet, there are a number of other businesses, an example of which is financial services, that haven&rsquo;t really been fundamentally impacted yet &ndash; at least, the foundational business model of distribution hasn&rsquo;t been impacted yet.</p><p> This is about to change.</p><p> Philip Evans of Boston Consulting Group has argued (in  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business#t-16605\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this TED talk  </a> </u> ) that the digital age of connected systems and vast amounts of data has changed the world in such a way as to undermine the fundamental tenets of business strategy in place since the 1970s. His argument goes like this.</p><p> Modern business strategy is largely reducible to two main theories:</p><li> economies of scale; and</li><li> vertical value chains. <br/>  </li><p> Economies of scale strategies basically work like this: if you combine two or more businesses into a larger business, you can reduce the costs of production and increase profitability.</p><p> Vertical value chains are the result of businesses aligning themselves vertically to manufacture and distribute products and services to a market. When these separate businesses amalgamate into one vertically integrated company, it is more cost-effective, and therefore more profitable, to bring products and services to market. This is because each link in a vertical value chain has transaction costs, which are largely costs associated with information processing and communication, and those costs can be reduced and made more efficient inside a larger vertically-integrated entity.</p><p> The thing is, in the past 20 years, these information processing and communication costs have been plummeting. This chart from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mary Meeker&rsquo;s KPCB Internet Trends presentation  </a> </u>  clearly illustrate how inexpensive it has become to compute (as well as store and transmit data) compared to 20 or 30 years ago.</p><p> <img alt=\"meeker-computing-costs-1990-2013\" src=\"http://jaypalter.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/meeker-computing-costs-1990-2013.png\"/></p><p> Evans&rsquo; argument is that as these transaction costs have fallen, vertical value chains have uncoupled and begun to re-form horizontally.</p><h3> Horizontal value chains explain a lot</h3><p> <br/> If we look back at music sales from the 1970s to present (see chart below), we can observe that despite the precipitous drop in vinyl record sales, overall growth in music sales was maintained and even grown by cassette and CD sales into the early 2000s. But music sales have been in decline since then.</p><p> <img alt=\"music-sales\" src=\"http://jaypalter.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/music-sales1.png\"/></p><p> What is notable about this chart is the appearance of Apple (&ldquo;iTunes&rdquo; in the chart), a digital technology company known for personal computers and mobile devices such as the iPod music player. Apple&rsquo;s appearance as a dominant player in the music industry as it digitizing is an example of this disruption of traditional, vertical value chains in the music business. Apple leveraged its existing customer-base and distribution platform to become a key player in the digital music business.</p><p> This scenario can be generalized in reference to the digitization of financial services.</p><p> Businesses with existing digital business models, widespread distribution systems, and/or a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty are the ones that increasingly see financial services markets as desirable to enter.</p><p> These &ldquo;new market entrants&rdquo;, as they are sometimes called by financial market observers, can include established businesses, such as:</p><li> <strong>  Retail  </strong> companies (eg., Walmart, Costco and Amazon, etc.) that have large retail operations with sophisticated logistical capabilities and widespread distribution networks;</li><li> <strong>  Technology </strong>  companies (eg., Google, Apple and Facebook) that have loyal customers and considerable expertise in digital technology innovation; and</li><li> <strong>  Media </strong>  conglomerates (eg., GE, Disney and Viacom in the US and Rogers and CTVglobemedia in Canada) that have already undergone significant horizontal integration in the past two decades. <br/>  </li><p> Of course, these &ldquo;new market entrants&rdquo; may also include to the hundreds of financial technology (referred to  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fintech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   on Twitter as #fintech  </a> </u> ) companies sprouting up all over the world, fuelled by a  <u>  venture capital frenzy </u> .</p><p> Existing financial services businesses, such as banks, insurance and investment companies, are also eying new areas of financial services where they can branch out horizontally into areas of financial services that offer synergies with existing lines of business.</p><h3> Implications for financial service providers today</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re following the argument so far, you will recognize that this is not merely some sort of cyclical restructuring of the financial services industry. Rather, the digital technology forces at play are in the midst of a fundamental rethinking of the financial services industry and its foundational business models. Technologies like the blockchain, which has revealed itself as the building block of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, is poised to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/eb1f8256-7b4b-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html?segid=0100320#axzz3qK4rCVQP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fundamentally disrupt the monetary system  </a> </u> .</p><p> In virtually every other digital disruption in the past 30 years, so-called &ldquo;middlemen&rdquo; in the value chain have been cut out. Distributors of recorded music products have gone out of business or had to expand and offer a broader range of products. Travel agents that brokered airline tickets have gone out of business and been replaced with specialized travel service companies that add unique value to the digitally-empowered consumer of travel services.</p><p> Most financial advisors and insurance agents have their compensation largely tied to the sale or ongoing maintenance of financial products, such as investments or insurance. It is this distribution model for financial products that is the target of an explosion of many fintech plays.</p><p> This is a sensitive point in an industry like insurance, where the manufacturers of products depend on the current advisor force to sell their products, yet these same manufacturers are also wary of the new market entrants that are threatening to market directly to consumers, going around the traditional advisor/agent distribution systems. In other words, the drive to direct-to-market solutions is a trend that is bigger than the insurance company whose products advisors and agents sell and threatens the insurance manufacturers&rsquo; very existence as much as its distributors&rsquo;. The direct-to-market strategies of insurance or investment companies are motivated by their survival first and foremost, not about cutting out advisors.</p><h3> How to position your business for the digital age</h3><p> <br/> But that raises the question for advisors: How can you position yourself strategically in the face of such fundamental re-engineering of the business model of financial services and financial product distribution?</p><p> Growing your business simply isn&rsquo;t going to give you the benefit it might have in the past, because new market entrants and entrepreneurial start-ups are leveraging digital technology to undercut not just your business, but your business model. These new market entrants are not encumbered by old-school thinking, nor by legacy computer systems, old-fashioned business processes or poor digital skills.</p><p> There are some very smart marketers out there that want to help you differentiate your brand and leverage digital technology more effectively &ndash; and you&rsquo;re smart to pay attention to them. But marketing alone isn&rsquo;t going to rescue your business from the coming digital disruption.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not innovating and fundamentally rethinking your business model and the core value proposition your service offering to clients, your digital marketing strategy is merely moving your chairs on the Titanic.</p><h3> Focus on lifetime value of relationships</h3><p> <br/> Advisors and advisory businesses that want to position themselves strongly and profitably for the digital age need to focus on their most valuable asset &ndash; client relationships.</p><p> Your existing clients have already chosen to do business with you and you&rsquo;ve earned their trust. If you&rsquo;re really good, your clients have a deep connection to you and your firm and are highly engaged in the relationship too.</p><p> The lifetime value of a client relationship is sometimes used to convey the enormous business benefits that come from servicing and retaining clients over long periods of time &ndash; even a lifetime. Client retention is a growth driver for many businesses and deep client engagement can drive referrals and greater sales.</p><p> In the digital age, we also need to look at lifetime value from the client&rsquo;s perspective and position services so that they  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneysummit.mx.com/the-summit/2015/3/13/bradley-leimer-interview-empowering-lifelong-customer-relationships-in-a-digital-world\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   provide the client with lifetime value  </a> </u>  as well. We need to focus on our clients&rsquo; life goals and help them make life decisions in the service of those goals.</p><p> Applying this concept of lifetime value to the advisor-client relationship, there are a number of essential areas that financial services businesses need to focus on in order to survive and thrive in the digital era.</p><h3> 1. DIGITIZE your client relationships &ndash; your most valuable business asset.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s hard to be an advice provider and not acknowledge the importance of the advisor-client relationship to your business success. Yet few existing financial services businesses are fully leveraging digital tools effectively to add value to and derive value from those relationships. Here are the questions you should be asking about your business:</p><h3> a. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h3><p> Do you have a digital CRM system? CRM systems are needed to keep track of client details and ensure that there is an accessible record of interactions between the client and the practice. If a team is servicing the client, team members need to have all relevant details and history at their fingertips. Also, a CRM can help you manage compliance obligations while giving you a more complete picture of your client&rsquo;s financial and life situation. While CRMs have been around since the 1980s, far too many financial advisory practices do not have reliable and secure digital systems for managing customer data.</p><h3> b. Client data</h3><p> Are you leveraging client data effectively? Data abounds in the digital age and most financial services businesses are barely scratching the surface of incorporating that data into their sales and service efforts. Tracking basic financial data, such as what you would collect for a typical financial plan, can reveal gaps and opportunities to serve clients better. Advisory practices that have digital systems in place to collect, track and analyze client data can easily identify many opportunities within existing books of business to serve clients better while growing their businesses.</p><h3> c. Cross-selling</h3><p> Do you have a mechanism for cross selling? Most financial advisory businesses today are based on managing one aspect of a client&rsquo;s financial needs &ndash; for example, investments or insurance. However, your clients have other needs for financial products and services, such as travel insurance, property and casualty coverage, and banking services, just to mention a few. A cross-selling platform would enable you to partner with other vendors and service providers and leverage your relationships to offer your clients additional services.</p><h3> d. Security</h3><p> Are you protecting your client&rsquo;s security? The majority of advisory businesses are communicating with their clients using mobile devices to send and receive emails and text messages. With growing risks of hackers gaining access to online communications, it is critically important to take every precaution to prevent personal and private client data from being exposed. This is a serious business risk that many advisory businesses are not well equipped to manage.</p><h3> 2. PARTNER with everyone &ndash; Add value by broadening your offering, building partnerships and engaging your clients.</h3><p> <br/> Broadening your service offering and serving more of your clients&rsquo; needs is key to surviving in the digital age of financial services. Here are some things you should be thinking about:</p><h3> a. Partner with your clients</h3><p> The first partnership in your advisory business should be between you and your client. Stop thinking about transactions and seek to build a partnership with your clients. If you are attuned to your clients&rsquo; situations, it will be clear that they have needs that are outside your area of expertise.</p><h3> b. Financial concierge</h3><p> Are you training your clients to use you as a concierge? Clients that have dealt with you only as an investment or insurance advisor for many years may not be used to thinking of you in a broader, more holistic, service context. You should be training your clients to come to you to help them find the products, services and/or expertise they need for a wide variety of needs. This is not only about messaging, but also about developing the tools to broker these types of referrals relationships.</p><h3> c. Partnering with peers</h3><p> Are you complementing your core services and partnering with other subject matter experts? If you take seriously the notion of providing lifetime value to your clients, then you should be striving to help them find the best people to complement your services. Building a dream team of advisors for your clients both helps you serve them better and build a more viable long-term value package for retaining your clients.</p><h3> d. Partnering with your community</h3><p> Your clients are people, like you. They live in communities. They have families and are often parents. They are interested not only in their own lives and financial affairs, but in making life better for others in their community. You should be aligning your business with causes that improve the community and address the communal aspirations of your clients. This is also an effective way to build engagement and support among your staff.</p><h3> 3. BE your brand &ndash; Make digital communications a core competency of your business.</h3><p> <br/> In the digital age, every business is a communications business. The tools of communication &ndash; reporting, publishing, broadcasting and distribution technology &ndash; that were once the dominion of large media organizations are now available to any and every business, virtually for free. You need to be thinking about these questions in terms of how your business communicates:</p><h3> a. Are you helping?</h3><p> Are you helping clients and prospects find helpful information online? More than half of the buyer&rsquo;s journey is happening online before that person shows up in your office or at an event or in your sales funnel. Prospects are doing their own online research and you need to provide helpful resources to guide them in their journey.</p><h3> b. Are you engaging?</h3><p> Are you savvy in how to conduct relationships online? Social networks are often called the social telephone because the conversations that are happening online are often replacing other types of communication. You and your business need to be present and helpful where your clients and prospects are having conversations about their lives and their needs. Savvy social businesses realize there is much to learn from just listening and engaging.</p><h3> c. Are you being a social seller? </h3><p> Social networks are not all about (or even mostly about) marketing. They are ALL about relationships. Social sellers learn how to use online social networking to share helpful information, engage in relationship-building conversations and hone their professional reputations. Social businesses train their people in the art of social selling and support them with information and resources to share.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> While these suggestions are by no means exhaustive, but they point in the right direction. The need to embrace digital technology and innovation in financial services, to listen to markets and build partnerships that serve them, and to master the art of human communication in the age of social business &ndash; these imperatives will only increase with the passage of time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Happiness is that elusive state-of-mind that even the most upbeat people have trouble maintaining. This becomes a struggle because, for some reason, the world continually highlights  unhappiness.</p><p> The odd thing is most people&mdash;individually&mdash;are good-minded. But, something seems to happen when people mass-up (or watch the evening news). It&rsquo;s a phenomenon I haven&rsquo;t decoded yet.</p><p> What I have been able to crack, however, is the formula for maintaining happiness that carries me  through any level of difficulty.</p><p> There isn&rsquo;t anything earth-shattering about these techniques. Like most things in your life, it&rsquo;s not awareness that&rsquo;s the problem. It&rsquo;s the execution.</p><p> To make it easy, 80% of this happiness how-to formula can be done on your own. You might need a few playmates for the other 20%. We simply can&rsquo;t escape the fact that next to food and shelter, people&rsquo;s greatest needs are love and appreciation. Remember that the next time a friend comes to you in need.</p><li> <strong>  Smile. </strong> It&rsquo;s easier than frowning. It takes less energy. And, it makes you feel good no matter what. Extend it to a laugh and it&rsquo;s impossible to be upset even if for a moment.</li><li> <strong>  Be Grateful. </strong> A grateful person never takes anything for granted. I promise that no matter how bad you think your life is, there are many things to be grateful for. If all else fails, think about people in the world who will never have what you have at this moment. There. All better.</li><li> <strong>  Exercise. </strong> It looks painful if you&rsquo;ve never tried it, but when it&rsquo;s over you&rsquo;ll feel better. It&rsquo;s just how our physiology works.</li><li> <strong>  Travel. </strong> Seeing new places is fantastic. It stimulates your brain, which normally likes to operate on a path of least resistance. (Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s biologically set up to do that so don&rsquo;t feel guilty.) When you plan and take a trip, you get a three-fer&mdash;the anticipation, the experience, and the memory. If you can&rsquo;t afford to hop on a plane, get in your car and drive to a new neighborhood. Look at the houses. Check out the trees. Don&rsquo;t run anyone over while you&rsquo;re gaping.</li><li> <strong>  Spend time with people you love. </strong> Just make sure you&rsquo;re smiling together and not moaning.</li><li> <strong>  Buy a dog. </strong> My dogs have taught me more than any human being not named Mom or Dad. Pay attention to the way they live. Eat. Sleep. Poop. Unconditional love. Anyone who scratches or pets them is their friend. Every meal is the best meal even though it&rsquo;s always the same meal. A walk is the daily highlight. They always focus on the present moment. I&rsquo;m convinced they were created to be human antidepressants.</li><li> <strong>  Eat somewhere new. </strong> Try new things. Even if the meal isn&rsquo;t the best meal. Take notice of the environment and presentation of the food. Take in the ambiance, smell, lighting, glassware, dishware, and so on. If you&rsquo;re a homebody, make something new for dinner once every week.</li><li> <strong>  Sleep. </strong> It&rsquo;s one of the most important things you can do for yourself. A tired mind is awful.</li><li> <strong>  Slow down your day. </strong> Here are  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/21-not-so-secret-ways-to-slow-down-your-day/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   21 Ways to Slow Down Your Day  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Accept. </strong> The sooner you accept what is, the happier you&rsquo;ll be. &ldquo;What is&rdquo; is what&rsquo;s supposed to be. Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t be.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  What are your techniques for being happy? </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Our education system is dormant and stagnant. It stirs up a lot of discussion, but what is actually changing in the nearby future? With that question in my head, I recently gave in to the urge to find out what is withholding us from creating an educational system that is based on lifelong learning. Why? Because in this volatile world that is disrupted in so many ways by innovation and technology, it seems impossible to ever stop learning when you want to keep up with society.</p><p> One of the interesting sources I stumbled upon was  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_how_to_escape_education_s_death_valley/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a video of Ken Robinson  </a> </u> , a great speaker and true inspirer when it comes to unlocking creativity. In this video of his Ted Talk he said:</p><p> You take an area, a school, a district, you change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility, a different set of expectations, a broader range of opportunities, you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners, you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do, and schools that were once bereft spring to life.&rdquo;</p><p> A powerful range of ideas. I think he is right, but changing those conditions is the biggest challenge we need to deal with in a cultural inheritance that brings along a traditional, rigid mind-set. Somehow most countries do not seem to be able to translate knowledge and business experiences into an educational system that properly connects with the daily practise. Although we have a pretty high-level education system in the Netherlands when it comes to knowledge, we are struggling with the same issue due to a system that is based on market and social circumstances in the past. Another issue is that people are educated for jobs that within ten years from now probably won&rsquo;t exist anymore, educating for jobs is for me something else than educating for continuous learning. Our education system is &ndash; as in most countries &ndash; not keeping pace with society. Furthermore, the focus seems to be out of balance. We have been inclined to the testing part and forget to take teaching and learning as the basic reference point. The diagnostic element can be important, but should never be leading.</p><h3> Technology: the example and the accelerator</h3><p> <br/> An example I read about I found quite similar looking at the route these companies had to take to be able to deal with the changing society. In  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.jungleminds.nl/blog/een-leven-lang-leren\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this Dutch article about lifelong learning  </a> </u>  education was compared to business software development. Companies as KLM, TNT and ING are nowadays investing in smaller software modules that are all connected and collaborate to the fullest extent; created through front-end development, also known as client side development. This modular way of developing makes them more flexible. It enables them to integrate with other platforms. In these cases you can think of ING customers being able to check their bank balance on their Apple watch or TNT customers that can use the track-and-trace functionality on their mobile devices. These companies need to change continuously and this is how they do that.</p><p> Another great example I know from my own environment is related to dynamic planning. The company  <u>  <a href=\"http://site.calendar42.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Calendar42  </a> </u>  bases its mission on the fact that most people follow their planning obsessively, almost as a planning fetish. This forms a huge distraction from what really matters. So what is their mission? Well, to restore to the World the freedom to focus on the here and now. They do this by enabling businesses to make their planning based on last-minute data (the influencing variables that define your efficiency) by connecting user-friendly applications with their C42 platform. So they help other companies to change. For instance, it enables insurers to optimise their claim management or employment agencies and hospitals to optimise their workforce management. This company makes use of a development method that foresees in the possibility to connect future functionalities; it learns from practise and adapts accordingly. Highly efficient and super agile in the rapidly changing society.</p><h3> What we can learn from these businesses</h3><p> <br/> These examples show two key strategies of which I think today&rsquo;s education system should embrace in the context of lifelong learning: a modular approach and a client-side focus . With these two strategies and the widespread possibilities of technology learning institutions can develop foundational education as a basis for future personal development, design courses that motivate self-education skills and create possibilities for exploration. In order to achieve this, educational institutions should not only collaborate with each other, but also work together with businesses, preferably linked to the industries that are in the surroundings of each school in question. This way we can create ecosystems that motivate and facilitates lifelong learning.</p><p> These innovative ecosystems should be accessible for everyone, regardless the reason that people have for their need to develop: <br/> <br/> &bull; Any person that didn&rsquo;t go to school at a young age, should at any time be able to catch up. <br/> &bull; Any person that wants to change careers, should always be able to follow courses that enable the switch. <br/> &bull; Any person that wants to stay up to date and keep pace with society, should always be able to refresh skills, knowledge and competences to improve their position in the labour market. <br/>  </p><p> People do not only learn for their careers, they often experience learning as a primary necessities to keep on working on their personal development. It gives them a sense of growth and usefulness in their lives. Society needs to use that sense and meet these necessities, so in the future individuals and society will flawlessly connect again. Continuously. Lets&rsquo; make it even more concrete, it is about learning how to learn and develop; obtaining and reproducing knowledge is becoming obsolete.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In 2009, Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma single-handedly created the Singles Day sale by converting a fabricated holiday celebrated among lonely college students into what has become the biggest revenue-generator the world has ever known. By copyrighting the phrase &ldquo;Double 11&rdquo;&mdash;a play on November 11&mdash;and aggressively courting merchants, Ma&rsquo;s gargantuan ecommerce company Alibaba manages to stay ahead of the competition and sell more merchandise in a 24-hour period than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.</p><p> Today, Alibaba controls around 80 percent of China&rsquo;s ecommerce market and is giving global retail giants like Amazon a run for their money. To keep up with the stiff competition, Walmart plans to spend $2 billion over the next two years to improve its own ecommerce infrastructure.</p><p> When explaining the significance of Alibaba and Singles Day, I&rsquo;m prone to pull out every synonym for &ldquo;big&rdquo; and &ldquo;huge&rdquo; I can think of. So instead, I&rsquo;ll let the numbers speak for themselves.

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deniseleeyohn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Denise Lee Yohn  </a> </u>  |  <u>  <a href=\"http://deniseleeyohn.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   deniseleeyohn.com  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  To excel in customer experience, you can't just rely on good design and solid execution. Your customer experience shouldn't just be great -- it should also be differentiated. </strong> <br/> <br/> Customer experience has evolved just as product and service did. Time was, all you needed was a good quality product. But then, as competition and customers' expectations increased, product manufacturers realized that quality was no longer a strong enough appeal. Products needed to be different in order to stand out among all the customers' choices, to give people specific reasons to choose them, and to prompt repeat purchases. <br/> <br/> The same thing has happened with customer service. Truly excellent service may still be hard to find, but generally speaking, friendly, knowledgeable employees have become table stakes for most companies. Retailers now look to tactics like equipping employees with digital devices and providing personal consultations as ways to differentiate their service. <br/> <br/> Differentiation is just as important in customer experience. Because customer experience is still an emerging discipline in some industries, you may think that simply undertaking a more rigorous approach to designing and managing your customer experiences may be enough. And to be sure, customer experience fundamentals -- being more attuned to customers' need along their entire journey, integrating different elements into a cohesive and seamless experience, and consistently executing with excellence -- are all important. <br/> <br/> But to establish your customer experience as a true competitive advantage, it must be distinctive -- it must be noticeable, valuable, and memorable to customers. Good, generic customer experiences will soon simply define the playing field. Differentiation will be how brands win. <br/> <br/> And your customer experience can't just be different for the different's sake. Your customer experience must be developed and delivered based on unique brand attributes and values. In fact, your customer experience is the most powerful way to make your brand uniqueness real and valuable. <br/> <br/> Consider how Westin Hotel &amp; Resorts has aligned its customer experience with its brand positioning rooted in wellness. Westin goes beyond providing a seamless reservation and check-in process, clean and comfortable rooms, and good amenities. <br/> <br/> The Westin wellness brand experience started back in 1999 when the company introduced the luxe Heavenly Bed to help guests sleep better. This extended into relaxation and stress-reducing offerings like the Heavenly Bath and Heavenly Bath. Now there's WestinWORKOUT fitness centers, RunWESTIN group runs and running maps, and a program in which guests can borrow fitness apparel and shoes during their stay. Room service and restaurant menu options feature juices, smoothies, and other healthful offerings. And just last year, Westin introduced a Sleep Sensor Wearable-Lending program, in which guests can use digital devices to improve their sleep through sleep pattern tracking and virtual coaching. <br/> <br/> PIRCH, the high-end appliance and plumbing retailer, provides another example of a brand-driven customer experience. PIRCH's unusual brand motto, \"Live Joyfully,\" is baked into every aspect of the store experience. A \"Barista of Joy\" greets customers at the entrance to the store and offers them a complimentary coffee or infused water. In the &ldquo;Sanctuary&rdquo; section of the store, customers will find working shower heads, saunas, and tubs, along with an invitation to  schedule a time to test the showers -- PIRCH will even provide bathrobes. Samples of food prepared using PIRCH products flow freely throughout the kitchen area and a \"Department of Yes\" sign designates the customer service area.  New employees are trained to empathize with customers and to tap their own personal experiences of joy to shape their customer interactions. All this adds up to customers feeling joyful because of the genuine, thoughtful experience PIRCH deliberately designs and manages around joy. <br/> <br/> These are just two examples of extraordinary experiences; many other companies are following suit.  Customer experience has become a critical business discipline. Now it's time for you to make it a powerful brand differentiator.</p>",

    "link": "micro-managers-the-good-the-bad-and-how-not-to-be-the-ugly",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In 1966, Clint Eastwood starred in a movie titled &ldquo;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.&rdquo; This spaghetti western told the story of three men searching for gold. The last scene is a famous three-way shootout, leaving the Good (Clint Eastwood) alive, the Bad dead and the Ugly barely surviving. In the world of business, we often encounter good, bad and ugly leaders. Many times these leaders are micro-managers. Is being a micro-manager a horrible attribute in a manager or not? Let&rsquo;s take a look at micro-managers and how this complex characteristic can be good, bad or ugly.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Is%20being%20a%20micro-manager%20always%20a%20horrible%20attribute%20of%20a%20leader%3F%20http%3A%2F%2Fblog.bridgebetween.com%2Fmicro-managers-the-good-the-bad-and-how-not-to-be-the-ugly%2F%20via%20%40shannoncassidy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Is being a micro-manager always a horrible attribute of a leader?  </a> </u></p><h3> The Good:</h3><p> <br/> Few corporate executives aspire to be micro-managers. The ideal leader is supposed to be a great delegator and motivator, not someone who tries to control every aspect of their employee&rsquo;s work.</p><p> However, a CEO who is a micro-manager has the ability to plow down obstacles and force uncooperative team members to take on challenges that drive the value of the product or service. Steve Jobs was famous for pushing his engineers past the bounds of what most considered reasonable&mdash;and getting great results from it. Walt Disney was a well-known micro-manager who obsessed over every detail of every ride design at his theme parks. This did not make him popular with his employees, but the end result was and is stellar.</p><p> To be an effective micro-manager, a leader must have a clear vision for success and how to achieve it. That leader must also be courageous and confident. If a plan fails, the buck stops at the micro-manager&rsquo;s desk. Sam Walton of Wal-Mart and William Rosenberg of Dunkin Donuts were well-known micro-managers who spent a large part of their time visiting stores to make sure their products were of the best quality. The &ldquo;Good&rdquo; micro-managers above were all visionaries for their companies. Their passion for their businesses drove their desire for accomplishment. With that same kind of intense commitment, a micro-manager can propel a company to success. &ldquo;Good&rdquo; micro-managers can be an asset.</p><h3> The Bad:</h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately, micro-managers are usually seen as &ldquo;Bad.&rdquo; While they can be assets, micro-managers obsessively control and bring tension and frustration to their companies. If you are a leader with this style, you might sometimes feel driven to push everyone around you to succeed, but often it&rsquo;s at the cost of your colleagues&rsquo; confidence.</p><p> You might be a &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; micro-manager if you:</p><li> Resist delegating</li><li> Correct tiny details instead of looking at the big picture</li><li> Discourage others from making decisions without consulting you</li><li> Ask for frequent updates on where things stand</li><li> Prefer to be cc&rsquo;d on emails</li><li> Are never satisfied with anyone&rsquo;s work <br/>  </li><p> If you find that micro-managing is part of your style of leadership but is negatively affecting your company and the people you lead, change is possible.</p><h3> How Not To Be the Ugly:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Commit to hiring the right people. </strong> Look for employees that are accountable for their work. Screen possible additions to your team to see if they proactively seek information and feedback. Hire team players that are clear on the company&rsquo;s goals and are able to articulate it back to you. If you create an extensive hiring process, you will be able to more easily trust your employees, and thus cutting the need to micro-manage.</p><p> <strong>  Clearly and frequently communicate expectations. </strong>  If your team doesn&rsquo;t know what you expect, they will not give it to you. Communication is important so that you do not have to control what others might or might not be doing. Set consistent times for this type of communication. For instance, on a certain project set a meeting once every month to make sure everyone is on the same page. Be careful not to treat your team like children who need to be told the rules again and again.</p><p> <strong>  Listen. </strong>  Great leaders are masters at listening to their team members. Micro-managers often fail to listen to their employees, arrogantly believing they know best in all circumstances. The people you work with have important insights and ideas. If you don&rsquo;t listen, they will feel disengaged and their work will suffer. If you choose to listen, you will create an atmosphere where your employees feel that they are valued contributors.</p><p> As a leader, you have the responsibility to root out the bad micro-managing, fix the ugly and encourage the good. Prevent a three-way shoot-out: address the micro-managing in yourself and others directly. By doing so, you will find the gold in your company.</p>",

    "content": "<p> America is a global economic superpower obsessed with competitiveness &mdash; but are we as productive as we could be? While American workers do put in long hours and have notoriously few vacation days, they only rank third on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Global Competitiveness Report of 2014-2015  </a> </u> , according to the World Economic Forum.

Start your mornings in the office by outlining your game plan and major goals for the day. Manage items with the greatest urgency first, and aim to check them off the list by the end of the first half of your workday; tend to less important tasks in the second half of the day when your energy and focus are not as strong.</li><li> <strong>  Minimize trivial distractions. </strong> Distractions keep you from accomplishing daily targets, because they divide your attention and weaken your concentration. When you have a critical assignment that you need to work on, you should distance yourself from your weakness (e.g., social media, electronics) and limit possible interruptions (wear headphones, close the door, put up a &lsquo;do not disturb&rsquo; sign) in order to avoid sabotaging your efforts.</li><li> <strong>  Get better at managing email. </strong> Email overload is one of the major time wasters at work. Create an email filing system that has folders for your correspondence groups &mdash; Client A, Client B, Vendors. Delete or archive everything that you will have no use for in the future, such as emails from former suppliers, job applicants, and notifications regarding meetings that have already been held. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to designate specific time slots for checking your inbox so that you don&rsquo;t get distracted by constantly going back and force between surveying your email account and doing your job. Lastly, don&rsquo;t put off until later email responses that take less than a minute to complete.</li><li> <strong>  Streamline routine tasks. </strong> Administrative, technical and other routine tasks are always going to be a part of your day, so it&rsquo;s important to be smart when it comes to finding time for them. Create templates for responses to typical client inquiries, donation requests and sales pitches, as well as drafts for letters of introduction, feedback reports or meeting agenda emails&ndash; this will help you save valuable time by eliminating some of the repetitive &ldquo;grind.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Do your own work first. </strong> Helping co-workers can be an important (and nice) thing to do, but not at the expense of your own priorities. As difficult as it may be, learning how and when to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a colleague&rsquo;s request or offer is a key success skill. <br/>  </li><p> This advice only works well when employees not only notice but also really strive to change those behaviors that are limiting them. In many instances, however, workers don&rsquo;t have the drive to modify their time-wasting habits or don&rsquo;t see any reason for working more diligently and that&rsquo;s when the management has to step in. What can managers do to minimize the harmful effects of these time-wasters? Part 2 will give you ideas for helping employees eradicate major time wasters, as well as coaching and motivating them to work more efficiently.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg were giving a joint interview and the subject of directing came up.  The interviewer asked what Tom Hanks does when he is criticized during the filming. His response was that the mutual respect between him and Steven encourages an open exchange of movie-making methods, which is a crucial part of their movie-making success.</p><p> What we can learn from this is two very important aspects of a successful business operation. First is that one should remember that critiques, the addition of new research material, and third party expectations should be viewed objectively, and not be taken personally, or seen as a comment on someone&rsquo;s politics. This requires a healthy sense of self-esteem and self-confidence: two critical components of an entrepreneur.</p><p> The second is that once you can distance yourself from the feedback, you can more easily remind yourself that the feedback and critique is actually helping your business become better. A critical component of listening is  <strong>  respect </strong> , even if you disagree with the communication. In business, we need to pay more attention to developing and practicing the notion of respect with all our partners like, for example, our clients, suppliers, and resources, so that the decision-making process can be improved.</p><p> This requires:</p><li> Understanding;</li><li> Politeness;</li><li> Courtesy;</li><li> Being knowledgeable; and</li><li> Encouraging communication. <br/>  </li><p> But let&rsquo;s take it a step further.</p><p> Respect within the organization itself motivates participants to have a more invested approach to their role.  It improves performance, morale, and, yes, even attendance.  The overall environment of the business will be all the better for it.</p><p> A good example is &ldquo;customer service.&rdquo;</p><p> The Four Seasons Hotel always impressed me with the company&rsquo;s focus on apologizing for a less than perfect experience, and in finding the perfect solution.  However, I&rsquo;ve found that in other organizations, placing blame is the game, and the problem goes unsolved and a really great opportunity was lost.  I wish I had a dollar for each time I&rsquo;ve heard, &ldquo;Those are the rules and I can&rsquo;t change them,&rdquo; even if a practical solution could be easily figured out.</p><p> Respect requires politeness, but should not be preoccupied with &ldquo;political correctness.&rdquo; A trait of many successful cultures is one where participants can vigorously debate and challenge assumptions and alternatives without regard to authority or power, or making a comment that may not coincide with beliefs of other staff or management.  A healthy business debate can be an invaluable problem-solving technique.</p><p> Here are some fairly simple strategies to encourage respect:</p><li> Include the phrases  &ldquo;please,&rdquo; &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo;  and  &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;  in your discussions.  Just hearing these phrases can ease the situation.</li><li> Understand and encourage diverse points of view. Invite experts in other areas, ensure everyone&rsquo;s voice is heard in staff meetings, and include  &ldquo;what if?&rdquo;  alternatives in discussions.  In my work, I role-play with clients to practice this all- important concept.</li><li> There is no substitution for experience, knowledge, and experience.   A gifted staff, who know they have respect from every level in the organization, will develop the best solutions.  They will be your best problem-solvers! <br/>  </li><p> In summary, respect for customers, suppliers, and participants is critical and frequently overlooked.  But, it&rsquo;s an inexpensive component of success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Working in modestly-sized space, in a texting-driven age, many of us experience a daily slew of e-mails consisting of &ldquo;thx,&rdquo; &ldquo;see me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;let&rsquo;s discuss,&rdquo; often from a colleague five feet away. Needless to say, such communications seem efficient but, when aggregated over time, create an &ldquo;Ethernet&rdquo; wall that makes office life less personal, less human, less engaging and eventually less fulfilling. <br/> <br/> The importance of face-to-face communication is exceptionally relevant when it comes time to collaborate, even if the face-to-face is facilitated by technology. &ldquo;Email brainstorms&rdquo; and &ldquo;group think&rdquo; sessions are definitely timesaving, but relying solely on this type of impersonal dialogue is not the best way for all the best ideas to be heard; the passion behind them cannot be effectively conveyed through email chains. <br/> <br/> Especially in this technological age, there is no excuse for not having everyone around a table together &ndash; even Skype-ing colleagues in Tokyo allows offices to chat face-to-face in real-time with colleagues in Chicago. <br/> <br/> When personal touch is lost, time is not lost, but meaningful relationship building is. Technology has &ldquo;lazyfied&rdquo; the communications process and the outcome diminishes the effectiveness and efficiency of getting messages sent and received.  Harnessing the power of face-to-face communication is key to harnessing the power of your workforce&hellip;keeping them happy, and working for you longer. <br/> <br/> We&rsquo;re all operating at warp speed with jam-packed schedules, but taking the time to talk to one another provides an opportunity to build and strengthen relationships as well as improve work outcomes. Feelings and emotions cannot be conveyed easily in an abbreviated 140-character tweet or an email furiously typed out on an iPhone in the back of a cab. <br/> <br/> It might take less time to bullet-out the directions for a new project in an email to a coworker or text about how excited you are to start it, but the elation simply cannot be conveyed adequately. Walking down the hall to tell your employee how to do a project and how much you are looking forward to it is more meaningful to him or her, and will lead to a better product and employees who feel more valued and listened to. <br/> <br/> Taking the time and energy to communicate face-to-face is crucial in creating an office culture in which employees feel appreciated, respected and heard.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Your business can't afford to fall behind in social media developments. What worked this year might not work next year, as platforms develop and new entrants to the market attract new users. This means an integral part of my role as a social media consultant is to keep a close eye on the future trends. So, what's next in social media?</p><p> As a recent article on Entrepreneur underlined, social media changes at breakneck speed. It's easy to forget that less than a decade ago, Myspace and Friends Reunited were the main players on the scene. As social media has matured and developed, there are more opportunities than ever for businesses to communicate with a mass audience.</p><h3> 1. Facebook to grow fastest among older people</h3><p> <br/> Facebook will remain the leading social networking site in 2016 according to eMarketer research, but the fastest growing demographic will be people over 65. Who would have predicted that five years ago? In contrast, 18-24 year olds are defecting from Facebook as one of their primary networks as they migrate to Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. These two trends may not, of course, be entirely unrelated!</p><p> What could this mean for businesses? What is in no doubt is that there are increasing opportunities to use social media to reach older people, both as consumers and as business owners.</p><h3> 2. Messaging apps will continue to grow in significance</h3><p> <br/> This year, the top four messaging apps gained the same number of users as the top four social networking platforms. Apps like Snapchat and WhatsApp not only offer access to low-cost texts, voice calls and video calls; increasingly, users are engaging with their favourite brands too.</p><p> New services like Snapchat's Discover function will allow users to follow updates from brands and celebrities, receive special offers and even make bookings. Could your business use the same technology to build a loyal following?</p><h3> 3. Social networks will be used even more as search engines</h3><p> <br/> Although search engines remain a vital route for people to access your business, social media has a growing role. For example, 80% of consumers online say they are influenced by reviews and online comments by other consumers.</p><p> Sites like YouTube, Facebook and Yelp are important influencers on consumer decisions. Pinterest is a key site for women in their 30s, a demographic with strong buying power. No surprise then that there has been a substantial increase in brands driving Pinterest traffic seamlessly from product-related posts to company websites.</p><h3> 4. Big data and personalisation</h3><p> <br/> Internet companies are rapidly accruing data about consumers' tastes and preferences, and they are getting much more sophisticated in using this data to personalise services, form relationships and create novel experiences.</p><p> Companies do best when they use actionable data insights to deliver experiences for consumers, inviting them to become part of a culture rather than make a transaction.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://torchlite.com/author/susan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Susan Marshall  </a> </u></p><p> It is important for businesses to realize that integrated digital marketing is not just a fad, but rather,  <u>  an evolution in marketing </u> . Sure, one-off ad campaigns still exist, but they are no longer the cornerstone of ROI that they once were, back in the days of Don Draper when newspaper and radio slots were all the rage. To succeed in today&rsquo;s techonomy, businesses need to adopt sophisticated marketing strategies (via @SynecoreTech). But where does your company even start? Digital marketing can be overwhelming, and it&rsquo;s changing every single day. But it&rsquo;s also important to realize that if you don&rsquo;t change, you&rsquo;ll be left in the dust and your competitors will have the upper hand. In this post, we start to explore some of the benefits of digital marketing</p><h3> The Benefits of Digital Marketing</h3><p> What will digital marketing actually do for your business?  <u>  <a href=\"http://cjgdigitalmarketing.com/top-10-benefits-of-digital-marketing-for-small-business-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CJG Digital Marketing  </a> </u>  put together these 10 Benefits of Digital Marketing for companies that are just getting started in the digital world:</p><p> 1. Digital Marketing Connects You with Consumers on the Internet</p><p> 2. Digital Marketing Generates Higher Conversion Rates</p><p> 3. Digital Marketing Saves You Money</p><p> 4. Digital Marketing Enables Real-Time Customer Service</p><p> 5. Digital Marketing Connects You with the Mobile Consumer</p><p> 6. Digital Marketing Helps Generate Higher Revenues</p><p> 7. Digital Marketing Delivers Higher ROI from Your Campaigns</p><p> 8. Digital Marketing Keeps You at Par with Competitors</p><p> 9. Digital Marketing Can Help You Compete with Large Corporations</p><p> 10. Digital Marketing Prepares You for the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.marketingtechblog.com/the-internet-of-things/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Internet of Things  </a> </u></p><p> As much as 72% of consumers are already connecting with brands through their various digital marketing channels and activities according to reports from Mashable. Most businesses are adapting digital marketing strategies &ndash; and those that don&rsquo;t will likely be forced to in the short term or will be forced out of the space by their competitors.</p><h3> Digital Marketing Budgets are Increasing:</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s no secret that companies are spending more and more on digital marketing activities every year. But why? These digital channels prove to be an important way to connect with consumers, and consumers are demanding that companies meet them where they are: email, web, and social for starters. </p><p> Marketers are investing in the customer experience to drive business advantage and profitable revenue growth, according to a survey of marketing executives by  <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2895817\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Gartner </a> , Inc. The survey found that marketing budgets remained healthy in 2014, with, on average, companies spending 10.2 percent of their annual 2014 revenue on overall marketing activities, with 50 percent of companies planning an increase in 2015. Digital marketing spending averaged one-quarter of the marketing budget in 2014. The survey found that of the 51 percent of companies who plan to increase their digital marketing budget in 2015, the average increase will be 17 percent. (via @Gartner_Inc)</p><h3> Just Getting Started?</h3><p> <br/> When something works well in the world of big business, it&rsquo;s usually just a matter of time before smaller companies start adopting the same strategy or some scaled-down version of it. With digital marketing, that process is already well underway. </p><p> In a recent  <u>  survey </u>  by Inc. Magazine, the publication asked participants &ldquo;Which of the following tools/solutions does your firm currently use in its digital marketing strategy? Which are found to be the most effective?&rdquo; (via @Inc)</p><h3> Start Somehwere:</h3><p> <br/> Just like anything else in life, digital marketing won&rsquo;t be perfect the first time. It will take some time to learn what works for your business, how much budget you should carve out each year, and how to measure its success. But the key is to start somewhere &ndash; start small and grow bigger or time. Capture the success stories and learn from what doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "10-signs-your-client-is-at-risk-of-leaving-and-3-ways-to-prevent-it",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Anyone who has ever been in business has had the gut-wrenching experience of losing a client.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes we see it coming: the client has expressed some level of dissatisfaction or we simply &ldquo;felt&rdquo; it was a poor fit. While devastating, at least we&rsquo;ve had some warning signs, and we can resolve to do better next time. But the losses that hurt the most are the ones that seem to come out of nowhere.</p><p> <strong>  Based on the financial advisors we&rsquo;ve talked to, it seems that, more often than not, it is their female clients, or the widows in couples they serve, who left them high and dry. </strong> These were clients they assumed were perfectly content.</p><h3> So why do female clients just walk away rather than tell you they&rsquo;re unhappy?</h3><p> <br/> I put this question to a group of female friends over lunch recently. A lively conversation ensued, they all offered examples of doing just that, from putting up with poor haircuts for years before quietly leaving a hairdresser to being reluctant to fire a ho-hum accountant. The consensus was they didn&rsquo;t want to be unkind, rude or appear to be judgmental. They opined that they had probably been conditioned in many subtle ways, &ldquo;to not hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo; Nice girls simply did not complain. They readily admitted to being far more inclined to leave a bad situation, than &ldquo;confront&rdquo; the issue.</p><p> Whatever the reason, this presents a significant challenge for financial advisors. How do you know your client is at risk of leaving and, more importantly, how can you prevent it? First and foremost, do not assume that the client is happy and pay close attention to the strength of the relationship. In fact, women we interviewed frequently used the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; to describe their relationship with their financial advisor. But those who didn&rsquo;t, talked about their relationship in very different terms.</p><h3> <strong>  Ten tell-tale signs that a client may not be happy: </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. They are not engaged in the conversation when you meet. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. They don&rsquo;t ask questions or add their perspective when you call. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. They don&rsquo;t thank you for the work you&rsquo;re doing on their behalf. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. They don&rsquo;t offer referrals or introductions. </strong></p><p> <strong>  5. They haven&rsquo;t added to their portfolio in more than a year.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  6. When you speak with the client, you do most of the talking (not the client). </strong></p><p> <strong>  7. Usually, you wait for the client to reach out to you rather than you reaching out to them. And, more often than not, they call your assistant. </strong></p><p> <strong>  8. You catch yourself getting defensive with them. </strong></p><p> <strong>  9. You dread calling them because it always feels like a lot of work. </strong></p><p> <strong>  10. You haven&rsquo;t talked with them in the last six months. </strong></p><p> Spend some time reviewing your client base. If more than 4-5 of the above apply to any one client, you may be at risk of losing them. Of course knowing who may be leaving is just a start &ndash; knowing how to prevent it is the key to success.</p><h3> Three action steps to prevent a client from leaving <br/> <br/> <strong>  Leave your ego at the door and confront the issue! </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. While women may not be confrontational, they certainly like to share their opinions. </strong> And, if they are encouraged to express their views, they will.</p><p> <strong>  2. Schedule a meeting and ask them straight out whether there is a problem and / or how could you make it more interesting for them to engage in the conversation. </strong> Ask questions like:</p><li> <p>  I&rsquo;ve noticed you&rsquo;re not as engaged as you used to be. Is there something wrong? </p></li><li> <p>  What is going on in your life that may be causing you extra stress? </p></li><li> <p>  What could I be doing differently to make our meetings more meaningful for you? </p></li><p> <strong>  3. But here&rsquo;s the thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s not enough to simply ask the questions, you have to be genuine in caring about her as a person (not just keeping her account). </strong> You have to listen, really listen and act on what she is telling you. Anything less and you&rsquo;d be shooting yourself in the foot. Women have an uncanny ability to know when you are feigning interest in her. </p><p> The art of mindful listening and being genuine is a whole other topic &ndash; tune in to our next blog.</p><h3> <strong>  Take Away </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  You may be able to spend less time chasing new clients if you take care of existing female clients. </strong> Women have more investable assets than ever before and happy female clients will refer you to their friends. </p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

    "content": "<h3> What&rsquo;s holding you back from diving into social selling to rock your sales? Do you think it&rsquo;s too costly?</h3><p> <br/> Right now, 79 percent of sales people who use social media outsell their peers according to Forbes. Emailing marketing alone has two-times higher ROI than cold calling, networking or even trade shows. Plus, cold calling is 60 percent more expensive per lead than any other method.</p><p> Do you worry that putting social selling in place will take too much time? Think again. The traditional- sales process takes 22 percent longer than five years ago. Social selling cuts that time down and can provide an avenue to scale your sales efforts more effectively.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s face it. Cold calling doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s time to be part of that 79 percent crew.</h3><p> <br/> You can create more business opportunities by investing just 15 to 30 minutes a day in your <u>  social selling </u> . Yes, you read that right: 30 minutes a day is all you&rsquo;ll need, if you work smart and make it part of your daily routine.</p><p> You probably already make a daily commitment to making appointments, why not schedule your social selling time? It is easy and simple to make social selling part of your daily sales and marketing efforts without taking up too much time. Use the following outline for an effective and easy approach in 30 minutes or less a day:</p><li> <strong>  Review your upcoming meetings to make sure you&rsquo;re connected with your clients or prospects on LinkedIn. </strong> Beyond these contacts, consider connecting with other company decision makers and appropriate department managers.</li><li> <strong>  Do a little research (or  <u>   <a href=\"https://shoefitts.com/cybersleuthing-for-sales-success/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    cyber sleuthing   </a>  </u>  as I like to call it) on those connections. </strong> Read their summary statements, work histories and interests. Also, check out the people and companies they follow, and look at their connections for people you might know.</li><li> <strong>  Look at the month&rsquo;s events and meetings you&rsquo;ll be attending. </strong> Research possible connections, and look for ways to start interacting now to help elevate your presence and start conversations. Many event organizers create Twitter hashtags or LinkedIn Groups to get people talking in advance. (They realize the power of social media as well!)</li><li> <strong>  Follow your clients&rsquo; and prospects&rsquo; companies on LinkedIn </strong> and set up <u>  <a href=\"https://newsle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Newsle  </a> </u> notifications so you receive a daily email notification when your connections are mentioned. Use this knowledge to acknowledge good press, promotions, etc.</li><li> <strong>  Look for thought leaders in your industry, region and local community. </strong> These influential people can help you make and build connections.</li><li> <strong>  See who is commenting and sharing your updates and posts. </strong> Consider connecting with them. Even better, did you know you can search posts for specific terms? This provides a proactive way for you to contribute to relevant discussions.</li><li> <strong>  Use Advanced People Search to find possible connections using the various filters available to narrow your efforts. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> This may sound like a lot of work, but honestly it will only take you 30 minutes or less.</h3><p> <br/> If it helps, break the time down into two 15-minutes sessions &mdash; one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Believe me, you&rsquo;ll start to see the benefits in no time.</p>",

A Personal and Health Care Representation Agreement (RA) allows another person to make decisions for us when we are not able to do so due to illness or injury.</p><p> In British Columbia, anyone over the age of 19 can sign a Personal and Health Care RA. Under an RA, you can give your representative authority to make any decision they consider necessary for your personal care. You can also specify what types of decisions that person can make for you. Some examples of decisions which you may want to have a representative make for you include ones about your:</p><li> Diet</li><li> Dress</li><li> Living arrangements</li><li> Participation in educational activities</li><li> Access to personal information <br/>  </li><h3> Major Health Care Decisions Included in a Personal and Health Care RA</h3><p> <br/> Under British Columbia&rsquo;s Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act, you can designate another person to make major health care decisions for you, including ones involving the following:</p><li> Major surgery and any procedure where a general anesthetic will be used</li><li> Major diagnostic or investigative procedures</li><li> Laser surgery</li><li> Kidney dialysis</li><li> Radiation therapy</li><li> Intravenous chemotherapy</li><li> Electroconvulsive therapy <br/>  </li><h3> Minor Health Decisions Under a Personal/Health Care RA</h3><p> <br/> You can also have your representative make decisions about minor health decisions as well, such as:</p><li> Routine medical tests</li><li> Routine dental treatments which do not require a general anesthetic <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  General Provisions </strong></p><p> You can choose to give your representative the authority to consent to or refuse health care treatments without including any specific instructions in the document. If you make that choice, your representative can give or refuse consent for life-saving measures.</p><h3> Before You Sign a Personal and Health Care Representation Agreement</h3><p> <br/> Signing a Representation Agreement is an important document, but you will want to spend some time thinking about your wishes before you sign one.</p><li> What kinds of decisions would you make about your health care if you were unable to make decisions for yourself, but otherwise healthy?</li><li> Would you want doctors to use extraordinary measures to preserve your life if you were severely injured and not expected to survive?</li><li> Would you be prepared to consent to a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order or do you want doctors to attempt to start your heart if it stops beating?</li><li> Do you want to be placed on a respirator if you are unable to continue breathing on your own? <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s a good idea to write your wishes down and discuss them with the person who will be your representative. Having to make health and personal care decisions for someone who is unable to do so is a very stressful situation, and the person you choose would no doubt appreciate some guidance so that he or she can follow your wishes.</p><p> <strong>  What happens if I do not have a Representation Agreement? </strong></p><p> If you do not have a Representation Agreement and you are not capable to make health care decisions for yourself, a health care provider can appoint a person to make those decisions for you but only for a temporary period. The scope of the decision-making powers is also very limited. The person chosen is from an imposed list starting with a spouse/common law spouse, then adult children, then siblings, and so on.</p><p> <strong>  What is an Advance Directive? </strong></p><p> An Advance Directive allows you to express in writing today your future healthcare wishes if you are not able to communicate them at a later date due to incapacity. A healthcare practitioner must follow your requests. If a circumstance comes up that you did not address in your Advance Directive, then a healthcare provider must appoint a Temporary Substitute Decision Maker.</p><p> <strong>  Can I use my Power of Attorney to Delegate Personal and Health Care Decisions? </strong></p><p> No. A Power of Attorney can only be used to delegate your financial and legal affairs. With a Representation Agreement, you can delegate routine financial affairs and legal matters in addition to your personal and health care issues. However, real estate is not covered in a Representation Agreement and so an Enduring Power of Attorney should be sought.</p><h3> Proper Planning is Essential</h3><p> <br/> Proper personal planning gives us peace of mind as it can help to ensure we have quality of life and that our wishes are carried through should we become incapacitated. It allows us to remain in control of our life by making legal arrangements today delegating important decision-making to those we trust and whom have our best interest at heart. It also helps to make things easier on our loved ones.</p><p> A Representation Agreement is an important legal planning document and so it is best to seek legal advice to ensure that it is right for you. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> I watched as my nephew tried to stand on his feet at nine months old. He fell down and returned to crawling before trying to stand again. A few minutes later, he ignored his fears as he pulled himself back onto his feet, wobbled with his first step, and then fell again. <br/>  </h3><p> What if infants feared failure? Most of us would probably still be crawling around on all fours. Our fear of failure is irrational; it is supported by an illusion that failure means we are worthless.</p><p> The reality is that we cannot fail; we can only produce results. Psychologists recommend we respond to these results with questions such as &ldquo;What have I learned?&rdquo; What did I discover that I didn&rsquo;t start out to discover?&rdquo; &ldquo;What worked, or what didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; Mistakes are portals for discovery. When you try something and  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   produce a result that you did not intend, but find interesting, pursue it  </u>  . </a></p><p> It is a paradox of life that we have to learn to fail in order to succeed.</p><p> People can fail and still be successful because they don&rsquo;t give up. Here are 5 traits that distinguish successful people from average performers:</p><h3> 1. Keep At It <br/>  </h3><li> When average performers fail at something, they try something new.</li><li> When successful people fail at something, they attack the same problem again and again until they succeed. <br/>  </li><p> Rather than run from the failure that is keeping you from success, learn from it and embrace it. Others encounter an adversity, and then give up, moving to other projects until they find something at which they finally succeed. People with  <u>  mental toughness </u>  keep at it until they find the answer to the problem.</p><h3> 2. Bounce Back</h3><p> <br/> Great leaders, whatever organization or walk of life they are from, always go back to the same failure to explain their success. The failure, without exception, was traumatic and personally very difficult. It made them feel as though they&rsquo;d hit rock bottom and filled with desperation. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Bennis\" target=\"_blank\">   Warren Bennis  </a> </u>  said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if that moment the iron entered their soul; that moment created the resilience that leaders need.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. Choose Your Attitude</h3><p> <br/> The odds are good that if you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn&rsquo;t lead anywhere. Since adversity in life is a given, our success and happiness depend upon our ability to grow because of it. One of the most important decisions you make every day is the attitude with which you greet the world and the obstacles that come with it. Every day, you choose your own happiness.</p><h3> 4. Flexible Mindset</h3><p> <br/> People have one of two belief systems about how the mind works. We have either a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-New-Psychology-Success/dp/0345472322\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fixed mindset or a growth mindset  </a> </u> . People with a fixed mindset believe that each time they attempt something it&rsquo;s a reflection of their intelligence. A fixed mindset sees things in a winner/loser frame and therefore tends to see little that can be done to change the outcome.</p><p> But people who are taught that the brain is elastic and that they can become smarter and more competent&mdash;that the brain grows, like a muscle, when you work it hard&mdash;are less afraid to fail, they succeed more.</p><h3> 5. Be Patient</h3><p> <br/> Success is a slow-cooker, not a microwave. Often showing patience is boring&mdash;most of us are stimulated by drama, immediate gratification, and creativity.  <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Four-Ways-to-Be-Patient\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   But patience is a skill, not an inherited trait  </u>  . </a>  Catch your mind from ranting that you shouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation&mdash;you may have lost the battle, but not the war. Keep your eyes on the process, the results will take care of themselves.</p><p> The number one skill in life is having the mental toughness to not give up. Failure is life&rsquo;s great teacher so don&rsquo;t give up. While it may take a little effort to find it, as Viktor Frankl wisely reminds us, it is always possible to wrench something good out of misfortune.</p><p> &ldquo;Failure is where success likes to hide&mdash;in plain sight.&rdquo; ~ Scott Adams</p><p> What failures in your life have moved you in a better direction? What failures turned out &lsquo;not&rsquo; to be failures after all?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> If you had to guess which of your female clients will leave you over the next 5 years? 10 years?</h3><p> <br/> Many of your female clients have been with you for 10-20 years they would never leave you, or would they? Most financial advisors continue to stay in denial about their female clients. They assume their female clients are happy and committed to the relationship. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they think that, after years of service and good investment performance, why would they leave now?</p><p> Perhaps they are stuck in a rut. The routine of your relationship was created many years ago when women were less involved and rarely encouraged to participate in their financial affairs. Oh sure they continue to meet with you and go through the motions but are they really getting what they want from you? Times are changing and so must you if you plan to retain your female clients, today&rsquo;s woman wants more than just investment advice.</p><p> 90% of women know they need to become more involved in their financial affairs and 62% expressed a strong interest in learning more (Alliance women, power and money 2013).</p><p> Are they learning from you? If not don&rsquo;t be surprised if they turn to another financial advisor to get the education they want (and you know what happens next). The challenge with women is they won&rsquo;t always tell you they are not happy or that they want something more. Next thing you know you&rsquo;re getting an email to say her accounts are being transferred out.</p><h3> So if women won&rsquo;t tell you how do you know they are not happy?</h3><p> <br/> A good question and sometimes hard to answer but by answering the following questions you may get a better idea if you are adapting the new environment and encouraging the women&rsquo;s desire for more financial understanding:</p><li> <strong>  Is your female client smarter about her finances today as a result of working with you? </strong>  If so how?</li><li> <strong>  Does she reach out to you with financial questions </strong> that go beyond just investing in stocks and bonds or does she see you as simply a &ldquo;stock broker&rdquo;?</li><li> <strong>  Is she fully engaged in conversations during your face to face reviews </strong>  or is she just listening with little interest and agreeing with what you have to say?</li><li> <strong>  Could your female client explain her statement to you? </strong>  Does she truly understand what she is reading?</li><li> <strong>  Can your female client tell you the purpose for each of her investments </strong>  ie; growth, preservation, income? <br/>  </li><p> While women want to learn more they may not always speak up and ask, you may have to be the initiator and change things up a bit. As a financial advisor you must reach out and encourage your female clients to become more engaged. This is the right thing to do for every women and the best thing for your continued business success.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Very possibly, yes.  While there is little direct study on gender differences among business partners, some of the research on workplace teams may have interesting implications when it comes to how gender plays out in business partnerships.</h3><p> <br/> In a joint study from MIT, Carnegie Mellon and Union College published earlier this year, researchers found that the single most important element of an effective work group, was its \"average social sensitivity.\"  Basically, they found that the most effective groups were not those with the highest single IQ or average IQ overall, but those that were the best at reading subtle cues from their teammates.  Teams with more women were found to be more effective overall, with women also tending to score higher on assessments geared to emotional understanding. The test these researchers used, Reading the Mind in the Eyes, indicates sensitivity to non-verbal cues (a version of this test can be found <u>  <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/well-quiz-the-mind-behind-the-eyes/\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> ).</p><p> According to the researchers, individuals in the most effective teams were essentially &ldquo;more tuned in to one another, to subtle shifts in mood and demeanor&rdquo; which seems to help teams move forward and get less &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in their problem-solving.  Getting stuck in problem-solving is an often-cited issue for business partnerships that find themselves in trouble, so these findings may be especially helpful in thinking about the desired characteristics in a partner.</p><h3> The factors that make women critical team members may also apply to their success as co-founders in start-ups, although venture capital firms have been slow to recognize this. </h3><p> <br/> According to a 2014 study at the Diana Project at Babson College, about 15% of venture funding was given to founding teams with a woman, up from 5% in 1999, but still remarkably low. Businesses having all-male teams are more than four times as likely as founding teams with even one woman to receive funding. However, data also indicates that though women founders receive less funding overall, their first year revenues are 12% higher than all-male founder firms.</p><h3> Forming a business partnership may also solve a common obstacle for women considering launching a business: lower confidence than men.  </h3><p> <br/> A 2014 survey of entrepreneurs by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor noted that women are generally risk-averse and launching a business as seen as a high-risk option. According to the report, roughly 34% of U.S. women who saw opportunities to start a new business said that fear of failure would keep them from doing so, compared with 25.6% of men. This may result in fewer businesses launched by women. Having partner, and sharing that perceived risk, may give women the additional confidence needed to get started, and once they do, indications are that they may have a higher chance of success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Tired of the constant chatter about where interest rates are headed and what will happen when they finally rise? </strong> We&rsquo;ve compiled the following five ideas for positioning your clients&rsquo; bond portfolios to capture opportunities and navigate risks in fixed income &mdash; regardless of where rates go.</p><h3> 1. Own Individual Bonds</h3><p> <br/> An individual bond portfolio held in a separate account allows investors more control over the portfolio than a fund. The owner is not affected by other investors&rsquo; selling or buying activity which is the case in mutual funds. A panicked sell-off in the fixed income markets or a rise in rates would result in a decline in bond prices. It would lower the account value for the individual bond holder. However, if held to maturity, the individual bonds would regain all of their &ldquo;paper losses&rdquo; at maturity.  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=97\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   More on the differences between owning bond funds and individual bonds here  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 2. Take an Active Approach</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s important to remember that any investment entails taking risk, and that bonds can, in fact, lose money. The goal of any investment strategy should be to manage risk and reward. While we may be moving into a period when fixed income returns are diminished, bonds will continue to be used as a portfolio diversification tool and income generation tool. We believe the best way to address the future with fixed income is to take an active approach and utilize a broad set of tools to manage changing interest rates and volatility in bonds. Yield curves flatten, rise, fall and twist, and all of these scenarios create opportunities to deliver value above and beyond just the coupon. There are several ways to deliver greater return to the client by being active along the yield curve and maturity spectrum. By being passive, you forego that opportunity.</p><h3> 3. Maintain Flexibility</h3><p> <br/> Using actively managed, nontraditional bond strategies may help provide better risk-adjusted returns in a rising rate environment. Since the nontraditional bond category is a relatively new Morningstar category, it&rsquo;s important to do your research before selecting a strategy. Nontraditional bond approaches should have well defined objectives and levels of risk that the portfolio manager will take. Being flexible within one&rsquo;s fixed income allocation is important. For instance, a tactical fixed income manager will compare the benefits of taking duration versus credit risk. It&rsquo;s important for that manager to understand where we are in the business cycle. In our view in good phases of the cycle, it pays to be aggressive. In bad, it pays to be defensive. We believe a flexible approach can add a lot of value in the fixed income space.</p><h3> 4. Manage Duration Risk</h3><p> <br/> Duration measures a bond portfolio&rsquo;s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In any market environment, duration analysis helps the portfolio manager understand the effects of various portfolio changes such as a rise in interest rates. Duration analysis may help the manager to minimize volatility while maximizing total return. In a rising interest rate environment, excess duration risk has been seen to wreak havoc on a portfolio. We took a look at understanding duration in an earlier Navigator Insights.  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.ccmg.com/?p=612\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Here is a straightforward guide to understanding duration  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 5. Consider High Yield Bonds</h3><p> <br/> When interest rates rise, Treasury bonds typically decline in value. But because high yield bonds historically have been shown to be negatively correlated to Treasuries and have a high correlation to the equity markets, they may provide better returns in a rising rate environment. We believe high yield bonds may offer a better risk/return profile than Treasuries in a rising rate environment. However, because of their high correlation to equities, it&rsquo;s important to use an active approach when allocating to high yields. High yields carry more downside risk, and an active strategy can help provide risk management.</p>",

    "content": "<p> South Dakota is tops in many things. We are consistently rated as among the best in the nation for business climate, trust law, clean air, low taxes, and the best cities to retire in. <strong>  It annoys me, then, when we are last in something important, like teacher&rsquo;s salaries. </strong></p><p> But how do our lower cost of living and low state and local taxes affect our low salary ranking? Certainly salaries must buy more in the way of lifestyle in South Dakota than in states that have higher salaries but also higher taxes and living costs. I was willing to bet, when the annual salary of a South Dakota teacher was adjusted for cost of living and taxes, that we really wouldn&rsquo;t have the lowest salaries in the nation.</p><p> To find out, I first consulted data from the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/NEA_Rankings_And_Estimates-2015-03-11a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   National Education Association  </a> </u> to get the most current average state salaries of teachers. South Dakota was dead last with a $40,641 average. It was no surprise that the highest salaries in the nation are paid by coastal states of New York with $76,865, Massachusetts with $71,620, Washington DC with $70,906, California with $70,887, and New Jersey with $70,367.</p><p> I adjusted all the average teacher salaries for state and local taxes using data from the <u>  <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/annual-state-local-tax-burden-ranking-fy-2011\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tax Foundation  </a> </u> and for the cost of living using data from the <u>  <a href=\"https://www.c2er.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Council for Community and Economic Research  </a> </u> as presented by the <u>  <a href=\"https://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Missouri Economic Research and Information Center  </a> </u> . As I suspected, the amount of the salary isn&rsquo;t as important as the amount people have left after paying all their taxes and living expenses.</p><p> While teachers in New York are the highest paid in the nation, when you factor in what they pay for living expenses and taxes, they fall to 22nd place with an adjusted salary of $50,022. The adjusted salaries drop the second-highest paid teachers of Massachusetts to 37th place with $45,939, while those in the District of Columbia fall from third to 42nd with a comparatively low $43,379.</p><p> <strong>  Which teachers in the nation really make the most money? </strong> If you want the best lifestyle as a teacher, apply for positions in top-ranked Michigan where the adjusted salary is $61,020. The second-highest adjusted salaries are in Wyoming with $59,679, followed by Pennsylvania with $56,528, Ohio with $56,480, and Delaware with $55,211.</p><p> W <strong>  hat state had the honor of coming in dead last? </strong> Hawaii. It ranks 20th for its average teacher salary of $55,757, which becomes a stunningly paltry $30,200 after adjustments. To my surprise, South Dakota's adjusted average of $38, 644 only moved it from last place to second from last. Rounding out the bottom five are Maine with $39,216, New Mexico with $40,686, and West Virginia with $41,324.  </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Teacher-Salary-Chart.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Adjusting the average teacher salaries for various states' cost of living and tax rates  </a> </u> , however, does make a significant difference. For example, comparing only salaries shows the average South Dakota teacher makes $30,265 less than the average teacher in Washington DC. After adjusting for purchasing power, the South Dakota teacher earns just $4,735 less. While South Dakota teachers make $15,116 a year less than those in Hawaii, after adjusting for purchasing power South Dakota teachers make $8,444 more.</p><p> While the results could be slightly skewed by comparing 2011 tax numbers (the latest I found) with 2015 salaries and living costs, my research it suggests two conclusions. One, while South Dakota certainly is in the bottom tier of teacher&rsquo;s salaries, in terms of buying power we are nowhere close to being as far behind as it appears. <strong>  Second, if you are a teacher in Washington DC, you might consider heading west to Michigan or Wyoming. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> During a panel discussion this week with a collection of professionals from various parts of industry, one of the speakers was the CEO of one of the largest national real estate firms, and she dropped a bombshell in terms of how much their business has changed in just the last few years, and they are settling 14,000 deals a year.</p><p> Here it is:</p><h3> Over 95% of all new customer enquiries now begin online.</h3><h3> <br/> 100% of the deals are done in person.</h3><p> <br/> The traditional method of consumers seeing a local agent and essentially asking them to canvas the market and shortlist possibilities is almost gone.</p><p> The consumers are shopping the market themselves, and during that shopping process they are formulating their own shortlist of both properties and potential professionals to use.</p><p> <strong>  This is exactly what I, and many others like myself, have been telling financial services professionals for several years: </strong> the way consumers are buying has already changed.  Like the real estate industry, the actual implementation of advice &ndash; or selection and settlement of the particular product &ndash; remains difficult for many consumers, and they continue to use the professional to facilitate that.</p><h3> 100% of the deals are completed in person.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  That won&rsquo;t hold true for financial services though, as some of &ldquo;the deals&rdquo; for consumers in our space are reasonably simple and straightforward. </strong>  For instance, somebody buying a funeral insurance policy where there is no underwriting, a static sum insured and a minimal premium really doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to get a professional opinion most of the time.  Nor do the majority of people enrolling in KiwiSaver or employer superannuation. These are easy decisions for many consumers.  Perhaps for us it will settle into something like 60% of the deals are completed in person. Perhaps.</p><p> Where our experience will be quite consistent with the real estate industry is that the overwhelming majority of customer enquiries begin online.  Without anything other than instinct and empirical evidence I believe that is in reality already the case.</p><p> Future clients have begun their self-education, product and expertise selection, and conducted their due diligence on professionals online and via their peers &ndash; before we even know we are being considered as potential advisers.</p><p> <strong>  So where do you think the bulk of your future marketing efforts should be directed? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> How many times do you get the objection, &ldquo;Well, let me talk to my (partner, boss, manager, spouse, etc.)&rdquo;?  In any kind of sale, this is one of the most common objections or stalls prospects use.  And they use it because sales reps don&rsquo;t seem to have any effective come back to it.  Variations on this objection include:</p><p> &ldquo;Let me run this by&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get with&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Let me check with&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show this to my boss and see what he wants to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;m going to give you the right rebuttal to this and give you a real life example of how I used this &ndash; and what I learned &ndash; just this week while I was closing a prospect on one of my training programs. </p><p> I was speaking with a customer who had recently purchased one of my book of phone scripts.  I had never spoken to her before, but decided to call her and see how the scripts were working out for her. </p><p> During our conversation I learned what her company was about, what they sold and how many reps they had. <strong>    I established that she was one of the owners.  </strong></p><p> After listening to exactly what she was trying to accomplish, I suggested helping her by writing customized scripts and having her record those sales presentations so I could revise and perfect her scripted sales approach. </p><p> Then I asked how that sounded.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s when I got the objection above.  She said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run this by my partner&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Now this is where 80% of sales reps let the prospect go with, &ldquo;O.K., when should I follow up?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> That is the wrong thing to do.</p><p> Instead, the proper technique is to isolate this objection by taking the other decision maker out of it so you can gauge how your prospect truly feels about it. </p><p> Because let&rsquo;s face it: <strong>  if your prospect isn&rsquo;t sold, the other decision maker isn&rsquo;t going to be either </strong> &hellip;</p><p> So here&rsquo;s the close you need here: I told her: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, definitely show it to your partner.  <strong>  Let me ask you: If you&rsquo;re partner says it sounds good, what would you do then?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> And this is where this technique really pays off.  If she had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it!&rdquo; then I would have set some coaching times (nothing in stone; just set some tentative dates &ndash; another form of a trial close), but if she said what she did, then I would know exactly where I stood. </p><p> She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d then go back to my reps and tell them to use the scripts I just bought and see how it goes.  I&rsquo;d tell them I&rsquo;d already spent a lot of money on them and they needed to produce before I&rsquo;d be willing to spend more.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  How&rsquo;s that for a good answer? </strong></p><p> Now you&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;Good answer?  Mike, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like she&rsquo;s going to buy!&rdquo; </p><p> But that&rsquo;s O.K. </p><h3> Some will, some won&rsquo;t, who&rsquo;s next? </h3><p> <br/> You see, what&rsquo;s so good about this technique, and her honest answer, is that she revealed that she isn&rsquo;t going to be a deal.  That means I get to move on&hellip;</p><p> Compare this to how most sales reps would just schedule a call back and then begin chasing her? </p><p> <strong>  How many of these types of unqualified leads currently clog your pipeline? </strong></p><p> When I say this is the type of close to always have handy, I mean it.  Every time you find yourself in this situation, always, always, isolate this objection/stall to find out where you really stand. </p><p> It will save you tons of time (and frustration); time you can spend prospecting and finding real buyers&hellip;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Nicole Leong</p><p> Once upon a time, in a pre-integrated era, PR and search engine optimization (SEO) existed as two distinct entities, particularly in the financial services industry. Rarely were the two spoken of in the same breath. Traditional PR was the popular princess with the hair and the heels, and SEO was the bespectacled frog that no one gave a second look. Now, they&rsquo;re walking down the aisle ready to exchange vows. <strong>  What&rsquo;s changed? </strong></p><p> Well, Google&rsquo;s search results ranking algorithm, for one. It&rsquo;s constantly evolving. While no one could tell you exactly what it is, we do know that having your title tags in place, meta descriptions optimised and internal link structures organised can only get you so far in 2015. Now, to rank well on Google, much more importance is placed on quality of content, relevance and influential people talking about you. <strong>  Sound familiar? </strong></p><p> Then there&rsquo;s the fact that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/the-new-pr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   page 1 of Google search results is the new &ldquo;the front page&rdquo;  </a> </u> . Building and protecting your financial services brand&rsquo;s image now requires a new, integrated approach, because it&rsquo;s become pretty clear that your search results and reputation are directly linked.</p><h3> Both PR and SEO are, after all, about reaching the right people, making strategic connections and creating visibility for your brand, so it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise.</h3><p> <br/> We can think of modern marketing activities as divided into two approaches: there&rsquo;s outbound marketing, which PR falls under, along with traditional advertising. Then there&rsquo;s inbound marketing, in which SEO plays a leading role. Outbound marketing primarily revolves around creating new demand for your brand/product, whereas inbound marketing taps into existing demand by making your site easily found, letting your customers come to you. Employing both approaches in your integrated marketing strategy gives rise to a decidedly more holistic plan of attack for market penetration.</p><p> We&rsquo;re sure you get the theory by this point &hellip; But where to start in practice?</p><p> Try these ways to bring PR and SEO together &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll really see a difference.</p><h3> 1. Strategically plan and own your content</h3><p> <br/> Conduct in-depth keyword research and decide which search terms would be most beneficial for your business. Use those keywords to inform your brand&rsquo;s content strategy and content calendar to ensure that you are meeting your audience&rsquo;s information needs. Then, write the content with those keywords in mind and make sure your pages are optimised for them.</p><p> Always include those keywords in your company&rsquo;s media releases and train your spokespeople to use them in interviews to optimise publishers&rsquo; content about your company.</p><h3> 2. Build a strong backlink profile</h3><p> <br/> With the shift in Google&rsquo;s algorithm to a greater focus on quality content, links from external sites count as votes of confidence for your site. These &ldquo;votes&rdquo; are heavily weighted to favour links from reputable sources, so getting links from a mainstream news site such as the AFR (domain authority 83/100) and The Australian (domain authority 89/100) would do wonders for your site&rsquo;s SEO. Flex those media relations muscles and remember to include links to your content in press releases.</p><h3> 3. Outreach</h3><p> <br/> <u>  Bloggers and other online influencers are the new magazines and news outlets </u> . They come with huge, highly engaged followings, ready to be tapped into. Engaging in an influencer strategy makes sense from both SEO and PR perspectives since it would help raise your brand&rsquo;s profile as well as generate strong backlinks.</p><p> PR and SEO teams should put their expertise together to pick the right influencers in the financial services industry to work with. Through an SEO lens, influencers can be identified using quantitative factors such as online following, retweet ratios and domain authority; while a PR lens can be applied to filter the shortlist based on industry intel, alignment of values and existing relationships. Best practice for communication and building relationships can then be drawn from PR.</p><h3> 4. Know where to place your bets</h3><p> <br/> Through your site analytics, track the quality of visitors from each outlet. From our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/malcolm-turnbull-launches-onmarket-app-to-democratise-capital-raising/story-e6frfmdr-1227560677388\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent launch of a fintech app  </a> </u> , we learned that even though certain news outlets drew larger amounts of traffic, the average session duration was low and bounce rates high. With our ultimate objective being conversions, engaged visitors mattered more than sheer volume and we steered our focus to publications that might drive less, but higher quality traffic instead.</p><h3> 5. Measure and quantify your PR efforts</h3><p> <br/> Historically, the results of PR have been difficult to track. How precisely can one measure brand awareness? Public sentiment? Tallying media placements, reach and mentions serves to measure potential, not outcomes. Our digital savvy now allows us to put a figure on the percentage increase in branded searches, as a direct result of increased brand awareness, and the volume of traffic gained from links in earned media. Setting goals in Google Analytics gives us the low-down on conversion figures, attributed to each source. Back your hard work up with similarly hard figures.</p><p> How can your financial services firm better integrate the unlikely couple of PR and SEO?</p>",

    "link": "4-signs-youre-dealing-with-a-bad-recruiter",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Lauren Riley | <u>  Bubblejobs </u></p><p> Recruiters have a pretty mixed reputation amongst job seekers &ndash; on the one hand, they can find you the perfect job and talk you up to your ideal employer, but on the other hand, there are the bad eggs who only care about their commission and are pushy and uninterested in your own goals.</p><p> While most recruiters are passionate about their industry, there are always some that are more hassle than they&rsquo;re worth.</p><p> With that in mind, here are the top 4 signs you&rsquo;re working with a bad recruiter:</p><h3> 1. They Don&rsquo;t Listen To What You Want</h3><p> <br/> Normally when a recruiter contacts you, it&rsquo;s in regards to a particular role they&rsquo;re working on that they&rsquo;d like to put your CV forward for.</p><p> If the recruiter is trying to convince you to apply for the position after you&rsquo;ve said you&rsquo;re not interested, they&rsquo;re almost definitely not the ideal person to be working on your future.</p><p> Also, if they keep coming back to you with irrelevant roles even after you&rsquo;ve told them specifically what you&rsquo;re looking for, it may be time to get rid!</p><h3> 2. They Don&rsquo;t Offer Advice</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes you&rsquo;ll go for a job via a recruiter and you won&rsquo;t be successful &ndash; that&rsquo;s just the way of life &ndash; but if you&rsquo;re getting radio silence once you&rsquo;ve got the news &ndash; it may be a good time to look for a new recruiter.</p><p> A useful recruiter will follow up with you, give feedback from the employer and offer up ways you can improve on future application.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t waste your time chasing a recruiter who doesn&rsquo;t care about your personal development &ndash; it will become clear that they&rsquo;re only interested in their commission and it&rsquo;s not worth putting your future in their hands.</p><h3> 3. They&rsquo;re Impossible To Get Hold Of</h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest red flags when it comes to identifying a bad recruiter is how easy it is to get in contact with them.</p><p> If they regularly say they&rsquo;ll be in touch and don&rsquo;t get back to you, or you leave messages and send emails and get no response, then they&rsquo;re clearly unreliable and should be given the boot.</p><p> Obviously there are times when there&rsquo;s a good reason that they&rsquo;ve not been in contact, but if you start to identify a pattern emerging, it might be time to consider asking for a replacement recruiter.</p><h3> 4. They Don&rsquo;t Understand The Sector Or Your Background</h3><p> <br/> This is a big problem &ndash; especially in a large and complex industry like digital. A good recruiter will know their sector inside out (it&rsquo;s their job, after all!) and will know which roles you&rsquo;ll be more suited to than others.</p><p> A bad recruiter will assume that because you&rsquo;ve got skills in one area of digital, that you must be a fit for every digital role they&rsquo;re working on across the sector &ndash; and this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth!</p><p> If a recruiter keeps suggesting irrelevant roles that you&rsquo;re not qualified for or have experience of, or if they seem pretty clueless when talking through your skills and background &ndash; give them the boot!</p>",

Let me tell you, it&rsquo;s a sight to be seen. A few weeks ago, I was training a sales team on nonverbal science at a cutting edge software company. These teammates knew the drill: they knew each other and they knew exactly how to play up their strengths and cover each other&rsquo;s weaknesses. As they discussed pitching a big fish client, I listened in amazement as they strategized the details. It went something like this:</p><p> <strong>  Team Leader: </strong>  &ldquo;Alright, guys, we are going to deploy our Warm-Lead Plan with Client X. Tracy, that means you take first approach. Sound good?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Tracy: </strong>  &ldquo;Yeah, no problem. I&rsquo;m going to need Richard to run the numbers before the first meeting so I can blow them out of the water right out of the gate.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Richard: </strong>  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy, but I think with this client they are going to want a glossy spread. If I get the numbers to Jim by next week you think we can put together a magazine type brochure to leave with them?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Jim: </strong>  &ldquo;Oh yes, I think I can pull together a great leave behind. I think I should break it into 2 parts and then Team Leader can use Part II to follow up with them after meeting with Tracy.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Team Leader: </strong>  &ldquo;Done. I&rsquo;ll get it into my schedule to follow-up 3 days after Tracy gives me the lowdown from the intro meeting.&rdquo;</p><p> I have trained and worked with hundreds of teams in action and found there are very specific habits of top performing teams. This is one of the reasons I chose  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/10/team-genius/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Team Genius </a>  as one of our Science of People book club books. In this post, I want to explore the research done by Rich Karlgaard and Michael Malone for Team Genius and some of our own science behind effective teamwork.</p><h3> The Science of High Performing Teams:</h3><p> <br/> How can you effectively manage, integrate and join a team? Check out the tips below on how high functioning teams operate:</p><h3> Step #1: Self-Questions</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Do you know your team? </strong> Are you up for the challenges of transforming your group into a high-performing machine? Karlgaard and Malone kick-off their discussion of teams with a set of 20 self-questions. These are questions you should start asking before making big changes. I whittled these down to 5 power questions that will set the groundwork for your success:</p><li> Are you in the right team in the right moment?</li><li> Can your team stay ahead of the changes in your industry?</li><li> Are your teams the right size for the job?</li><li> Do you have the right people in the right positions on your team?</li><li> Is your team prepared for a crisis, disruption or change in leadership? <br/>  </li><h3> Step #2: The Pleasure in Team</h3><p> <br/> We like to think (especially in the US) that individual success is paramount. But in fact:</p><p> &ldquo;Humans are genetically wired for teams.&rdquo; &ndash;Team Genius</p><p> As humans we know that we need other people to forage enough food, help us build structures to live in and live beyond mere subsistence. Together we leverage many strengths.</p><p> <strong>  Prosociality: </strong> Kaarlgard and Malone argue that humans are wired to cooperate. So much so that we feel rewarded in the brain every time we help someone else&ndash;this is why giving back to others, donating money and helping our community feels so good.</p><p> Some researchers have studied how we as humans share resources. They have found that no matter your gender, race or ethnicity, people typically choose to share between 40 and 50% of what they have&ndash;even when the recipient is anonymous and there is no penalty for hogging!</p><p> Working well with other good people makes us feel good.</p><h3> Step #3: The Magic Number</h3><p> <br/> What is the ideal number of people for a team? Anthropologist Robin Dunbar has studied groups throughout history&ndash;everything from ancient religious communities to African tribes and found that the same human group sizes appear over and over again. He calls these &lsquo;clusters of intimacy&rsquo;:</p><li> <strong>  Clique:  </strong> 5 members</li><li> <strong>  Sympathy Group:  </strong> 12 to 15 members</li><li> <strong>  Bands: </strong>  Up to 35 members</li><li> <strong>  Dunbar&rsquo;s Number*: </strong>  147.8 members <br/>  </li><p> *Dunbar found that if a group expands to over 150 members it will split apart. They found, for example, that the Yanomamo people split their tribes in two every time their groups approach 200 members&ndash;and they have been doing this for centuries.</p><p> <strong>  Why is more than 150 too big? </strong> The brain cannot handle more than 150 connections at once. For every member of a group, the number of connections go up. A pair of people have one connection between them. A troika has 3 connections. A 4 member group has 6 connections. A 5 member group has 10 connections. The bigger the group, the more personalities, relationships and strengths to remember.</p><h3> Step #4: Team Chemistry</h3><p> <br/> Our Biology plays a big role in how we integrate with teams:</p><li> <strong>  Oxytocin:  </strong> Oxytocin is the hormone that helps us feel bonded to others. It is crucial for our empathy and social intelligence. Research has shown that oxytocin helps us identify facial gestures more quickly, it speeds up our processing of positive social information and enhances group trust. In other words, it is the chemical explanation behind team cohesion.</li><li> <strong>  Mirror Neurons:  </strong> Mirror neurons help us understand and filter what we see in the world. &ldquo;Italian neuroscientists found them by accident while monitoring a particular cell in a monkey&rsquo;s brain that fired only when the monkey raised its arm. One day a lab assistant lifted an ice cream cone to his own mouth and triggered a reaction in the monkey&rsquo;s cell. It was the first evidence that the brain is peppered with neurons that mimic, or mirror, what another being does. This previously unknown class of brain cells operates as neural Wi-Fi, allowing us to navigate our social world. When we consciously or unconsciously detect someone else&rsquo;s emotions through their actions, our mirror neurons reproduce those emotions. Collectively, these neurons create an instant sense of shared experience,&rdquo; said Dr. Daniel Goleman. <br/>  </li><p> Why is this important for us to know? Our biology is suited for us to have good team interactions. Don&rsquo;t fight it, embrace it. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><h3> Step #5: It&rsquo;s In the How</h3><p> <br/> Dr. Daniel Goleman performed a study called Social Intelligence and the Biology of Leadership and found that how we communicate with our teammates is just as important as what we communicate. In a  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2008/09/social-intelligence-and-the-biology-of-leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review article  </a> </u> , he explains it this way:</p><p> &ldquo;In a recent study, our colleague Marie Dasborough observed two groups: One received negative performance feedback accompanied by positive emotional signals&mdash;namely, nods and smiles; the other was given positive feedback that was delivered critically, with frowns and narrowed eyes. In subsequent interviews conducted to compare the emotional states of the two groups, the people who had received positive feedback accompanied by negative emotional signals reported feeling worse about their performance than did the participants who had received good-natured negative feedback. In effect, the delivery was more important than the message itself. And everybody knows that when people feel better, they perform better.&rdquo;</p><h3> This is crucially important. The best teams don&rsquo;t have to be problem free. Nor do team members have to shirk from challenges or honest feedback. Directness + Warmth is key.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Goleman shares this example: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;It certainly made a difference at one university-based hospital in Boston. Two doctors we&rsquo;ll call Dr. Burke and Dr. Humboldt were in contention for the post of CEO of the corporation that ran this hospital and others. Both of them headed up departments, were superb physicians, and had published many widely cited research articles in prestigious medical journals. But the two had very different personalities. Burke was intense, task focused, and impersonal. He was a relentless perfectionist with a combative tone that kept his staff continually on edge. Humboldt was no less demanding, but he was very approachable, even playful, in relating to staff, colleagues, and patients. Observers noted that people smiled and teased one another&mdash;and even spoke their minds&mdash;more in Humboldt&rsquo;s department than in Burke&rsquo;s. Prized talent often ended up leaving Burke&rsquo;s department; in contrast, outstanding folks gravitated to Humboldt&rsquo;s warmer working climate. Recognizing Humboldt&rsquo;s socially intelligent leadership style, the hospital corporation&rsquo;s board picked him as the new CEO.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Bottom Line: </strong>  Share laughs, show open body language, lean in and build nonverbal warmth as you verbally get to know each other.</p><h3> Step #6: Prosocial Behaviors</h3><p> <br/> I want to take the last point one step further. When I talk about nonverbal warmth, I am talking about that difficult to master, but amazingly powerful quality called rapport. Rapport is when team members who show genuine respect and likeness towards one another even during challenges. There are 3 different prosocial behaviors that elicit nonverbal warmth and happier teams:</p><li> <strong>  Humor: </strong>  The top rated leaders have been shown on average to elicit laughter from their subordinates at least twice as often as their less successful counterparts. Funny is worth the effort. My friend  <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/7-comedic-habits-to-be-consistently-funnier-presenting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  David Nihill </a>  is amazing at helping anyone become funnier.</li><li> <strong>  Happiness: </strong>  &ldquo;When leaders display happiness, it improves their followers&rsquo; creative performance&ndash;and interestingly, when they&rsquo;re sad, it enhances those same followers&rsquo; analytical performance. In other words, when the team members think the boss is happy, they feel liberated to try out new ideas; and when they think the boss is unhappy they hunker down into survival mode.&rdquo; -Team Genius.</li><li> <strong>  Cooperation: </strong>  Kaarlgard and Malone also report that when team members witness cooperative behaviors they tend to feel a greater sense of morality&ndash;making them even more likely to cooperate. Plainly, small acts of cooperation encourage bigger ones. <br/>  </li><h3> Step #7: Extroverts vs. Introverts</h3><p> <br/> I found one small point in the book highly interesting&ndash;how do you balance group over-contributors and group under-contributors? Here are some interesting facts and tips:</p><li> <strong>  Fact:  </strong> Teams tend to assign more weight to the contributions of their extroverted members&ndash;these teammates also contribute the most.</li><li> <strong>  Tip:  </strong> Researcher Bonner found that the only safe way to get more accurate contributions is to make data highly visible and share the accuracy of each member&rsquo;s ideas.</li><li> <strong>  Tip:  </strong> If introverts feel uncomfortable sharing ideas, a formal mechanism for sharing needs to be put in place. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Special Note: </strong>  Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re an introvert or extrovert? Me neither!  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2014/12/ambivert-extrovert-introvert/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I am an ambivert, are you?  </a> </u></p><h3> Step #8: Learn As We</h3><p> <br/> Not only do teams outperform individuals, but also individuals tend to learn better if they are learning as part of a group. ( <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why Groups Perform Better Than Individuals  </a> </u> ). When you learn alone you don&rsquo;t have people to brainstorm with or challenge your opinions. Team learning is an important benefit of team genius. Instead of having team members research and report back, try having teams learn as a group and teach each other small parts of a larger problem that has to be pieced together. This is a great team building exercise and can help reset verbal feedback and speaking patterns.</p><li> <strong>  Warning:  </strong> Avoid the echo chamber. &lsquo;Learning&rsquo; is not voicing or repeating the same ideas. Learning is about challenging, questioning and probing ideas. <br/>  </li><h3> Step #9: Communication Patterns</h3><p> <br/> I love the work by Alex Pentland, director of MIT&rsquo;s Human Dynamics Lab, and he uses a &lsquo;sociometer&rsquo; to track communication patterns between people. He found that there are patterns of communication between great teams. I summarized the major differences here for you:</p><li> <strong>  High Frequency:  </strong> The best teams typically exchange communications a dozen or so or times per working hour.</li><li> <strong>  Talk Ratio: </strong>  The best teams have members that talk and listen in equal measure.</li><li> <strong>  Outside Sources:  </strong> Pentland found that the best teams tend to connect with multiple outside sources frequently when they feel their team is lacking in an area. <br/>  </li><p> I was SHOCKED to see how often strong teams communicate and how they do so. Merely talking about ideal frequency of communication between team members can be extremely clarifying.</p><h3> Step #10: Team Neurodynamics</h3><p> <br/> Whether you are already on a team or are working on forming one you need to understand your team&rsquo;s brain power. Kaarlgard and Malone give an in-depth discussion of how your team&rsquo;s brain power works, but here are some of the most salient tips:</p><li> <strong>  Metamemory: </strong>  One interesting aspect of team knowledge was something that I had never considered&ndash;knowledge of our knowledge. Metamemory is when teammates have a common understanding of who knows what, which member has a particular skill set and what the team and each member doesn&rsquo;t know. When you know what you know and what you don&rsquo;t know you can assign tasks, solve problems, get help and brainstorm much faster.</li><li> <strong>  Cognitive Diversity:  </strong> One of the most provocative discussions in the book was about diversity. The authors argue that teams need skill diversity as much as they need racial, gender and economic diversity. They call these whole-brain teams. The question is: how diverse are your team&rsquo;s skill levels? Do you have all of the brain power you need? <br/>  </li><h3> Team Take-Aways:</h3><p> There are so many nuggets in here for teams and the best tips differ depending on your team&rsquo;s size, goals and history. I have to say, I struggled with this article because some of the tips are best for team managers, while others are best for team players and others still are for people who want to create teams but haven&rsquo;t yet. Hopefully this post has given you some insight to how powerfully teams can be leveraged. Here are some big ideas for you to consider:</p><li> <strong>  Establish norms of communication for your team&ndash;how, when and how often. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Take stock of your cognitive talents and bring transparency to the data. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Devise a process for learning together. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Want a Science of People trainer to help at your next offsite or retreat?

    "title": "Why Banks Need to Be More Social",
    "link": "why-banks-need-to-be-more-social",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> More and more banks are getting to be social, but there&rsquo;s still a long way to go.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s interesting that I&rsquo;ve noticed a number of banks investing heavily in social media over the past five years, but not in countries you would expect.  <strong>  Turkey, India, China, Brazil and Poland come to mind as social financial leaders, whilst America and most of Europe are still way behind.  </strong> What&rsquo;s the difference between nations, and why are US and European banks falling behind?</p><p> <strong>  I personally put it down to fear of regulations and an inability to adapt.  </strong> If you look at the countries where social engagement is happening fast, then these are the economies that twenty years ago were &lsquo;emerging&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ve now emerged and are leading. In Turkey, Deniz Bank and Akbank are both embedded in Facebook.  mBank, Alior Bank and others in Poland have been first movers in social payments. Banco Original is creating a whole new way of banking in Brazil via Facebook, whilst China&rsquo;s WeChat has created WeBank.</p><p> <strong>  My favourite example of social banking is in India however.  </strong> India&rsquo;s ICICI Bank moved to full-time customer service engagement via Facebook in 2012.  What I mean by this is they immersed the bank as a Facebook app, so that customers can do all their banking via Facebook.  It looks like Facebook, feels like Facebook, works like Facebook, but it&rsquo;s not Facebook. It&rsquo;s just a Facebook front-end to the banking system that is the same secure system you can access via Internet Explorer, if you prefer.  And that&rsquo;s the trick: recognising that Facebook is effectively the homepage browser for many users.  Because ICICI Bank gets that, they not only have embedded the bank functionality into a Facebook app, but they&rsquo;ve moved many of their branch service people into Facebook.  24*7 customer service is provided through their Facebook page, and their engagement with their customer is dedicated to being social.</p><p> <strong>  The result is not only a transformation in customer engagement but also in the general customer view.  </strong> For example, before using Facebook for customer engagement, 24% of the online mentions of ICICI were negative and only 19% positive.  A year later, 49% of online comment were positive and just 6% negative.  That&rsquo;s a massive change and shows that a key part of the use of Facebook banking is for customer servicing, not just engagement.</p><p> <strong>  However, when I look at European and American banks, I find a very different story.  </strong> Most European and American banks have twitter accounts and Facebook pages, but they are purely there for marketing and PR purposes. No UK bank has a decent blog to follow and little of what they do is social.  Even in the US, the examples of dedicated social activity is limited. Probably the best of the bunch is Wells Fargo who, being aligned with Silicon Valley in physical location, at least get some of this.</p><p> <strong>  I always remember Wells Fargo&rsquo;s story of when they started blogging. </strong>  It was to commemorate the centenary of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, and hence was called  <u>  Guided by History </u> .  Shortly after, Wells became active on YouTube and have since been a proponent of Facebook, Twitter and other social media, both for marketing purposes and customer engagement.  <strong>  My UK bank colleague asked the Head of Marketing at Wells: why do you blog? The answer was: To have a voice. </strong></p><p> <strong>  The bottom-line is clear: if you&rsquo;re not engaging socially then you&rsquo;re mute and silence is not golden. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Freedom &ndash; it&rsquo;s my jam.   </strong> There, I said it out loud and put it into the universe.  I don&rsquo;t want to be responsible for making sure someone gets to work on time or dresses according to the company&rsquo;s employee manual.  It hurts my brain thinking about those things.  Do I manage people?  Yep, but do I REALLY want to be the boss?  Nope, I want to do things LIKE A BOSS.</p><h3> In order to #BeTheBoss &ndash; you must: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Be A Box Checker.  </strong>  Ugh &ndash; the dreaded Employee Manual, Rules of Engagement, Guidelines, Suggested this-and-that.  Whatever you call these box checking things, I simply can&rsquo;t stand them.  I&rsquo;m not a box checker, folks.  If I&rsquo;m working with someone and they think, &ldquo;This advisor should have (fill in the blank)&rdquo; then I&rsquo;m all for empowering that person do whatever it takes to make that advisor happy. Ultimately, I have a servant mentality, I suppose.  &ldquo;Do unto others..&rdquo; makes a whole lotta sense to me.  Call me crazy, I guess.</li><li> <strong>  Be A Know It All.   </strong> Um&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know it all.  I can&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m a human being, not a computer.  However, I know a lot of people who know more things than I do and I&rsquo;m more than happy to connect you to them.  Beware, I might want to sit and listen with you though so I can learn too.  This old dog likes new tricks!</li><li> <strong>  Be A Credit Taker.  </strong>  This is the thing that drives me most nuts.  If you didn&rsquo;t do the work, you don&rsquo;t get the credit.  Period.  You should always be willing to say, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this cool?  Guess what?  Let me introduce you to the person who made this possible&hellip;&rdquo; and give credit where it&rsquo;s due. <br/>  </li><h3> In order to do things #LikeABoss though &ndash; we must: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Be Enthusiastic.   </strong> This enthusiasm must be over-the-top to the point of contagious:  think viral.  You must infuse the people you are around with a delight they never knew was possible.  This is how you do your work like a boss!  Bring your passion!  Bring your drive.  Spunky people make stuff happen!</li><li> <strong>  Be Dirty.   </strong> You should be down in the trenches doing the work with everyone else.  This not only makes you relatable, but it makes you appreciate the actual job being done.  My 27-year old son, Justin, worked at Lowe&rsquo;s for many years when he was in high school.  He always told me when a guy walked in with fancy tennis shoes and clean shorts, he would politely greet the customer and walk past them to the guy wearing bib overalls, with dirt around his fingernails and a dusty ball cap.  At a young age, he knew this customer was there to spend money.  This hardworking fella was doing his work like a boss!</li><li> <strong>  Be a Credit Giver.  </strong>  I had to bring up this topic again as it&rsquo;s near and dear to my heart.  A. Whitney Griswold wrote, &ldquo;Creative ideas do not spring forth from groups.  They spring from individuals.&rdquo;  Do yourself a favor:  build others up like a boss!  It&rsquo;s the right thing to do&hellip;always. <br/>  </li><p> So go into your days this week and question if you are being a boss or doing things like a boss.  It may seem like a silly difference in words, but in these few examples you are able to see the small differences really are a big deal.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today.</p>",

    "title": "Three Estate Planning Questions for Business Owners",
    "link": "three-estate-planning-questions-for-business-owners",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> According to the  <u>  American College of Financial Services </u> , \"The ultimate goal of estate planning is to fulfill the estate owner&rsquo;s wishes as closely as possible.\"</p><p> If we accept this common definition of estate planning, estate planners must have the answers to these three estate-planning questions: If the proverbial Mack truck hits you today:</p><li> <strong>  Will your business continue without you? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will your designated successor run the business, with minimal disruption? </strong></li><li> <strong>  And if your business sells for its full value and your family receives the cash today, will the current income you spend today continue for your spouse's lifetime? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Most owners have not been asked these questions, nor have they given much thought to possible answers.  Exit Planning provides a path to ask these questions in the context of lifetime exiting. In answering these lifetime-centered questions, owners must articulate their lifetime goals regarding business ownership and family financial-wellbeing and you use them to create their estate plans.</p><h3> Estate Planning For Business Owners</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s look at an example of how goal-based estate planning for business owners plays out in a fairly straightforward situation.</p><p> Your owner-client has determined that when she exits her business (presumable alive!):</p><li> <strong>  She needs $250,000 of income per year for the rest of her life (and that of her spouse), </strong></li><li> <strong>  She wants to transfer the business to two key employees, and </strong></li><li> <strong>  She wants to be certain that other employees&rsquo; positions are secure at the company after she transfers the business. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> In setting her lifetime or exit planning goals, this owner, like most, has also set her estate planning goals.  Your job is to make sure she achieves them&mdash;whether she leaves her business dead or alive!</p><p> To do so, you must craft (or modify existing) business continuity arrangements as well as create (or modify existing) estate planning arrangements to reflect the owner&rsquo;s clearly articulated lifetime and &ldquo;at death&rdquo; wishes.</p><p> Of course the pressing question is: can the owner's wishes listed above be attained should she depart from this earth or her business tomorrow?  The ability to answer this question (and taking advantage of the opportunity it offers) separates every-day planners from great ones.</p><p> Consider that most owners want to exit their businesses within the next 10 years. <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/three-estate-planning-questions-business-owners#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a>  You can safely assume that these owners have given (or are willing to give) far more thought to what they want and need (for themselves, family and business) when they exit in the near or not-too-distant future than they have to what will happen (to their families and businesses) upon their one-day-but-not-any-day-soon demise</p><p> You must capitalize on their willingness to focus on today.  That focus creates urgency that you can use to open a discussion about that other day: the day they die.  Certainly owners are more receptive to your appraisals of how they can reach their lifetime goals than they are to discussions of what they will need should they not make it to retirement.  To open the discussion and link lifetime goals and estate planning objectives, start with the three questions listed at the outset of this article modified as follows:</p><li> <strong>  If you left your business today, never to return, could it continue, with minimal disruption, in your absence?  </strong> Would this be true whether your absence was due to a lifetime decision or to your death?</li><li> <strong>  If you left the business today, never to return, could your designated successor run the business, with minimal disruption? </strong> Would this be true whether your absence was due to a lifetime decision or your death?</li><li> <strong>  If you sold the business for its full value and received cash today, would your income continue for your and your spouse's lifetime, with minimal disruption? </strong> Would this be true whether your absence was due to a lifetime decision or your death? <br/>  </li><p> Once you engage owners in Exit Planning they begin to: 1) understand the gap between existing resources and capabilities and those needed to permit a successful exit, 2) see that the same gap exists if they die, and 3) take action to bridge the gap.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t already included estate-planning professionals in your network of professional advisors, do so.  Look for professionals who see the value in linking lifetime (or Exit Planning) and estate planning goals and have the expertise to create business continuity arrangements that are consistent with estate planning solutions. They play an important role on your Advisor Teams at the beginning and throughout your exit planning engagements.</p>",

    "link": "giving-a-presentation-9-ways-to-answer-questions-like-a-pro",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> I won&rsquo;t give a presentation because I&rsquo;m petrified about answering questions.</h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t like giving presentations, but I really dislike the Q&amp;A session.</p><p> I never know what to say when asked a question, and end up rambling.  </p><p> Comedian Jerry Seinfeld said, &ldquo;Did you know that they say people fear public speaking more than they fear death? That means that more people would rather be inside the coffin than giving the eulogy!&rdquo;</p><p> Many people fear giving presentations. Yet, as the above three quotes illustrate, there are people in my seminars who dislike the Q&amp;A part of a presentation the most. They seem to dread losing control of the presentation, or being caught off guard.</p><p> Effectively answering questions in front of your audience builds your credibility. Master the following points so you appear poised and confident during the Q&amp;A: </p><p> <strong>  1. Prepare for questions.  </strong> As you prepare your presentation, you also need to prepare for the questions you may be asked.  Think about your topic and who is in your audience, and how they are likely to respond. Anticipate the questions and know how you will answer them. </p><p> <strong>  2. Anticipate the tough questions. </strong> Think about what difficult, annoying or nasty questions you may be asked, and know how you will respond. Don&rsquo;t just pray that someone won&rsquo;t askthat question. Know how you will answer it.</p><p> <strong>  3. Repeat the question before answering.  </strong> This is hard to remember to do, but very important. You repeat the question for a number of reasons. The first is that when you repeat the question, it allows everyone to hear what was asked. You also gain a couple of seconds to get your thoughts together. And if the question is a hostile one, you can paraphrase the question and eliminate the hostility.  For example, if the question is, &ldquo;How come you are spending so much money on transportation for...,&rdquo; you could paraphrase and say something like, &ldquo;The question concerns the transportation budget.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t be a puppet on your audience&rsquo;s string. </strong>  If the audience is shouting questions at you, make sure you repeat the question you are about to answer. If you don&rsquo;t, you are being controlled by the audience as you quickly answer one question after another. When you take the time to repeat the question, you gain control of the Q&amp;A, as you are deciding which questions to address and in what order.</p><p> <strong>  5. Look at the audience when answering the question.  </strong> When you repeat the question, look at the person who asked it. But when you answer the question, look at the audience, to include them in the answer.</p><p> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t know the answer? </strong> Admit it. Even when you are well-prepared, there still may be times you are asked a question to which you don&rsquo;t know the answer. When that happens, you can usually say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I will find out and get back to you.&rdquo; And make sure you do. </p><p> <strong>  7. Give your Best Educated Guess.  </strong> Occasionally, there may be times when you don&rsquo;t know the answer, but you have to respond. You can then give what I call your Best Educated Guess. This is not lying. It&rsquo;s a general response without being specific. It is saying something like, &ldquo;Based on my experience (or research, or knowledge of...), I assume the following would occur....&rdquo;  (But make sure it is your best educated guess &ndash; don&rsquo;t go beyond the boundaries of what is plausible.)</p><p> <strong>  8. Defer answering, if the answer to the question will be explained later in your talk.  </strong> Often, you can say, &ldquo;I am going to hold off answering that question as I will be discussing that topic in a few minutes.&rdquo; Of course, if the CEO asked the question, you may want to answer it right away! </p><p> <strong>  9. Don&rsquo;t end abruptly.  </strong> When the Q&amp;A segment is nearing its end, prepare the audience. You can say something like, &ldquo;I have time for one more question.&rdquo; And after you answer that question, move on to your closing.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> 2016 could be marked in the record books as the &ldquo;year of great change&rdquo; as retention packages expire and advisors are free to shop around for a new home.</h3><p> <br/> The emotional and financial freedom that many advisors have been waiting for is set to arrive in early 2016. <strong>  That&rsquo;s when the notes attached to retention packages offered in the wake of the financial crisis to more than 5,000 advisors are set to expire. </strong></p><p> These retention packages were structured as forgivable loans, thus the amount of money that most advisors would owe back if they were to leave their firm prior to the end of the note is negligible at this point; so it isn&rsquo;t really the financial ties that should be the most binding. After all, the transition packages being offered to advisors at any production level to incent recruitment are at high water marks and certainly more than enough to make up for what one would owe back if he were to leave early. It is the emotional freedom, though, that will likely have the greatest impact on quality advisors who feel a sense of commitment to fulfilling an obligation completely.</p><p> To be sure, the wirehouses are vulnerable to losing more quality advisors as they reach free agency and unless the firms find a way to make these folks feel more wanted, supported, and economically rewarded for their loyalty, the losses could be significant. In the absence of even the slightest gesture by management at their firms, these advisors are much more likely to be wooed by the promise of additional support, love, and an outsized transition deal&mdash;even if they know that life won&rsquo;t be that different at another wirehouse. And, certainly, if independence is what an advisor would consider as his next step &ndash; offering the opportunity to gain freedom, flexibility, control and the ability to build real enterprise value &ndash; it could cause an even greater diaspora.</p><p> &ldquo;Robert&rdquo; said it best when he told me that he was &ldquo;just biding his time.&rdquo; Feeling frustrated by bureaucracy and therefore limited by his ability to grow his business and service his clients the way he wants to, he is considering leaving his bank owned firm for the first time in his 30 year career. He acknowledges that what he would owe back to his firm if he were to leave before 2016 is &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; compared to what he is being offered elsewhere, but despite his frustrations, he won&rsquo;t even entertain the notion of a move until his retention deal is fully forgiven.</p><p> I have great respect for Robert&rsquo;s sense of obligation, though I think that part of what drives it is the &ldquo;hope&rdquo; that his firm will offer him some additional incentive to stay put. Personally, I&rsquo;m skeptical about this happening, but I can&rsquo;t blame those that are wishing for it&mdash;because it is much easier to stay than to go.</p><h3> From a recruiting perspective, 2016 promises to be an interesting year as the balance of power will have clearly shifted to the advisor and the waterfall of opportunities elsewhere has expanded exponentially.</h3><p> <br/> Wirehouses will need to look carefully at their top players and understand &ndash; and deliver &ndash; what it takes to retain winning teams. And winning teams are not just built upon compensation: quality players look at culture, support, and flexibility. Those firms that can&rsquo;t look beyond their current structure are likely to lose the most players.</p><p> <strong>  For those advisors who are on the sidelines waiting to become free agents: this truly is your time. </strong> Much like the NBA draft, there will be a great deal of opportunity dangling before you; it&rsquo;s your job to examine the landscape carefully to identify the one that will provide you and your clients with the best possible future. While some of you are still hanging on to hopes that your current firm will come through with another retention deal and a good reason to stay put, keep in mind that as a quality advisor, you likely have plenty of options to choose from. The key is to take the time now to scan the landscape and open your mind to new possibilities, because fruitful times &ndash; and the potential for great change &ndash; like this only come around once every 8 years or so.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Fund companies used to have a writer sit down with a portfolio manager (PM) to hear how the PM&rsquo;s fund did over the past reporting period, and then the writer would distill that information into a concise commentary for the PM to review and approve.</p><h3> Not anymore.</h3><p> <br/> More and more companies are looking for alternatives to getting their marketing and regulatory commentaries written in a convenient fashion. Also, the large number and types of funds available today makes the face-to-face approach nearly impossible, given the time constraints that PMs have to deal with.</p><p> And, because fund companies have to create these commentaries quickly as a result of regulatory or other delivery requirements, in-house copywriting resources are often not an option for this volume of work.</p><p> The answer? Combine automation tools and best practices with a professional commentary writing service. Here is how to break it down:</p><h3> What to automate and what to keep custom</h3><p> <br/> From experience, we&rsquo;ve found that combining automation and customization at specific points in the commentary process is the best way to alleviate pressure on your PMs, while also meeting all of your regulatory and compliance needs.</p><p> There are lots of ways to use technology to streamline the commentary process. For starters, data can be pulled from attribution reports to create individual commentary shells for each fund mandate.</p><p> Ext. Marketing Inc., for example, uses custom reporting templates that PMs or their analysts fill out to reduce the amount of time required by PMs to complete their commentaries. These commentaries are written, edited and proofread by experienced and knowledgeable financial services writers.</p><h3> Outsourcing can improve your process</h3><p> <br/> Outsourcing this work to a professional financial services commentary provider that can leverage technology to streamline the commentary process &ndash; and provide a well-crafted commentary that maintains the voice of the PM &ndash; is a great option. Outsourcing:</p><li> <strong>  Often produces commentaries faster than using in-house resources </strong></li><li> <strong>  Expands the ability to research and add the &ldquo;whys&rdquo; after attribution information has been determined </strong></li><li> <strong>  Includes editing as part of the process, so commentaries are returned to clients cleaner </strong></li><li> <strong>  Completes engaging macroeconomic/market review and outlook sections, before the period has ended if required </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ensures all regulatory requirements are met </strong> <br/>  </li><p> With some strategic thinking about where automation and customization can improve your process, PM commentaries no longer have to strain you and your company&rsquo;s resources.</p>",

    "content": "<p> People have the unique ability to empathize with those around them. Whether it&rsquo;s a coworker facing a layoff, or a close friend getting married, we have the ability to put ourselves in their shoes and understand their pain or happiness. Empathy is an important component of emotional intelligence&mdash;if we can relate to others&rsquo; feelings, we can adapt our responses accordingly.  </p><p> <strong>  Successful business leaders need to have empathy in order to be inclusive of others. </strong> It&rsquo;s important when determining if employees are comfortable with the corporate culture, for instance, and it allows leaders to better relate to staff, customers and vendors. Many people think that our ability to empathize strengthens when we&rsquo;re dealing with people whose experiences are similar to our own.   </p><p> But, Rachel Ruttan, Mary-Hunter McDonnell, and Loran Nordgren are here to suggest otherwise. In their Harvard Business Review article,  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/10/its-harder-to-empathize-with-people-if-youve-been-in-their-shoes?utm_source=Socialflow&amp;utm_medium=Tweet&amp;utm_campaign=Socialflow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   It&rsquo;s Harder to Empathize with People If You&rsquo;ve Been in Their Shoes  </u>  ,&rdquo; </a>  the authors discuss their latest research, which tells us that someone who has already &ldquo;been there&rdquo; may, actually, be less likely to be appropriately empathetic than someone who hasn&rsquo;t experienced what the other person is going through.</p><p> The researchers suggest two different reasons for why this may happen. One is called the &ldquo;empathy gap.&rdquo; The researchers explain: &ldquo;Though we may remember that a past experience was painful, stressful, or emotionally trying, we tend to underestimate just how painful that experience felt in the moment.&rdquo; In other words, because we aren&rsquo;t living in that painful moment, we&rsquo;re not able to accurately recall the emotions at that time. On the other hand, someone who never experienced the situation can better imagine how painful or emotional the situation might be because they have nothing to compare it to.</p><p> The other reason for this lack of appropriate empathy is due to the &ldquo;I got through it, and so can you&rdquo; mentality. According to the researchers, &ldquo;people who have previously overcome an aversive experience know that they were able to successfully overcome it, which makes them feel especially confident about their understanding of just how difficult the situation is.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The last thing a leader wants to be seen as is cold and without empathy for others around them. </strong> How do we fight the apparent instinct to downplay someone else&rsquo;s emotions because we believe we&rsquo;ve experienced these same emotions before? The researchers suggest that &ldquo;leaders need get outside of their own heads&mdash;to place less emphasis, not more, on their own past challenges.&rdquo; Leaders need to put more focus on the person they&rsquo;re trying to help and on understanding the other person&rsquo;s feelings instead of comparing the situation to their own.</p><p> Being inclusive of others is being inclusive of how other people feel. <strong>  Don&rsquo;t let your past experiences keep you from understanding those around you appropriately. Listen to learn.  </strong></p>",

They've Seen This Movie Before</h3><p> <br/> If you have to start with &ldquo;This time is really different,&rdquo; for goodness sake, take three steps back and be sure that is true. You can only say that once with real credibility.</p><h3> 2. They Don't Trust You</h3><p> <br/> Ouch. This one&rsquo;s a harder nut to crack, and it just might be true. Don&rsquo;t continue to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; this until you work on the bigger issue. Check yourself first, are your motives in their best interest? Do you trust them enougth to share real information (if you don&rsquo;t trust them, they won&rsquo;t trust you)? Are you taking time to really listen to their concerns?

You&rsquo;re out there with the right motives, connecting and doing the right thing, but they&rsquo;ve been burned before. Don&rsquo;t trash the last guy, but just keep showing up consistently to and doing the right thing again and again.

They Don't Understand Why This Matters</h3><p> <br/> Remember you&rsquo;ve had lots of time to think about this and it makes perfect sense to you. Back up a few steps and remember some of your earlier concerns. Take time to really consider how this must look from their perspective. Develop a tight communciation strategy to consistently explain why this matters so much, be sure to include right brain (stories and emotions) and left brain appeals (facts, figures and evidence).</p><h3> 5. They Don't Think It Will Work</h3><p> <br/> Ahh, well if you&rsquo;re a regular reader, you know the best way to fix this is by breaking it down, and building  <u>  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/confidence_bursts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   confidence and competence in bursts.  </a> </u></p><p> Pushing harder just invites push-back.

Take the team out of the office for a day trip to do something seasonal. Think a corn maze, apple picking, or something else that will put your employees in the festive spirit.</p><h3> 3. Write handwritten notes</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes something as simple as a handwritten note detailing what you appreciate about an employee is the most effective thing in the world.</p><h3> 4. Throw a Worksgiving</h3><p> <br/> Have everyone on the team bring in a Thanksgiving dish potluck style ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-easy-dishes-thanksgiving-potlucks-at-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   if you need some ideas, we have 'em!  </a> </u> ), and treat the team to the main event: the turkey. Play some music and make the whole afternoon a holiday party.</p><h3> 5. Bring in treats every day for a week</h3><p> <br/> Bring in donuts, cupcakes, or, to make it even more festive, pumpkin cookies or pecan pie. Do this every day for a week to make the celebration last for days.</p><h3> 6. Do one favor</h3><p> <br/> If your team is small enough, tell each member of your team you&rsquo;ll do one favor for them. Whether it&rsquo;s bringing in their favorite lunch, taking a task off their to-do list, or letting them come in late one morning &mdash; you&rsquo;ll handle it.</p><h3> 7. Sing their praises</h3><p> <br/> Send around a newsletter near Thanksgiving that showcases each employee&rsquo;s personal and professional achievements so the entire office can see how valuable they are.</p><h3> 8. Make a Wall of Fame</h3><p> <br/> Put each employee&rsquo;s picture on the wall under &ldquo;Wall of Fame&rdquo; and write a small description under each about the things they are best at and some of their biggest accomplishments.</p><h3> 9. Go on an elaborate coffee run</h3><p> <br/> Come into the office in the morning with each member of your team&rsquo;s specific coffee order, whether it&rsquo;s a classic drip with two creams, an iced mocha, or a pumpkin spice latte.</p><h3> 10. Host an ice cream social</h3><p> <br/> Bring in tubs of ice cream with all the fixings &mdash; sprinkles, cherries, hot fudge, whipped cream &mdash; and spend the afternoon making the best sundaes.</p><h3> 11. Hold an impromptu meeting</h3><p> <br/> This isn&rsquo;t an ordinary meeting. Bring the team into a conference room for a surprise meeting, dish out some treats, and take the opportunity to say out loud just how thankful you are for each and every one of them. </p><p> Thanksgiving is the perfect time to show employee appreciation. Take the opportunity to find a fun way to show that you care about your employees as human beings.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> In my corporate sales days, I wondered what the difference was between top producers and those who were not. It became evident two major factors were involved:</p><h3> Resilience and perseverance lead to more sales</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a simple enough concept. But the problem was, and always will be, the fear of prospects becoming extremely angry due to the follow-up.  Similarly, it&rsquo;s critical for job seekers on interviews to ask if they are the type of candidate being sought, and when the expected start date might be.</p><p> The fix is the communication style. Below are suggestions that will prevent anger 99% of the time. And by diligently following up in style, you will further build relationships and earn the sale.</p><h3> Communication strategy</h3><p> <br/> When you are speaking with potential clientele, you may hear &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Ask the following quesitons first:</p><li> <strong>  Did I answer all of your questions or is something still unclear? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Is your &ldquo;no&rdquo; forever or will another time be better? </strong></li><li> <strong>  If down the road, what needs to be in place first in order to move forward? </strong></li><li> <strong>  When and how would you like me to follow up? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Follow-up  </h3><p> <br/> Those who are in the range of &ldquo;somewhat&rdquo; to &ldquo;truly interested&rdquo; will provide you with a date and method for follow-up. The first statement whether verbal or written, should be similar to, &ldquo;Can you believe how fast the time past? Last March you suggested I contact you today. Is this still a good time for you to pick up the conversation?&rdquo;</p><p> If you hear &ldquo;no&rdquo;, ask for a better time and promise to follow-up again. And with a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; ask what changes have been made since you last spoke.</p><p> Instead of having an irate person on the other end, she will be thrilled to speak with you to give you her updates. When finished, it will be your turn to provide your updates. From this point, your will move closer to securing the sale.</p><h3> Mechanics of Follow-up</h3><p> <br/> There is no getting around the subject, but you do need to capture the information of everyone you encounter. It will be virtually impossible to remember the name and title of every person at every company.</p><p> Compounding the matter, people switch jobs and that information needs to be captured, too. And then there is the on-going need to continually feed your pipeline with more and more contacts.</p><p> The only way to manage the vast amount of data collected is to use a CRM system or database. Different types of business models such as global teams or a single entrepreneur will dictate the type of CRM to invest in.   A wide variety of options exist today.</p><p> Each system has a different focus and it&rsquo;s important to pick the one that best suits your business model, ease of use, and budget. Implementing daily usage will keep you on track for efficient follow-up.</p><p> Using these tips you will be adept at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smooth Sale!  </a> </u></p>",

    "title": "5 Blogging Commandments for Financial Services Firms",
    "link": "5-blogging-commandments-for-financial-services-firms",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Lauren Davis </u></p><p> Want to make your financial services firm&rsquo;s marketing engine hum? Ditch the idea that having a blog is an optional thing. Recast the &ldquo;if I get to it&rdquo; sidebar project that characterizes most firms&rsquo; blogging efforts into the hub of all your outbound media relations and thought leadership efforts.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve come far enough to know that there is no mystery in how to launch a blog. The key is figuring out how to make it successful as a core part of your marketing and communications efforts. With that in mind, here are the five commandments financial services professionals should follow so their blog regularly produces professional, polished and educational content.</p><h3> I. Thou shall have an editorial calendar</h3><p> <br/> An editorial calendar is a well thought-out plan of what you&rsquo;re going to post and when. The No. 1 error people make when starting a blog is to jump in feet first without fleshing out several months&rsquo; worth of content.</p><p> Inevitably, those who don&rsquo;t have an editorial calendar will find themselves without content at some point and will be forced to scramble to come up with something to post. Those thrown-together posts are the beginning of the end for your blog.</p><p> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u> , we collaborate with our financial services clients to maintain a rolling editorial calendar. We recommend our clients have eight weeks&rsquo; worth of planned topics at any given time, though it&rsquo;s important for the calendar to be fluid so content can address big news internally or externally.</p><p> Want some help planning your editorial calendar? Start by thinking about the economic and financial news that is most relevant to your business.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Check out this handy calendar  </a> </u>  from Bloomberg to see when the next Fed meeting is, when jobs data is released, etc. and plan from there.</p><h3> II. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors&rsquo; visuals</h3><p> <br/> Multimedia and visual content go hand-in-hand with a blog. Those who believe a blog simply generates text are the ones who are constantly scratching their heads about why their traffic plateaus.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://quicksprout.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ultimate-Guide-to-Creating-Visually-Appealing-Content.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to QuickSprout  </a> </u> , content that is accompanied by images gets 94 percent more views than content that lacks a visual.</p><p> However, visuals require a bit of creativity. Simply regurgitating a photo you found on Google Images or stock photos isn&rsquo;t going to do the trick. Invest the time and resources to develop visuals &ndash; including photos, videos and infographics &ndash; in-house.</p><p> This is especially relevant as advisors start to turn their eyes toward millennials (their spending power will be  <u>  <a href=\"http://danschawbel.com/blog/74-of-the-most-interesting-facts-about-the-millennial-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $3.39 trillion in 2018  </a> </u>  &ndash; more than boomers).  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mobilecommercedaily.com/visuals-are-indispensable-for-converting-millennial-shoppers-on-mobile-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Statistics show  </a> </u>  that visual content seriously resonates with this audience and helps engage them.</p><h3> III. Thy bench should be deep</h3><p> <br/> Chances are your practice is composed of experts in a variety of areas &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly how your blog should be structured.</p><p> Take a cue from the way the media divvies up responsibilities and assigns each blogger a beat &ndash; that is, a topic or area of focus. For example, if you&rsquo;re an RIA, your CIO could cover macroeconomic topics and market movements, an on-staff CPA could handle tax topics and a planner could handle posts about personal finance tips and retirement planning.</p><p> The thinking behind this strategy is twofold: First, one person isn&rsquo;t responsible for writing all the content. Second, your blog becomes more interesting and applicable to a wider audience. The different personalities and voices of the authors prevent your content from becoming stale.</p><h3> IV. Honor thy audience</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s no secret that any successful media outlet knows their audience. BuzzFeed, for example, has  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/11/21-things-you-need-to-know-about-buzzfeeds-success\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   figured out the type of content  </a> </u>  that appeals to millennials and teenagers &ndash; and they use it; while baby boomers might find it amusing, it&rsquo;s definitely not written with them in mind.</p><p> When financial services professionals are developing a blog, they can&rsquo;t simply say it&rsquo;s geared toward prospects or current clients. The only way to capture and retain that specific audience is to write for that audience. Who is your ideal client/prospect? Where do they live? What do they enjoy in their free time? Are they married? If you&rsquo;re trying to appeal to businesses and their executives, spend some time brainstorming what their industry demands of them and how your firm can meet their needs.</p><p> Once you narrow down your audience, you can tailor the content appropriately. If you&rsquo;re trying to appeal to pre-retirees in their 50s, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to write a blog post providing financial advice to new college graduates.</p><h3> V. Thou shall share socially</h3><p> <br/> If your business is going to invest the time, money and resources into creating a blog, it&rsquo;s critical to start thinking about how you&rsquo;re going to get it in front of as many eyeballs as possible. Except for a handful of posts that go viral each year, most won&rsquo;t drive steady traffic unless you&rsquo;re actively pushing your content out via  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/tag/social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media  </a> </u> .</p><p> In fact, 80 percent of marketers said  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2014/08/11/the-top-10-benefits-of-social-media-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\">   focusing on social media increased traffic  </a> </u>  to their websites.

Some of the biggest drivers of blog traffic are Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Reddit. Check out this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/4-social-media-mistakes-rias-should-avoid-like-the-plague/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog post  </a> </u>  our team published about the biggest social media mistakes made by advisors.</p><p> If you need some extra motivation to devote time to social media, consider that three in five  <u>  <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/marketing-solutions/global/en_US/site/pdf/wp/linkedin-research-financial-advisors-use-social-media.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   advisors who used LinkedIn to prospect successfully landed a new client  </a> </u> , with a third of those increasing their AUM by $1 million or more as a result of LinkedIn.</p><p> Certainly, starting a blog is no easy task. However, with the right tools in your arsenal, you will find it&rsquo;s a great way to boost your firm&rsquo;s credibility and visibility.

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Why do you need to wreck this company? <br/>  &ndash; Bud Fox</p><p> &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s WRECKABLE, all right? <br/> &ndash; Gordon Gekko</p><p> A common misconception among entrepreneurs (and the public) is that buyers of businesses channel Gordon Gekko on a regular basis, looking to destroy rather than build.</p><h3> Nothing could be further from the truth.  </h3><p> <br/> Buyers can often provide middle market business owners the opportunity to increase their wealth by collaborating on accelerating growth.</p><p> Buyers, whether financial or strategic, value nothing more than a great management team that can continue to operate a business, and with the right partner, see it grow to a more valuable asset than it could have before a transaction.</p><p> This mindset provides an excellent opportunity for business owners who have reached a constraint in their growth and need assistance in growing the business further.  These constraints are common and can come in a variety of forms.  Examples include:</p><li> <strong>  Cash: </strong>  Business growth consumes cash.  Many businesses reach stages in their development where the current ownership group simply can&rsquo;t afford to provide enough capital to grow the company as fast as it wants to grow.</li><li> <strong>  Skills:   </strong> Business owners sometimes need additional skills to grow the company further. The reason for this is that it usually does not take the same set of skills to grow a company from startup to $10 million &ndash; $20 million in revenue as it takes to grow it to higher levels.</li><li> <strong>  Shared Burden:   </strong> Many clients have described to me their desire to sell as &ldquo;I just want to take a vacation.&rdquo;  They want to share the burdens of managing a successful enterprise with someone else.  They love the company and want to continue to grow it, but they just need some help.</li><p> A form of sale commonly known as a recapitalization can provide the vehicle for an owner to remove the constraints, take some chips off the table, yet still have the opportunity to reap the economic rewards of growing the business further.</p><p> In a recapitalization, the seller sells the company and receives a fair value in cash, but reinvests a portion of the sales proceeds in the company, thereby continuing to hold a significant stake in the company (often 20% to 40%).  Usually, the seller stays in control of the day to day operations, but the buyer enables him to remove whatever constraints were holding the company back.</p><p> Typically, these sorts of &ldquo;recaps&rdquo; stay in place for three to five years, and then there is a second transaction.  If the company is able to grow faster than it could have without an initial transaction, the seller can see an overall value for the company that is much higher than if he would have not sold and tried to go it alone!</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m frequently asked to assist advisory firms with finding good &ndash; excuse me &ndash; any operations staff. Hiring and retaining ops staff seems to be a challenge for firms. While I am not in the recruiting business, I can understand some of the issues with finding and keeping good back-office staff, such as the repetitive nature of the tasks and lack of a career path on the operations side of the business.</p><h3> Issue #1 &ndash; Your response to &ldquo;Why should I work for your firm?&rdquo; is not enticing</h3><p> <br/> What are the odds that a candidate is listening to your responses thinking &ldquo;been there, done that&rdquo;?</p><p> Take a close look at the job description. What does your firm have to offer that other advisory firms don&rsquo;t offer? This question is hard to answer because the nature of the job is similar, if not the same, as what the candidate is currently doing. Why would a candidate leave a firm for a lateral move and be doing the same tasks with your firm?</p><h3> Issue #2 &ndash; Your career paths either don&rsquo;t exist or are unrealistic </h3><p> <br/> Many advisors don&rsquo;t understand the career path of the operations side of the business. Some believe it&rsquo;s an administrative thing. As an operations professional, I have been called an &ldquo;admin type&rdquo; by those not understanding that we have college degrees, CPAs, MBAs, and desire a professional career path.  Some advisors believe they can sell the candidate on becoming an advisor or planner without knowing if the candidate is capable of that role.</p><h3> Issue #3 &ndash; Your firm&rsquo;s  human touch doesn&rsquo;t trickle down to the ops staff</h3><p> <br/> You boast how your firm&rsquo;s human touch is why clients love you and will never leave your firm. Can you say the same about your staff?  Somehow, when it comes to the operations side of the business, the thought process switches to how outsourcing and technology can replace the back-office staff. The belief that your CRM and work-flow templates are driving your firm&rsquo;s efficiencies and customer satisfaction, not the people behind them, is an issue.</p><p> Susan Raemer-Rodriguez, President of R &amp; R Human Resources Solutions, understands what employees are looking for. According to Susan, a common complaint her firm hears from employees as they leave firms is, &ldquo;There was no communication from top management. I spent a lot of time wondering about the firm&rsquo;s future or where my career path was headed.&rdquo;</p><h3> Looking for good operations staff? Broaden your horizon</h3><p> <br/> The financial services industry includes other areas such as banking and insurance. The operational areas of these firms parallel RIA firms. Those working in a bank&rsquo;s trust operations or cash management department are familiar with client services, compliance, technology, cash distributions, and financial transactions. Financial services professionals have a good understanding of work-flow processes, CRM, reporting software and are able to apply their knowledge to your processes and technologies. A good training program on your firm&rsquo;s processes will enable new employees to easily learn the way your firm operates.</p><p> Operations staff in other financial services firms might also relish the opportunity to learn another business. They may perceive your offer as a better opportunity. Before working for an RIA firm, my career took me through several areas of the financial services industry including banking, consumer lending, and risk management. I enjoyed the transition to RIA.</p><h3> Want to keep good operations staff? Give them more than CRM training</h3><p> <br/> CRM and tech training are nice, but good operations staff wants to be part of the firm&rsquo;s decision-making process. Provide them with additional skills such as compliance, leadership, or management. They may have greater potential to be effective leaders and business decision-makers than your money managers and planners. You can also enhance your staff job descriptions by adding non-routine work. You can include project management tasks for the firm or allow them to participate in a task force on the firm&rsquo;s future direction. Don&rsquo;t just create a COO path on paper; make the path a reality.</p><p> Now, about your human touch &hellip;&hellip;</p> ",

    "link": "divorcing-women-dont-let-your-husband-land-you-in-tax-trouble",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a divorcing woman, you almost certainly have a number of pressing financial concerns on your mind. Unfortunately, when it&rsquo;s time to file your federal income tax return, it&rsquo;s likely the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   Internal Revenue Service  </a> </u>  will give you even more to consider. Every year brings more nuances and complications to the tax code, and if you&rsquo;re divorcing, you could be facing additional unique challenges, as well.</p><p> Like most married couples, you&rsquo;ve probably been filing joint tax returns, and like too many married women, you may have left that task mostly to your husband to do, or to oversee. But even though that approach was convenient when you were married, now that you&rsquo;re divorcing, your joint tax return could be a potentially dangerous pitfall.</p><p> For example, should it someday come to light that taxes have been underpaid, it won&rsquo;t matter to the IRS whether it was you or your husband responsible for the &ldquo;oversight.&rdquo; If you filed a joint return, the government can come after you both, even if you didn&rsquo;t personally earn one dime of the reported income! What&rsquo;s more, you will still be liable for errors and omissions in joint tax returns even after your divorce is final. That could mean a financial disaster at a time when you&rsquo;re least able to weather one.</p><p> How bad could it get? Well, if your husband has underreported income,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?page_id=471\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   hidden assets  </a> </u> , claimed improper deductions or tax credits, or engaged in other dodgy shenanigans, he&rsquo;s knowingly set you up for a tremendous financial burden. Taxes, interest, and penalties can quickly add up to staggering amounts, and you could find yourself owing the federal (and your state) government many thousands of dollars through no fault of your own.</p><p> So how can you protect yourself against being pursued for tax debt that isn&rsquo;t fairly yours?</p><li> <strong>  File separately. </strong>  If you have even an inkling that your husband is being less than totally honest where taxes are concerned, you should consider filing a separate tax return. Under the provisions for &ldquo;Married Filing Separate&rdquo; (MFS) status, you would be responsible only for taxes on income subject to reporting on your individual return. Using MFS status might mean that in total, you and your husband will pay more in taxes than if you&rsquo;d filed jointly, but believe me, it will be worth it not to be considered responsible for a fraudulent return.</li><li> <strong>  Pursue Innocent Spouse Relief. </strong>  If it&rsquo;s too late to file separately, all is not lost. The IRS does recognize that there are innocent spouses who sign joint income tax returns unaware that anything was amiss, and provides some protection for those innocent spouses. You can formally apply for  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Publication-971\" target=\"_blank\">   Innocent Spouse Relief  </a> </u> , which may absolve you of responsibility for paying tax, interest, and penalties if your husband is found to have made false statements on your joint return. <br/>  </li><p> Obtaining innocent spouse status isn&rsquo;t easy or instantaneous, however. You will have to prove that at the time you signed the joint tax return, you didn&rsquo;t know, and further, that you had no reason to know, that there was an understatement of tax. That can be difficult to establish in all but the most black-and-white circumstances.</p><p> To decide whether you qualify, the IRS will consider your financial situation, your education and business experience, and even whether or not you asked any questions about items on the return when you signed it. The determination might be that you might have known about some of the understated income, but had no reason to know about another portion, and are therefore entitled to partial relief.</p><p> For more information, as well as forms and requirements for applications for Innocent Spouse Relief, visit  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Publication-971\" target=\"_blank\">   the IRS&rsquo;s web page on Tax Information for Innocent Spouses  </a> </u> .</p><p> Filing separately and pursuing Innocent Spouse Relief are two ways to save yourself deep trouble with the IRS if your husband&rsquo;s tax situation is not what it should be. However, I&rsquo;d prefer things never get even that far. My advice is to be proactive. As with so many financial matters, it is always better to be knowledgeable early on. The more you know about your husband&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/01/30/what-a-divorcing-woman-needs-to-know-about-her-husbands-cash-based-business/\" target=\"_blank\">   business  </a> </u> , the less likely you are to sign a joint tax return you can&rsquo;t stand behind.</p><p> <strong>  Reminder: </strong>  Don&rsquo;t fall victim to your husband&rsquo;s tax shenanigans. As a single woman, maintaining your own financial security will be a top priority. If he&rsquo;s been playing fast and loose with the tax returns, and your signature&rsquo;s on them, then that security is at risk.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip: </strong>  If you need to prove to the IRS that you&rsquo;re an innocent spouse, consider engaging a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/09/04/why-a-forensic-accountant-belongs-on-your-divorce-team/\" target=\"_blank\">   forensic accountant  </a> </u>  to help make your case. It will be worth the up-front expense to avoid huge penalties and a tarnished record later.</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters:  </strong> Some women insist that their divorce settlement agreement specifies that if there are tax issues to be rectified down the road, their ex-husbands will be responsible for doing so. On the surface, that sounds reasonable, and you can certainly hope that your ex would abide by such a provision. Understand, however, that the IRS is not bound by your divorce agreement, no matter what it says about taxes. As far as the feds are concerned, if you&rsquo;ve signed the tax return, you&rsquo;re responsible for it&hellip; and if taxes are owed, you can be sure they will come after you, as well as your ex, for payment.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Sitting before me is a couple in their late 50&rsquo;s.</p><p> <strong>  They are in a financial mess. </strong> <strong>  Their work situation is unstable at best and they have amassed no small amount of consumer debt. They are both working part-time&mdash;he in a job he dislikes intensely, she, as a contract worker in a tight industry. To put it bluntly, their situation is dire: too much debt, not enough income. </strong></p><p> Their mood today reflects the state of their finances. In front of &ldquo;Giselle&rdquo; leans a tall stack of papers enumerating each and every aspect of their financial woes. She is looking at all the numbers. He is looking at nothing. His expression? Defeated. </p><p> I start the meeting the way I do each new encounter, by asking: &ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo; My job now is to sit back and listen. What I hear from &ldquo;Ted&rdquo; is a long and self-blaming tale of defeat and how he single-handedly failed his wife and now grown children. He places all the responsibility for their hardship on his own head. If there were a club nearby, he would have bludgeoned himself senseless.</p><p> After a solid ten minutes of this, I interrupt and ask him to pass me a plastic-wrapped biscotti from the canister in the middle of the conference room table. My request baffles him, but he hesitantly complies. I take the biscotti from him, lean forward and use the biscotti to tap him on each shoulder. Looking him in the eyes I say, &ldquo;I absolve you of all your sins.&rdquo;</p><p> Confused, he glances over to his wife and then at me. I smile at them both. &ldquo;Now that you have been absolved, are you ready to change your view from dwelling on the past to thinking about the future and possible solutions?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Finally, they both smile. </strong></p><p> For people with destructive financial habits who are laboring under heavy debt, that weight can become a very real and physical burden (think the chains of Marley&rsquo;s ghost). Having it removed feels like a huge boulder has been lifted from their shoulders.</p><p> &ldquo;Absolved? I am absolved?&rdquo; he asks with a faint trace of hope in his voice.</p><p> &ldquo;Yes, my son, absolved! Now, can we talk about your options and opportunities?&rdquo;</p><p> For the first time since they walked into my office, they audibly exhaled.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing. While it is vital to face up to financial reality, it is not necessary, helpful or healthy to do so while carrying around the guilt and overwhelm associated with that burden. Emotional overload can blind you to the fact that there is always a solution. It can debilitate your ability to find clarity and move to a better place.</p><p> In the case of Giselle and Ted, they were frozen in place by their enduring pattern of self-defeating behavior. In order to get to work, they needed to leave their guilt and self-blame at the door.</p><p> By the end of our meeting, we have mapped out some strategies, isolated some questions that required research and prepared a plan to end the madness.</p><p> Feeling overwhelmed? Try absolving yourself for the past and start taking concrete steps to get out of the muck.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Chances are you&rsquo;ve heard of a Roth IRA, a special kind of retirement account that is funded using after-tax dollars. But have you started one?  Ugh. Retirement planning. Honestly, do we have to talk about that now? Yes we do. There are some uber awesome benefits to opening a Roth IRA that will help jump start your retirement, especially if you are just getting started. Just give me a few minutes, I promise to be quick.</p><p> <strong>  Backstory &ndash; William V. Roth, Jr. </strong></p><p> The Roth individual retirement arrangement (Roth IRA) is less than 20 years old. It was established by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and named after U.S. Senator William Victor &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Roth, Jr. of Delaware, the Harvard educated attorney who sponsored the bill. Senator Roth&rsquo;s political career was marked by over four decades of service, achievement, and advocacy as a relentless champion of tax cuts and wasteful government spending. As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he fiercely promoted the core values of saving for home ownership, education, and self-reliance in retirement through the retirement vehicle that still bears his name.</p><p> Today, the Roth IRA is a cornerstone of many American retirement portfolios. There are income limits and certain restrictions on a Roth we&rsquo;ll talk about later. In the meantime, take a look at the stats. Roth assets in Individual Retirement Accounts in the United States from 2000 to 2013 increased by 547.44% from $78 billion to $505 billion respectively ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/187954/total-assets-of-roth-iras-in-the-us-since-2000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   source  </a> </u> ). Considering the many unique advantages of the Roth RIA helps explain its uber appeal. </p><p> <strong>  Four Uber Awesome Benefits &amp; Guidelines of the Roth IRA  </strong></p><li> <strong>  Age doesn&rsquo;t matter. </strong> Seriously. You can start a Roth IRA whether you are 17 or 71 years of age. The same is not true for a Traditional IRA which places an age limit restriction on individuals a 70 &frac12; years of age and older. If you fall into the latter age category, you can open a Roth IRA but not a traditional IRA. A little confusing, I know. The simple fact that Roth IRA&rsquo;s are age friendly makes it accessible to broader range of investors, both young and old, looking to sock away money for retirement, higher education and even for a first-home or a rainy day. But it&rsquo;s not a slam dunk.  <u>  Related Retirement First and Fantasy Last </u>  As with any retirement investment vehicle, there are certain requirements which must be met. We will include several guidelines that apply to Roth IRAs later in this post.</li><li> <strong>  No penalties and income-tax on early withdrawals, usually. </strong> Have a family emergency or unforeseen expenses like loss of a job? Roth to the rescue! Early withdrawals from a Roth IRA are free from income-tax penalty because the money you deposit into a Roth IRA has already been taxed. So you can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax and penalty free! This may help to provide an investor with peace of mind, knowing there is money readily available in case of an emergency. But watch out, the earnings on that same money follow a different set of tax rules. Unless you are over 59 1/2 and have held the account for a period of five-years, you&rsquo;ll end up paying a 10% penalty and additional income tax on the withdrawals of those investment gains.</li><li> <strong>  Terrific tax &amp; estate planning benefits.  </strong> How does a tax-free retirement sound to you? A Roth IRA will provide it to you. Remember, the contributions in a Roth consist of money that has already been taxed. That&rsquo;s win number one. Now let&rsquo;s look at growth. Earnings will also get to grow tax-free, provided they stay put for a period of at least 5 years. That&rsquo;s win number two. Lastly, parents can leave their Roth IRA to their heirs when they pass on and bypass probate all together. As an estate planning vehicle, the Roth IRA is very effective saving time and money that might otherwise be spent in probate court. That&rsquo;s win number three.</li><li> <strong>  Freedom of choice. </strong>  A Roth IRA provides an investor with an array of investment choices. Unlike a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work with a limited selection of funds, the Roth offers total freedom of choice to choose the types of investments what you want. These may include a mix of individual stocks and bonds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, index funds, REITs, commodities like gold, oil, and coffee, even cash and cash equivalents such a money market fund. Rookie investors can self-manage a Roth IRA and pick the investments on their own, should they choose. The alternative is to use a low-cost automated solution like SheCapital  <u>  <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=5f7af41a-074c-4276-bad1-ab07ab43514b&amp;placement_guid=ca9adaa6-3ed4-449d-babd-bbe80497f209&amp;portal_id=560780&amp;redirect_url=APefjpGYSHGkvhfA8rFua2EI7_7XDnTJttgWO7Hq83oUe9UasFb38AVY9EW-XRLiNuBp1h0vax9ZCeHy9BWrVJjYTha8DVS_wzCKukFCP0Zqc4uC7rMCHg0i7w25HDIU4gnNVocD713rSP1UfsOjEVV4Gx_-pJE1re2BTR0bpV-gSJviNZUhWXAbjJNeWsP-VkQflTo73H7RjHn06MF1hzqRgTWeQjuf2_Zu7JctP9GgUC4JrQuipdU&amp;hsutk=c620a9937a7397f8d5ce6b959e9fcef9&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shecapital.com%2Fblog%2Froth-to-the-rescue-four-uber-awesome-benefits&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shecapital.com%2Fblog%2Froth-to-the-rescue-four-uber-awesome-benefits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Get Started  </a> </u>  to do it for you or hire a financial advisor to help make the investment selections on your behalf. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Before I let you go, it&rsquo;s important to review some general guidelines pertaining to Roth IRAs so you don&rsquo;t get tripped up.  </strong></p><li> <strong>  Consult with your financial advisor or accountant before you open a Roth IRA. </strong> Make sure you&rsquo;re clear on the difference between contributions (what you put in) and earnings (the amount of growth) and the specific rules relating to withdrawals. You don&rsquo;t want to be blindsided by an unintentional penalty or income tax payment.</li><li> <strong>  Yearly contributions limits are different according to age and tax year.  </strong> In 2015, if you&rsquo;re under age 50, you can contribute up to $5,500. For investors age 50 and older, you can contribute up to $6,500. In both cases, it is assumed you have earned income of at least $5,500 and $6,500 respectively.</li><li> <strong>  Not everyone is eligible for a Roth IRA. </strong> There are income limits relating to Roth IRA that change each year. Single filers must make less than $116,000 to contribute to a Roth IRA in tax year 2015. Married filing joint or as a qualifying widow(er), must earn less than $183,000 to contribute up to the maximum limit. Yes, there is a way around it called a back-door Roth you can explore with a financial professional.</li><li> <strong>  There are additional exceptions. </strong> There are some exceptions for taking a distribution from a Roth IRA you should be aware of. For example, if you are a first-time home buyer, receiving disability, or have qualified education expenses. So make sure to share all facts that are relevant to your life with a financial advisor.</li>",

    "link": "8-ways-to-boost-your-websites-performance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p>Website performance matters now more than ever. Research shows the average online shoppers anticipate a 2-second-or-less page loading time (compared to 4 seconds in 2006). After three seconds, 40% of visitors will abandon your site if they don&rsquo;t find the information they need. Worse yet, just a one-second delay in loading time reduces conversions 7%, so for a $100,000/day eCommerce site, that one second costs your company $2.5 million in lost revenues each year. Of course, IT issues like page load time aren&rsquo;t the only reason your website may not be performing to your satisfaction. Fundamental problems with content and overall design are also often to blame. This 8-point checklist will help you diagnose and fix some common issues affecting website performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8 Ways To Boost Your Website&rsquo;s Performance</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Attract more search engine traffic.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What good is having the best website ever if it&rsquo;s not optimized for people to find it through Google and other search engines? Check <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Webmaster Tools </a> for crawl errors which could be making it difficult for people to find various pages on your website. The dashboard will list everything that needs fixing and give you instructions on what to do next. More often than not, this will just require fixing 404 errors with 301 redirects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Find the right audience.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes your site receives a lot of traffic, but it&rsquo;s not the sort of people who want to spend time reading your content or buying from you. A website traffic tracker like <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-track-social-media-traffic-with-google-analytics/\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Analytics </a> or <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics\" target=\"_blank\"> HubSpot </a> can break down the bounce rates of your site and check the data to see which sources of visitors convert the best and the worst. This will help you adjust your strategy on certain platforms. So, for instance, you may want to change the keywords or target a different demographic for your paid advertisements. You&rsquo;ll probably want to conduct a social media marketing audit as well to figure out who is buying from you, which channels they use, what information they need before making a purchase, and what type of content engages the most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Make your website more user-friendly.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An unresponsive website is the kiss of doom for a business these days. Start with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\"> Google&rsquo;s Mobile-Friendly Testing Tool </a> to see if you&rsquo;re getting mostly desktop traffic or a lot of mobile traffic as well, and to assess how easy it is for site users to get to the information they need. There are many affordable tools to get a mobile-friendly version of your site up and running, including: <a href=\"http://www.mobify.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Mobify </a>, <a href=\"http://mofuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Mofuse </a>, <a href=\"http://www.mobisitegalore.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> MobiSiteGalore </a>, Wirenode, and <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/products/content-optimization-system\" target=\"_blank\"> HubSpot COS .</a> If you&rsquo;d rather invest in creating one really responsive website, rather than creating a separate mobile version of your site, you can <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/web-design-before-and-after-makeovers/\" target=\"_blank\"> contact a designer </a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Fix navigation issues.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most websites have a series of easy-to-follow tabs at the top of the page to direct users to areas of interest. While this may seem boring, it&rsquo;s better than losing traffic due to awkward side navigation or overly artistic pages that fail to deliver the information needed to close a sale. <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-analytics-by-google/fnbdnhhicmebfgdgglcdacdapkcihcoh\" target=\"_blank\"> Google&rsquo;s Page Analytics plug-in </a> can reveal how visitors navigate around your site, so you can identify areas with fewer clicks and higher bounce rates.<a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/website-navigation-setup.png\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Write a new landing page.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/7-conversion-rate-truths-will-change-landing-page-optimization-strategy-191083\" target=\"_blank\"> Search Engine Land ,</a> the average landing page conversion rate is 2.35%, but the best websites are converting at 5.31% or higher. Clearly, there is much room for improvement for most website owners. Having a good landing page and A/B testing tool is essential to successful conversions. <a href=\"http://ecommerce-platforms.com/ecommerce-selling-advice/top-10-best-landing-page-creation-and-ab-test-tools\" target=\"_blank\"> EcommercePlatforms</a>&nbsp;lists 10 of the most popular platforms businesses are using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Every landing page should have 2-3 sentences explaining the offer.</li>\r\n\t<li>Instead of just dropping bullet points, consider adding brief testimonials and review excerpts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Invest in decent photography, rather than relying on generic stock photos.</li>\r\n\t<li>Add at least one video to make the offer&rsquo;s values easily digestible.</li>\r\n\t<li>Experiment with a more visual layout, over and beyond the 2/3 content on the left and 1/3 form on the right.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Reassess your blog strategy.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having the right content converts. Have a look at your blog dashboard and request reader feedback using apps like <a href=\"https://teamhively.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Hively </a>, <a href=\"https://www.feedbackify.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Feedbackify </a> or <a href=\"https://qualaroo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Qualaroo </a>. The best blog strategy stems from target market research and an editorial calendar. We&rsquo;ve written about blog strategy in some depth on our sister blog for Mod Girl Marketing, so be sure to check it out at the link below! <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/how-to-build-a-successful-business-blog/\" target=\"_blank\"> You Might Like: &ldquo;How To Build A Successful Business Blog&rdquo; </a><a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/how-to-build-a-successful-business-blog/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Connect content to offers.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Often, businesses worry about providing calls-to-action at the end of their blogs or pages for fear of appearing &ldquo;too promotional.&rdquo; However, every CTA need not be a hard sell. Keep in mind that successful content should intrigue and compel. That audience should be directed to a place where they can contact, buy or click for more information. Your site page analytics should reveal pages with CTAs that are not being clicked on. From there, you can reword the content to better connect the content and the offer. You may find there are offers that lack good CTAs or accompanying content pages altogether, so you may need to create extra pages for your site as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Identify shopping cart issues.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you allow purchases directly from your site, use automated software to identify and fix shopping cart issues. It&rsquo;s been estimated that nearly two-thirds of abandoned shopping cart merchandise is recoverable with a few easy tweaks. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just a matter of delivering the right message at the right time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When I was growing up we lived about 10 miles out town (I was a country mouse) and I rode my bike everywhere.  I thought nothing of pedaling the 7 miles each way to my best friend&rsquo;s house to hang out, when her family moved closer to town.  I did what a kid had to do to get around.</p><p> When I went to college I hauled my bike from Montana to Arizona, zipping around campus and through Tucson&rsquo;s neighborhoods like a message girl on a mission.  I was fearless.</p><p> Somewhere along my vagabond journey, my bike was sold when I went off to do summer theatre, and that was the end of the simple cycling days of my youth.</p><p> Fast forward.  Years.  Lots of them.</p><p> I meet this guy who loves to cycle.  We date.  Get married.  He does all of these long-distance bike rides.  I smile and wave, like a good cheerleader.  You go!</p><p> Six years into our relationship he talks me into buying a bike.  I discover that the old saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like riding a bike&rdquo; is hooey.  Getting back on a bike after all that time was not as easy as I thought it would be.  I rode twice, terrified for my life (and I tend to be a bit of a potty-mouth when I get really scared).  It wasn&rsquo;t pretty.</p><p> Soon after, I found out I was going to be a mom in 8 months and did a little dance inside my head because all the books told me that riding a bike while pregnant wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.  &ldquo;Sorry, Honey!&rdquo;</p><p> Fast forward again.</p><p> Our kiddo is four years old.  Cycling-dad buys one of those fancy trailers that hooks on the back of his bike so the two of them can ride tandem.  He dusts off my bike and pumps the tires.  We&rsquo;re going on our first &ldquo;family-bike-ride&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m petrified but I don&rsquo;t want my son to know.  With a four-year-old in tow I can no longer justify using bad language to cope with my stress, so I&rsquo;m white-knuckling it through the neighborhood.  Like a granny.  I&rsquo;m mortified by myself.</p><p> They gleefully pass me, my son Jeremy with a huge grin on his face, loving every minute of it.  I plaster on a smile and continue along behind them.  Swearing internally.  What happened to me??!</p><p> They&rsquo;re a few paces ahead when my little boy, with his flame-painted-helmet and big green eyes, turns around and earnestly says in his little-boy-voice, &ldquo;Believe in yourself!  Believe in yourself, mommy!&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s a moment frozen in time.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve since been on hundreds of family-bike-rides and I now remember what I loved so much about riding &ldquo;back in the day&rdquo;.  The feeling of freedom!  Celebrating the outdoors!  Being together and having fun!  It&rsquo;s awesome.  But getting back to experiencing the awesomeness of bike riding took something.  I had to push through my own road blocks to get to the good stuff.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve tapped into that memory more times than I can count.  When I&rsquo;m feeling unsure.  When I&rsquo;m holding myself back.  When I need to overcome my own self-doubt.  I hear that sweet little voice in my head, &ldquo;Believe in yourself, mommy!&rdquo;</p><p> Nelson Mandela spoke of courage as not being an absence of fear, but rather the triumph over fear.  And what I&rsquo;ve come to learn, after having the privilege of working with thousands of leaders whilst working on myself, is that we&rsquo;re all far more capable and resilient than we know.  We just need a little voice to bridge our courage when we&rsquo;re not feeling it.</p><p> <strong>  We&rsquo;re all far more capable than we know.  We just need someone to bridge our courage when we&rsquo;re not feeling it. </strong></p><p> As a leader, you can be that bridge for others &ndash; making it possible for them to move through their fears and into their courage.  Because it&rsquo;s there, our bravery.  Sometimes we just need a reminder.</p> <h3>  </h3>",

    "content": "<p> Ever wondered how education could be changed from a boring classroom scene into a more lively experience that will engage and empower the human brain? Technology is the key that opens doors beyond your wildest imagination. Literally. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that can truly transform learning methods. What started out as something that was &ldquo;cool&rdquo; has become a way to engage studious people and to address learning disabilities. Because it can overlay digital content and information onto the real world, it opens up a new range of learning opportunities. As the brain responds much more engaging to visuals, AR will enable a more intuitive way to learn. Therefore it should get a more prominent role in educational programmes.</p><h3> How augmented reality contributes to education</h3><p> <br/> Augmented reality brings learning to life. Augmented reality enriches a live view of a real-life environment &ndash; the so called reality &ndash; with computer-generated input, that can consist out of sound, graphics, text, video, and GPS information. In other words, AR provides us with an enhanced view of the real world.</p><p> When you are depending on traditional education, and you have difficulties processing a lot of information through reading books and listening to lectures, learning becomes quite an ordeal. This could all change when we would approach the human nature of learning: watch and interact with our environment and learn from it. Using this approach through technology could help people to absorb more knowledge and enable them to get a degree. Let me illustrate this. Imagine looking at the walls in your living room and the paintings on your walls and the pictures on your casing come to live and suddenly become interactive. Through this technology the pictures will tell your story to others in a very appealing way. Your audience would hang upon your lips, so to say, and probably remember your story in time.</p><p> As Gaia Dempsey, Managing Director of DAQRI International,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.technavio.com/blog/augmented-reality-is-changing-the-way-we-work-learn-and-tell-stories\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   explains  </a> </u> , &ldquo;80% of the information that the brain takes is visual. So by providing information in a visual medium that also has the spatial nature of augmented reality, you&rsquo;re giving the brain a very intuitive way of accessing knowledge.&rdquo; Augmented reality is therefore very suitable to enhance learning facilities and help students with learning disabilities. So why hasn&rsquo;t this been integrated in most schools?</p><h3> Myth: augmented reality is unreachable for schools</h3><p> <br/> Augmented Reality (AR) allows educators to unlock or create layers of digital information on top of the physical world. Do you think that would be unattainable for schools? Not at all! A lot of people think augmented reality is only accessible via expensive smart devices, like  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Glass  </a> </u>  or Head-mounted displays (HMDs) as  <u>  <a href=\"http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/06/microsoft-hololens-dev-kit-arriving-in-q1-2016-for-3000-windows10devices/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Microsoft HoloLens  </a> </u> , but AR is easier than you think. As Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus VR,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/oculus-vr-founder-classrooms-are-broken\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   was saying  </a> </u>  at the Web Summit: &ldquo;Augmented reality and virtual reality are going to converge in the same sorts of hardware that you wear and carry around with you all the time, so there&rsquo;s no reason to think it can&rsquo;t supplant everything we already do with smartphones, and lead to other applications.&rdquo;</p><p> AR can be used as a learning technique whereby the environment adapts to the learner. By providing clarification on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while discovering and learning. AR could even reduce cost for learning institutes. Take anatomy classes for instance. Technologies like AR (and VR) could be appealing to medical schools, because it&rsquo;s cheaper and more accessible than having a cadaver lab. This technology can bring students closer to scientific discovery than real-world solutions. Or how about social studies? Augmenting a town hall and having students be in the shoes of a voter, a civil servant or a mayor for a while; that could be a great way to experience practice.</p><p> The beauty of augmented reality is that the learning experiences can be as easy or as complex as you want.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-02-how-to-transform-your-classroom-with-augmented-reality\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   This article  </a> </u>  shows AR in action and it describes some nice examples of apps. There are numerous already-made apps connected to various content, but creating a custom application would not be farfetched. Curious on how augmented reality could be integrated in the classroom? Here&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2013/06/20-ways-to-use-augmented-reality-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   20 examples  </a> </u>  on how augmented reality could be used in education. But before learning institutes dive into the tooling, they should first think about the right educational strategy when it comes to using technology in classrooms or at online learning platforms. A tool is just a tool, it won&rsquo;t replace knowledge, but it helps to obtain it. After all, knowledge is something we gather, what we do with that knowledge falls under wisdom. In other words, let&rsquo;s be wise and choose this technology for the right reason and with the most effective approach. Than we can make it a consistent and valuable resource for the way we educate.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The best intentions can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. While the State of Connecticut has been relatively aggressive in funding its pension for the past 14 years, it still has a $27 billion unfunded pension liability. Its funding ratios are near the bottom of the state pension rankings. At 42% for its State Employee Retirement System (SERS) and 59% for its Teachers&rsquo; Retirement System (TRS), funding levels surpass only last place Illinois.</p><p> Connecticut is one of the wealthiest states in the Union, but its pension funding levels are so low that the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College (CRR) was asked to perform an analysis of the state&rsquo;s retirement systems to determine the factors that contributed to the problem. The CRR identified four factors that have contributed to the state&rsquo;s low funding levels:</p><li> <strong>  Legacy Costs &ndash; </strong> Prior to 1971, the state did not set aside assets to pay for future benefits. Those legacy costs now represent $9.3B of the unfunded liability.</li><li> <strong>  Inadequate Pension Contributions &ndash; </strong> The state&rsquo;s average pension contribution since 2001 has only been 90% of its annual required pension contribution (ARC). While it did issue $2 billion of pension obligation bonds in 2008, the 10% deficit in the ARC has resulted in $4.7 billion of the unfunded liability.</li><li> <strong>  Assumed Rates of Return Too High &ndash; </strong> Connecticut pension plans returned about 5.6% annually between 2000 and 2008 versus an average 8.25% assumed rate of return. The incorrect return assumption resulted in $8.9 billion of the unfunded pension liability.</li><li> <strong>  Inaccurate Actuarial Experience &ndash; </strong> Finally, actuarial experience can be significantly different than reality. Early retirement incentive programs or incorrect assumptions about how long retirees live greatly impacts pension results and currently accounts for $4.1 billion of the unfunded liability. <br/>  </li><p> Our readers are well aware that pension liabilities are of major focus for us as we analyze the financial condition of municipalities. Some states, like Connecticut, we avoid entirely because of these issues.  CT is selling $650mm of general obligation bonds this morning, but we&rsquo;ll be on the sidelines as the yields on the bonds don&rsquo;t adequately compensate investors for the long-term risks presented by these types of issues.  </p>Source: The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, SNWAM Research",

    "link": "5-factors-financial-advisors-should-consider-for-growth-in-2016-and-beyond",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As 2015 comes to end, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn some important lessons this year about what it takes for advisors to have a leading edge and how to guide exceptional teams.</p><p> Some of the lessons are new, based on research our firm has conducted and actions taken by the advisors we work with. Other lessons come from trends facing the industry: compensation models, technology, and intergenerational wealth transfers to name a few.</p><p> Each of the lessons serve as a roadmap as we head into 2016.</p><p> In the next few weeks set aside some time to think about your business and answer, &ldquo;Where are you today?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;What needs to happen to fill the gap between the two?&rdquo; Then, make a commitment to chart your course of intentional action that includes at least some of the following five topics that focus on the future success of your firm.</p><h3> 1) Appoint and Support a Chief Compliance Officer</h3><p> <br/> Most of us dread the word compliance. It&rsquo;s challenging, it&rsquo;s boring, and it&rsquo;s something most of us simply don&rsquo;t like. Like it or not, compliance is an area you need to focus on in the coming year. The stakes are getting higher and rules are more complex. Ensure your compliance officer is prepared, properly empowered as a senior officer, and has a strong knowledge of your firm&rsquo;s business model, relevant risks, and is located on-site.</p><p> A Chief Compliance Officer in your firm plays a crucial role in fostering integrity in the securities industry. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, ensuring the firm complies with the rules that apply to operations. CCOs should work with senior leadership to instill a culture of compliance, nurture an environment where employees understand the value of honesty and integrity, and encourage everyone to take compliance issues seriously.</p><p> If you utilize a third party for compliance, read the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/ocie/announcement/ocie-2015-risk-alert-cco-outsourcing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   latest report from the SEC  </a> </u>  regarding outsourced compliance professionals.</p><h3> 2) Utilize Technology</h3><p> <br/> Top advisors view new technology as an opportunity rather than a disruption. Many advisors believe that only the younger generation is interested in new technology; this is a big misconception. The digital transformation taking place is an opportunity for you to improve the client experience and utilize new software to enhance client reports.</p><p> Client expectations have changed as consumers utilize online resources as a first step to find products and services; financial advice is no exception. Clients and prospects of all ages want digital access to their accounts and their advisor. They also want an up-to-date, interactive website. If you haven&rsquo;t made it easy for clients to access their accounts and communicate with you online, you are falling behind.</p><h3> 3) Differentiate Your Firm</h3><p> <br/> A question that continues to come up time and time again is, &ldquo;How do I differentiate my firm?&rdquo; A recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pershing.com/our-thinking/thought-leadership/what-do-top-advisors-say-and-what-do-investors-really-think\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pershing Study  </a> </u>  cites 60 percent of investors found it hard to distinguish among advisors because most said the same things and made the same promises.</p><p> One of the best ways to set yourself apart is to create a client centric advisory practice. Build the client experience so there is no question that your clients&rsquo; needs come ahead of your own. Not only will your clients know exactly what to expect, they will be confident in providing referrals to your firm. Establishing a client centric culture and trusted brand will differentiate your firm far more than your fees or products.</p><h3> 4) Create Strategic Alliances</h3><p> <br/> Business growth doesn&rsquo;t come from wishful thinking. As you know, it takes a lot of hard work. Coordinating the right mix of strategies to gain market share and improve client acquisition rates is essential to advance your firm in today&rsquo;s economy.</p><p> Uniting with attorneys, insurance agents, CPAs, and other professionals is one of the best investments you can make for your firm. While cost and skill sharing are notable reasons to form an alliance, an association with suitable partners will extend the depth of your team and provide a means to offer clients a full spectrum of services.</p><p> Pay attention and anticipate the evolving needs of your clients. During client meetings restate the services you offer, communicate value, and express the meaningful role you play in their lives. Our team created a step-by- step workbook to help you create successful alliances. Be sure to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   download the workbook here  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 5) Build a Team Infrastructure</h3><p> <br/> Teaming is no longer an option, it is a necessity. As your firm becomes larger, everything becomes more complex and it becomes very difficult to grow. Advisors typically find themselves working in the business rather than on the business. Get out of the weeds by hiring ahead of growth. Determine what you are good at. If you are good at looking at the big picture and financial planning, but not so good at implementing details, mentally free yourself by delegating and ensuring you have the right human capital on your team.</p><p> A successful team is a group of financial advisory professionals who rely on the team rather than an individual to serve and manage client relationships together as one unit by combining skills, time, and expertise. A team</p><p> model leads to a more collaborative environment. Clients like knowing that, besides the business owner/advisor, there are other professionals working on their behalf. Build your infrastructure so you can grow into it.</p><p> <strong>  In Conclusion </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s imperative to operate your business at scale by allocating and optimizing resources to achieve the best results. Make it a priority to get to scale so you don&rsquo;t have to play catch up and then try to compete.</p><p> &ldquo;Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you&rsquo;re climbing it.&rdquo;  -Andy Rooney</p>",

    "content": "<p> Earlier this year I wrote about  <u>  open banking </u> , the opportunities it brings to financial services, and my belief that the competition and innovation enabled by new regulation in this area will drive a revolution in customer experience and a new emotional connection to banking.</p><p> Since then, the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) has received parliamentary support and has been passed to the European Union for official endorsement. PSD2 sets out to standardise, integrate and improve the efficiency of payments within the EU &ndash; offering consumers better protection and service through innovation and cost savings. The directive facilitates competition in the payments market, which will mean more options and better value for consumers.</p><p> The directive requires banks to share their customers&rsquo; data with anyone that holds the required licence. I cannot emphasise enough that this is a big deal. Opening up this data brings new opportunities to existing players, and lower barriers to entry will enable new suppliers to enter the banking and payments scene. Likely candidates are applications that aggregate multiple accounts, facilitate comparisons between products, allow you to switch accounts at the touch of a button, or apps that make payments and &ldquo;do your banking&rdquo; without going near your bank. Anne Boden&rsquo;s Starling Bank summed these changes up well (and with humour) in its blog  <u>  <a href=\"http://starlingbank.co.uk/explaining-psd2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Explaining PSD2 without TLAs is tough  </a> </u>  &ndash; I recommend you take a look.</p><h3> Countdown to better customer experience</h3><p> <br/> PSD2 has received a lot less mainstream attention than it deserves. This is the single most revolutionary change that has happened in recent times in the banking industry, and the result will be an unprecedented change to customer experience. Now is not a time to bury heads in the sand &ndash; traditional banks need to consider their position and response. When the EU gives its approval (and it will), banks will have just two years to comply. Many banks will suddenly find themselves bogged down in the task of meeting compliance by making their legacy systems compatible &ndash; but this is just the distraction that could mean they miss the larger point.</p><h3> What does PSD2 mean for banks? </h3><p> <br/> There are two ways traditional banks could react:</p><li> Take a step back from the customer and allow their infrastructures to facilitate transactions, while consumer brands (such as Apple, PayPal or new players) engage with customers directly. </li><li> Use their scale and brand to adopt open innovation approaches and create enhanced, customer-focused packages to sit alongside standard services. These additional services would become revenue streams that fund further innovation and commercial growth.</li><p> Which approach is best? It depends on what kind of business you&rsquo;re running, but here are some considerations. </p><li> Is your brand trusted to look after people&rsquo;s money and identities? Is it also trusted to provide the best products and experience?</li><li> Are your customers emotionally connected with you?</li><li> How do you differentiate yourself? If your answer is &ldquo;service&rdquo;, can you articulate exactly what this means and is it genuinely perceived by customers?</li><li> How strong is your organisation at building compelling experiences in a digital world, relative to the class-leaders? </li><li> What part, if any, do your products and services play in distinguishing your brand?</li><li> Is customer-led innovation a core competence and pervasive in the culture of the organisation?</li><li> Does your business have the scale, resilience and operating model to process transactions reliably, quickly and at low cost?</li><li> Do you partner with smaller, newer companies to offer alternative products that complement your own (e.g. alternative funding services)?</li><li> Is your B2B team clear on the impact of PSD2 and already negotiating the necessary commercial partnerships to leverage a new position opening up</li><li> Are tools and systems (not just IT) encouraging agile and empowered decisions?</li><li> How are you managing your relationship with the regulator today, and how do you plan to invest in this relationship in a post-PSD2 world? <br/>  </li><h3> Learning from our peers</h3><p> <br/> PSD2 echoes the &ldquo;Local Loop Unbundling&rdquo; regulation change in the telecoms industry back in 2000, when the communications watchdog forced BT to open its exchanges to competitors for the first time. At first the effect was negligible, with a few competitors springing up, but none that posed a real threat. Over time, though, the regulation change had a massive impact, as a more competitive broadband telecommunications market emerged and organisations had to fight harder to attract and retain customers. Quality increased and prices decreased. BT faced previously unknown challenges, and after some difficult years it eventually came back with a compelling service offering. It now faces a new challenge in light of Ofcom&rsquo;s plans to force it to open up its fibre-optic network in April 2017.</p><p> PSD2 could bring similar disruption for the banking sector. Without a clear strategy now, banks are going to be hit hard by competitors who already have the user experience nailed. Only those with a clear vision of who they will be in this new landscape, and a strategy to get them there, stand a chance of holding their ground while the industry finds its new plateau. It is a time of shifting perceptions, monumental changes and experimentation. For some banks, this is where Heads of Innovation are now proving their value &ndash; slowly but steadily influencing the cultural and leadership changes needed in a post-PSD2 world while creating the new partnerships and platforms for innovation to grow and thrive.</p><h3> Customers set to win out</h3><p> <br/> The potential customer benefit from the regulation is what makes this story so compelling. If Midata opened the doors to more competitive banking, then PSD2 has taken down the walls and removed the roof. PSD2 will offer customers a greater choice of services, together with a means of comparison to understand their options and make the best choices. </p><p> Midata promised customers the opportunity to compare accounts, and the 10-day switch guarantee made it easier for customers to move to a new bank. But it didn&rsquo;t happen. It is still too complicated to uncover meaningful differences between providers and accounts. PSD2, however, promises much greater innovation, adding a level of transparency in payment and account services, which will mean that banks have to differentiate themselves and compete in a very different market and with a very different strategy. In this new landscape, the customer will have more power and drive bigger change &ndash; forcing banks to deliver customer-centred innovation and more personalised services. How the services will look remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: customers will win from the changes driven by this regulation.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When you&rsquo;re selling your expertise, rocking your point of view &mdash; in words, compelling images and with feeling&mdash; matters.</p><p> It gives your potential clients and buyers a prism&mdash;a gateway&mdash;to differentiate you from the dozens, hundreds or tens of thousands (thank you Google) of other choices they could make. To connect with you. To believe in you.</p><p> And so you must answer their pivotal question: why should I listen to you?</p><p> But not in chest-beating &ldquo;I am so wonderful&rdquo; advertising-speak. You want to show them how you see the world in which you work your magic.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/your-manifesto/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A sharply-worded manifesto  </a> </u>  can capture your point of view and serve as a clarion call to your perfect-fit audience.</p><p> Not quite ready for an in-your-face manifesto? You can still rock your point of view and use it as a come-hither for your sweet spot clients and buyers.</p><p> Start by jotting down what you believe to be true about your work. Here are a few questions to get your juices flowing:</p><p> <strong>  Who do I really want to work with? </strong>  Hint: this is an area where you can not only narrow your niche, but you can use language to draw in the client who rings your chimes. Do you need a client who appreciates a steady hand at the wheel or do you serve those who want outrageously creative solutions? You&rsquo;d use very different voices to attract those two buyers.</p><p> <strong>  What are some of the core tenets of my work? </strong>  Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re an HR consultant&mdash;what do you believe about the role of talent in organizations? Or the role of the leaders with whom you consult? How should people in organizations be treated? Get clear on your belief set that underlies every assignment.</p><p> <strong>  What outcomes am I striving for? </strong>  It&rsquo;s OK to think lofty&mdash;how will you get there if it&rsquo;s not on your radar? If you&rsquo;re a financial advisor, your goal may be to help clients live the life they&rsquo;ve always imagined. Look at the work you&rsquo;ve done&mdash;your best success stories&mdash;and look for the commonalities in the end result.</p><p> <strong>  How have I structured my work to deliver those outcomes? </strong>  Let&rsquo;s be clear&mdash;this isn&rsquo;t about smoke and mirrors, but real, tangible aspects of how your service delivery is designed to mesh with your promise. Drill down to exactly the aspects that form your/your firm&rsquo;s DNA. A financial advisor who wants to help clients reach their dreams should not be opening a conversation asking about their investment mix.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve filled a few pages with your thoughts on this&mdash;preferably in two or three sittings&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have the core of your point of view. You can hone it and polish it to use on your website and sprinkle in your social media and marketing collateral.</p><p> Or, you can simply use it to inform your marketing. As the underpinning of the success stories you cite, the language you use and the real-world and digital pipelines you build.</p><p> In either case, it&rsquo;s a great exercise in clarity. What do you believe?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Why is Marketing best suited to manage corporate social media activities? </strong> <br/> At the core social media activities are a function of Marketing, just as PR, Communications and Customer Service should be. Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large. IMHO, the CMO should oversee all marketing, PR, communications, customer service, and customer experience management. Every touch point with the consumer needs to come under her purview. Often this is not the case&mdash;customer service and communications/pr are often siloed. This is a big mistake in the new marketing/social world since the message needs to emanate from one source. True marketers understand that they must be the lead stewards for brand, reputation, communication, and customer relationships.</p><h3> Are some tasks better suited to Marketing versus PR or another department entirely?</h3><p> <br/> Now that I have explained my thinking with regard to Marketing being the overall steward, we can move to what should be said by whom, and whether it lives in one place,or throughout the organization. I believe a social mindset needs to be part of the culture and DNA of an organization so that every team can operate as needed day-to-day, and all employees will be empowered to support the brand and allow always ongoing communication to happen. When social media operates from a separate group or from a separate location, or only one silo, there is a greater probability of poor integration with all other efforts that happen simultaneously every day. What needs to happen is that social media thinking and practice should be closely linked to the brand and customer teams so they are involved as soon as communication objectives have been established and daily needs surface.</p><h3> How can teams collaborate to execute successful corporate social media programs?</h3><p> <br/> By having an integrated overall Marketing strategy that includes Social side-by-side with, and a part of, PR/Comms, Customer Service and Customer Experience, the company&rsquo;s management and execution of its customer and brand assets becomes seamless. All strategic elements come together and reflect a clear and consistent understanding of the value the company offers to its customers, community, employees and partners.</p><p> Social media platforms, via the engagement culture you empower, are the only place where a company can engage with their customers, vendors, employees and the community, in a day-to-day personal and business perspective, in real-time. This concept and culture will serve as the crucial link that unites a company&rsquo;s marketing strategy with the ultimate goal&hellip; trust, loyalty and sales.</p><p> This originally appeared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u> .</p>",

Do you find yourself reluctant to believe in its effectiveness?  Do you see goal setting as a time waster?</p><p> It took me a while to get a real handle on goal setting and went through several phases.  <strong>  During phase one, </strong> I didn&rsquo;t even bother setting goals outside of work.  In my career, setting goals was part of the culture of several of my employers, but it became more of a work thing.  Then, because I have always been an avid reader, I was educated into believing in the effectiveness of goal setting.  I read several books from several different authors all promoting how important it was to define what you want in life and then set it to paper.  I figured if all these successful people swear by it, I should attempt to do it myself.</p><p> <strong>  During Phase Two, </strong> I became great at writing down several of my goals.  The problem was that once I wrote them down, I would tuck the paper away and refer to it only when I would come across the paper.  It was never an intentional follow-up on what was written.  I eventually came to realize that this wasn&rsquo;t getting me the results that I was looking for.</p><p> <strong>  Then came Phase Three. </strong>   I began not only to write down my goals, but read and re-read them on a consistent basis.  I found myself determining action steps based on what I deemed was a priority.  I noticed that the clearer I was on what I wanted, the better my results.  I happily starting checking off my goals one by one and created more.  I was achieving what I had first set out to accomplish in the beginning.</p><h3> What changed?</h3><p> <br/> When I spoke to other people, I found we all faced similar roadblocks.  What were some of these common denominators?</p><h3> Here Are 9 Reasons You May Not Be Achieving Your Goals: <br/>  </h3><li> Lack of belief that it will make a difference</li><li> You are unclear of where you should start</li><li> You are in your comfort zone and don&rsquo;t see the benefit of stepping out of your comfort zone</li><li> You are happy already, &ldquo;why would you work hard for more and risk failure.&rdquo;</li><li> You feel that you don&rsquo;t have the time required to put in the effort</li><li> You secretly don&rsquo;t believe you deserve it (more common than you might think)</li><li> You feel you don&rsquo;t have the required skills necessary to achieve your goals</li><li> You tried goal setting in the past, only to get discouraged for lack of immediate results</li><li> You don&rsquo;t have a great support system to motivate you during those tough moments <br/>  </li><p> I think the biggest and most important change was not in the processes but my mindset.  I decided that I would commit myself to setting goals despite the obstacles I was facing.  I realized that most, if not all the obstacles were self-inflicted.</p><p> &ldquo;Change your thinking and you&rsquo;ll change your world.&rdquo; &ndash;Norman Peale</p><p> Your state of mind determines a lot of your successes even before you start. It works with or against everything you do.  Your motivation behind your goals will also go a long way in determining its effectiveness.  If you set a goal that you are not passionate about, that doesn&rsquo;t drive you, then you risk not following through with the actions necessary to achieve it.</p><p> Taking accountability for every result you achieve will gain you power.  Forget about the mistakes from the past.  Look ahead of you and plan forward.  Surround yourself with mentors that will support you and guide you through the frustrations.  Share your goals only with people who will help give you a push up when you face a steep wall.  Don&rsquo;t get discouraged with those people who try to knock you down.  You are in control of your own life and emotions.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Among the complexities of later life are added health-care costs and challenges, planning for living arrangements should long-term illness require it and being assured that your legacy and estate is passed on properly to your heirs. For those who should be relaxing and enjoying their retirement years, stress is often caused because retirees have neglected to not only lay out a plan for their later years that consists of estate issues, living and health arrangements, but they've failed to discuss their intentions with their family.</p><h3> Estate planning, living wills and health-care proxies are all topics that retirees are being told they need to address.</h3>To address them properly requires a discussion between retirees and their families. I call it \"<u> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Having-Talk-Four-Parents-Retirement/dp/0985082038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443817925&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=having+the+talk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the Talk\" between adult children and their parents </a></u> about these later-life issues. All families seem to have it at some point, but the reality is that most times, it's done too late.It seems that everyone has a story about having \"The Talk\" too late. The family who wanted to correct a parent's estate plan but recognized that \"look back\" provisions on a trust negated any plans to salvage a rapidly depleting estate. The brother or sister who had expectations of what they would inherit and were significantly disappointed when their dying father revealed his actual plans for those assets. Family wealth and sadly, even relationships between families, suffer because these discussions are done \"too late.\"<p> So when should you have \" <u>  the Talk </u> \"?</p>I've long been a proponent of having the talk when parents are nearing the point of retirement and they've spent significant time and effort designing what their plans will be. It is often a time of introspection and clear thinking, and this makes it an appropriate time to have that all important family discussion.Fidelity conducted an \"<u> <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/static/dcle/welcome/documents/intra-family-generational-finance-study.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Intra-Family Generational Finance Study </a></u>,\" which agrees with me that this is the right time to have this discussion. \"Parents are more likely to cite when they near or enter retirement as the right time.\"Yet, it was a recent discussion with America's leading financial adviser, <u> <a href=\"https://advisors.edelmanfinancialengines.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ric Edelman </a></u>, that has led me to recognize that the timing of The Talk should probably happen well before that.\"Parents need to discuss money with their kids starting as early as age three,\" Edelman says. \"After all, the child is already helping to make financial decisions at that time, such as which cereal to buy.\"Edelman advocates that young children should be made aware of money and how it's earned and used at an early age. He even believes that as children grow up, it's beneficial to include them in the process of putting together your tax return. He feels that this will help them to recognize the impact of money and the need to plan around it.\"You ask six-year-olds where does money come from, and they'll tell you the ATM,\" Edelman points out. \"Talking to your children early prepares them for college planning and for their own retirement planning as well.\"It's hard to argue with the man who has been named Barron's Top Independent Financial Adviser in the nation three times, and Edelman makes the point clearly that educating children at an early age and opening up the channels of communication between families about money will set the stage for proper planning throughout the generations.No matter what age you feel is best, it's clear that having \"The Talk\" earlier rather than later is the best solution.",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Susan Marshall</p><p> We all know that, without a doubt, customers demands are increasing. They expect you to meet them where they are, help them in the decision-making process, make their buying/checkout process easier, and they expect you to keep up with others leading the way across the industry. For most businesses, it&rsquo;s not feasible to lead the way of innovation, especially when you don&rsquo;t have the team or budget to support it. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t ignore your customers&rsquo; wishes. If you choose to not innovate and not meet your customers where they are, then you may be forfeiting their business without even realizing it. </p><p> <strong>  What Do Your Customers Want? </strong> <br/> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/239272\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Entrepreneur  </a> </u>  Magazine, planning a digital marketing strategy is essential to getting ahead of the competition. So do you know if your customers are happy, sad? Indifferent? You need to know. The ability of a business to thrive in today&rsquo;s economy is based on how well that organization is able to adapt to digital media. That&rsquo;s the fastest path to understanding if what your customer wants. From social networks to smartphones to tablets, the digital tools available today make it possible for consumers to interact on a global scale. As a result, regardless of your business&rsquo;s industry or size, it is imperative that you learn how to leverage the ability of consumers to interact and engage. (via @Entrepreneur)</p><p> Developing a successful digital marketing strategy is as simple as:</p><li> Identifying your target audience.</li><li> Developing your business goals.</li><li> Designing and implementing a strategy for meeting those goals.</li><li> Monitoring your chosen strategy. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Be Committed to a Seamless Experience </strong> <br/> Whether or not you have the ability to completely revolutionize the customer experience top to bottom or not (and very few companies do), there are certainly elements that every business should consider. Take a look at the below  <u>  suggestions from Direct Marketing News </u>  and consider how your company can make improvements today (via @DMNews): </p><li> Rethink every element of your media mix as having one purpose: serve and satisfy the customer</li><li> Create processes for generating ongoing &ldquo;Voice of Customer&rdquo; feedback from social media channels and sales and service representatives</li><li> Synchronize and integrate your multichannel mix with precision and value</li><li> Rethink incoming calls, emails, and social media interactions as high-value marketing and branding opportunities</li><li> Focus on customer lifecycle marketing; i.e. nurturing long-term relationships <br/>  </li><p> How do you know if customers are happy? What if they are mad, sad or indifferent? Its important to understand. Connecting with the customer means everything in today&rsquo;s world. Start with an evaluation of your existing marketing efforts, and new and improved digital marketing actions will help you drive sales, reduce costs and find better ways to compete, whether your business is online or on the ground.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Financial planner Diahann Lassus views as misguided the &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; some baby boomers have with paying off their mortgage before they retire.</p><p> But Jane Rose, who has done just that with the loan on her home in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, has discovered how liberating it is. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a happy camper,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> The math versus the emotion, the rational versus the irrational, head versus heart &ndash; that&rsquo;s a simple way of framing a complex issue. Many boomers looking ahead to their retirement years are grappling with whether to pay off their mortgage before they retire or shovel any spare funds into their employer&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/401-k-catch-up-help-for-the-few/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   401(k)  </a> </u> . Both arguments have merit for very different reasons.</p><p> First, the math.   The alternative to paying off the mortgage &ndash; extra funds for the 401(k) &ndash; will provide more savings, more net wealth (assets minus debt), and more financial flexibility in retirement, according to many financial planners and an economist here at the Center for Retirement Research (CRR).</p><p> &ldquo;There are few problems in life that aren&rsquo;t mitigated by having a lot of money,&rdquo; says Anthony Webb, CRR senior economist.</p><p> Indeed, directing  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/401-k-catch-up-help-for-the-few/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   extra contributions  </a> </u>  to a 401(k) is particularly attractive to well-heeled boomers in high tax brackets, who benefit the most from having both tax breaks: the federal mortgage interest deduction and the 401(k) tax deferral for contributions.</p><p> Other considerations, however, can tilt the balance toward paying more on the mortgage.</p><p> The mortgage interest deduction isn&rsquo;t as valuable as it was when mortgage rates were higher and generated a larger deduction. Tax rates also generally decline in retirement, when incomes are lower. Those who expect to have low or zero tax rates in retirement will get little or no tax advantage from holding on to a mortgage and keeping their savings in a 401(k).</p><p> Investing a larger 401(k) balance in the stock market, with its high expected return, is also risky &ndash; and pursing this strategy hinges on being able to bear that risk. Rose, who paid off her mortgage, warns against &ldquo;assuming the 401(k) will just make money. They can lose money.&rdquo;</p><p> Then there&rsquo;s the emotion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rarely about the numbers only,&rdquo; said Rose, who is retired and vice president emerita at RTD Financial Advisers.</p><p> She was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable she felt being mortgage-free. &ldquo;I have no car payments. I use credit cards and pay them off. I have no debt. No other payments.&rdquo;</p><p> Perhaps the emotional downside of paying off the mortgage is having less saved for those unexpected expenses like medical bills. Lassus urges that those who are driven to pay it off should consider that &ldquo;their money is just getting stuck&rdquo; in an illiquid asset &ndash; the house. If it needs a new roof, where will they find the money to fix it? Having more savings provides financial flexibility, including the ability to eliminate the mortgage later.</p><p> So here lies the dilemma: the comfort of having reserves but a mortgage vs the comfort of owning a house, free and clear, but having less savings.</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the most overused words in the English language is also one of the shortest. In the context of Customer Experience, it is extremely likely that this word is regularly used when an unsatisfactory experience is &lsquo;endured&rsquo; by a customer. The word NO contains only two letters, yet its meaning can have serious ramifications on the behaviour of your employees and as importantly your customers.</p><p> It is doubtful that you have ever taken the time to read the dictionary definition of a word that you are extremely likely to understand rather well! In case you are interested, the official definition of the most common use of the two letter word is as follows:</p><p> &ldquo;A negative used to express dissent, denial, or refusal, as in response to a question or request.&rdquo;</p><p> Sounds a little harsh, doesn&rsquo;t it? As a parent, I must admit that I fall foul of using the word far too often. &lsquo;Can I watch TV Dad?&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rsquo;NO&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;.&rsquo;why not?&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rsquo;because I said so!&rsquo; This, or a variation of it may seem familiar to many &ndash; it certainly is to me. We use the word NO without even thinking about it. In a way, it is an expression of control&hellip;..of power.</p><p> When a customer contacts a company to ask for help, hearing the words, &lsquo;I am so sorry, but NO, we cannot help you with that&rsquo;&hellip;.leaves the recipient of the words, the customer, feeling no different to the child being told that they cannot watch TV. &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t you do that?, the customer may ask&hellip;.&rsquo;it is not company policy (because we said so!)&rsquo;, may be the response.</p><p> I dream of many things when it comes to the world of Customer Experience. Filling the world full of Customer Experience Professionals is one! Another of my dreams is to &lsquo;ban&rsquo; the unnecessary use of the word NO. Maybe banning a word is not particularly reasonable, or feasible, but perhaps &lsquo;re-defining&rsquo; it is. So just what do I mean?</p><p> What if your business were to mandate that all employees were only allowed to use the word &lsquo;NO&rsquo; as a positive rather than a negative? Instead of:</p><p> <strong>  NO CAN DO! </strong></p><p> Why not replace it with:</p><p> <strong>  NO PROBLEM! </strong></p><p> Instead of:</p><p> <strong>  NO WE CAN NOT HELP YOU! </strong></p><p> Try using:</p><p> <strong>  NO WORRIES! LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN DO! </strong></p><p> See &ndash; it&rsquo;s not really that difficult. In fact, asking your people to change the use of a word is very easy &ndash; the difficult bit is for your organisation to being authentic about the new definition. The reason why the word NO is overused by businesses is because they are not prepared to genuinely put the customer at the heart of everything they do &ndash; the definition of Customer Centricity.</p><p> If you are genuinely Customer Centric, you will do whatever it takes to help your customer &ndash; you will not say NO. One of the world&rsquo;s most customer centric organisations, Ritz Carlton Hotels, excel at this. All employees understand their relationship with customers &ndash; their &lsquo;North Star&rsquo; &ndash; &lsquo;Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen&rsquo;. What a lovely expression. All Ritz Carlton employees also understand the customer principles that guide this relationship:</p><li> Old fashioned values</li><li> Out of my way service</li><li> Anticipation and unexpressed wishes</li><li> Our way and proud (&lsquo;my pleasure&rsquo;) <br/>  </li><p> The word NO does not feature. They do not ever say NO &ndash; they say &lsquo;my pleasure&rsquo; instead. It is not hard, if you trust your own ladies and gentlemen to serve other ladies and gentlemen.</p>",

    "content": "<p> They say &ldquo;An old dog who refuses to learn new tricks shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to raise puppies.&rdquo;</p><p> I don&rsquo;t remember who first said it, but it makes sense.</p><p> Yes, there are always going to be new things to learn.</p><p> There are always going to be new challenges to growth as you continue to build your practice.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t get back lost time, yet the one constant that you can depend on&hellip;</p><p> The one eternal asset you have is your perspective, or better said&hellip;</p><p> Your EXPERTISE!</p><p> What you&rsquo;ve been through, seen, life lessons learned and experienced first hand&hellip;</p><h3> This is one of your most powerful, if not THE most powerful asset you have as an advisor.</h3><p> <br/> So, the good news (whether you consider yourself an old dog or not) is that you if you focus and are willing to roll up your sleeves a little&hellip;</p><p> You can leverage your expertise to help you generate better leads so you can grow your practice.</p><p> You&rsquo;re going to love this article if you&rsquo;re serious about using what you already have to get more of what you want.</p><p> In a recent coaching article, we suggested you ask yourself the question&hellip;</p><p> &ldquo;Is your pipeline stocked with worthwhile prospects?&rdquo;</p><p> As a first step in answering this question, we recommended a simple strategy for cleaning up and leveraging your current prospect database.</p><p> Yet a logical next question becomes&hellip;&rdquo;What if I don&rsquo;t have a good sized prospect database to leverage?&rdquo;</p><p> If this is the case, we recommend lead generation. But not just any type of lead generation.</p><p> We recommend that you get specific about using your expertise to begin generating leads.</p><p> Expertise based lead generation, when organized properly and run consistently, is a low-cost technique for quickly building a database of qualified prospects.</p><p> What&rsquo;s more, these prospects are looking for professionals with YOUR specific know-how.</p><p> You simply offer a demonstration of your knowledge, a magnet, and let your niche market(s) know you are accepting new clients. Done correctly, this helps create desire and  begins to set the stage for follow-up calls or appointments and ultimately puts you in a position to close the business.</p><p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be before you can do, and you&rsquo;ve got to do before you can have.&rdquo; &ndash; Zig Ziglar</p><p> Lead generation, as we will describe it, is NOT a direct mail campaign.  In fact, you don&rsquo;t even need to use the mail.  And when you choose to send mail, your response rate should be significantly higher than the typical letter or postcard.</p><p> You are not doing &lsquo;me too&rsquo; promotion by trying to sell the same product or service as your competitors.  When you position yourself as an expert by offering something of value (your magnet), qualified prospects will raise their hands and let you know they are willing to spend time with you.</p><p> Below is a screenshot of the cumulative lead growth we&rsquo;re experiencing from introducing just one new lead magnet of our own in August.</p><p> (There&rsquo;s a good chance that you&rsquo;re here now reading this article because you took us up on that offer.)</p><p> So let&rsquo;s dive into the 5 Steps that will help you build or improve your own expertise based lead generation campaign(s).</p><p> <a href=\"http://encorepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-11.17.54-PM.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-11-09 at 11.17.54 PM\" src=\"http://encorepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-11.17.54-PM.png\"/> </a></p><h3> 5 steps that will lead to a successful expertise based lead generation campaign&hellip;</h3><h3> <br/> 1.  Determine your niche market</h3><p> <br/> Regular readers of these articles know we constantly stress the importance of beginning all marketing campaigns with a niche market.  Expertise based lead generation is no exception.</p><p> In truth, you should probably stop reading right here if you are not willing to spend some time clarifying a target audience for your lead generation campaign.</p><p> To help with this process, consider the simple example of a successful campaign we helped construct for a financial advisor who was focusing on capturing large IRA rollovers.</p><p> When we viewed the make-up of his current rollover clients, we determined he had the most success with senior executives who were retiring from major corporations in his community.  All of his efforts as we built his campaign centered on this niche, not the more general &lsquo;pre-retiree&rsquo; market he initially identified.</p><p> &ldquo;Your magnet should be a valuable resource that positions you as an expert with qualified prospects.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2.  Create your magnet</h3><p> <br/> Your magnet should be a valuable resource that positions you as an expert with qualified prospects.  It tells prospective clients you are open for new business and encourages them to let you know when they are ready to begin a dialogue.</p><p> You are giving away information&hellip;a real solution, but not a complete solution.  A well-designed magnet must also pass the &lsquo;best client quality test&rsquo;; it is something you would be willing to send even your most important current clients.</p><p> More specifically, a magnet is an article, case study, white paper, interview or presentation you have created to both demonstrate your knowledge and cause your reader or viewer to ask questions.  Articles and white papers can be published or unpublished.</p><p> Interviews may be written or recorded as audio or video.  Presentations could be printed slides and notes from your latest seminar, a video recording of the same presentation or a PowerPoint with audio you record on your PC.</p><p> Though this may sound complicated, there are creative and simple ways for even non-writers to develop articles and white papers.  Consider the &lsquo;David Letterman Technique&rsquo; in which you create a &lsquo;Top 10&rsquo; list of do&rsquo;s or dont&rsquo;s for your target market.</p><p> In the case of the advisor we mentioned above who built an IRA rollover campaign focused on retiring executives, we designed an FAQ style (Frequently Asked Questions) paper with &rsquo;20 Key Questions&rsquo;.</p><p> We merely listed 20 questions this advisor regularly receives from his top clients along with answers that would compel the reader to seek additional help.</p><p> &ldquo;You are &lsquo;selling&rsquo; the magnet, not you, your firm or a product or service.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3.  Offer your magnet to your niche market</h3><p> <br/> As mentioned earlier, offering your magnet does not necessarily mean sending mail.  Creativity in this step can serve the dual purpose of keeping costs down and increasing results.</p><p> In addition to a letter or a postcard, you can place ads in trade publications or use email where permission-based lists are available. You could position it front and center on your website  Or look for opportunities to place banner ads.  And don&rsquo;t forget social media.  Think of the easiest ways to get in front of your niche market.  Where do they hang out?</p><p> We worked with an advisor who lives in a small, upscale town that has a gourmet grocery store frequented by the town&rsquo;s wealthiest citizens.  And though to some this may sound &lsquo;tacky&rsquo;, she has a small poster near the coffee bar with tear off coupons.  Right next to ads for &ldquo;free kittens&rdquo;, &ldquo;babysitter needed&rdquo; and &ldquo;carpet cleaning&rdquo;.</p><p> Her magnet is an audio interview on wealth management she recorded with a local news personality.  Though the leads come in slowly, each week she is surprised by the number of people who request both a copy of the interview and appointments.</p><p> For your offer of a magnet to be effective, you must use an attention catching style that encourages the recipient of the message to request the free resource you are making available.  We coach advisors to use &lsquo;headlines&rsquo; and stress 2 or 3 benefits of reading, viewing or listening to the magnet.</p><p> You are &lsquo;selling&rsquo; the magnet, not you, your firm or a product or service &ndash; that will come later.  Your message should reflect both the importance of what you do as well as the personality and professionalism of your practice.</p><h3> 4.  Deliver your magnet with a next step</h3><p> <br/> When you send your magnet in the mail or email, be sure to mention a next step.  Perhaps it will be a follow-up call to answer additional questions, send further information, invite to a seminar or schedule an appointment.</p><p> Remember, you are stressing your practice is open for new business and you are willing to meet with qualified people in your niche market who have an interest in your area of expertise.</p><p> &ldquo;Expertise based lead generation is a powerful tool for building a prospect pipeline full of qualified future clients.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5.  Follow-up on your leads</h3><p> <br/> The last and easiest step should be to follow-up on your leads.  And though this may sound obvious, we know many advisors &lsquo;forget&rsquo; to call their leads on a timely basiswhich nullifies all prior efforts.</p><p> Either you or a member of your team should follow-up within 5 business days of sending your magnet.  Again, this could be anything from a phone call to answer questions to an invitation to a seminar on the same topic to an email offering a second opinion on a financial plan or investment portfolio.</p><p> Expertise based lead generation is a powerful tool for building a prospect pipeline full of qualified future clients.  If your prospect database isn&rsquo;t where you think it should be, take some time to build a simple campaign.</p><p> When you do this with consistency, you will find it much easier to keep your calendar full of appointments and your business will grow.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As I reflect on 2015, I can&rsquo;t help but think of how many friends I know who&rsquo;ve made serious career moves this year.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve watched many friends leave crappy jobs and go to new ones &hellip; And, while this is worth celebrating, it isn&rsquo;t really a surprise. I expect people who work in bad environments to make a change.</p><p> What has been a shock is watching the friends who weren&rsquo;t in crappy jobs make the same changes. Senior Executives and Top Level Talent at companies that seemed to have it all and who seemed to love their jobs &mdash; yet they quit! They took a position at someplace new. They started a business of their own. They created a new path for themselves.</p><p> As I deal with the challenges of the day-to-day in my own job, I wonder sometimes if I should do the same. I wonder if it is time for a change. I wonder if I should chuck the deuces and try another path &hellip; And if you are like me, this time of year has you thinking about where you are, where you want to go and the best way to get there.</p><p> As I talk to my friends about the big changes they&rsquo;ve made, I noticed some common themes in their feedback. Here&rsquo;s a few clues that it&rsquo;s time to make that job change:</p><p> <strong>  Your supervisor doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;get it&rdquo; </strong>  &hellip; Whether it is the need for more personnel, better hiring practices, competitive compensation, improved technology, if your supervisor cannot see the needs or support your suggestions for improvement and advancement, it is time to make a change. People quit their bosses far more often than they quit the company or the work.  <strong>  Top talent is no different in this regard. </strong></p><p> <strong>  There is a consistent lack of development support </strong>  &hellip; Similar to a supervisor that gets it, you also need support for growth and learning. If you&rsquo;re having to get special permission or use personal time to attend development events, it is time to make a change. People want to feel supported and encouraged in their efforts to increase their skills, knowledge and value.  <strong>  Top talent is no different in this regard. </strong></p><p> <strong>  You see opportunity all around you </strong>  &hellip; Major career moves are not about leaving one place as much as it is stepping into a new place, whether it is creating your own business or working in someone else&rsquo;s. When all you see is opportunities around you to add value and have impact and fill a need beyond where you are, it is time to make a change. People leave for a challenge that is obviously different and greater, not just for financial increase.  <strong>  Top talent is different in this regard. </strong></p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s not about more money </strong>  &hellip; Major career moves are not about earning a greater salary as much as it is doing a greater work. The self-talk isn&rsquo;t about &ldquo;not getting paid enough to put up with this mess&rdquo; or &ldquo;earning thousands more if&rdquo; you worked somewhere else when you are making a major career move. When you don&rsquo;t care about the money anymore, it is time to make a change. People leave because the passion and possibility pulls them in a new direction.  <strong>  Top talent is different in this regard. </strong></p><p> For me, the jury is still out on this.</p><p> What I do know is that I am glad to be writing and podcasting with the team at PIC. So I&rsquo;m looking forward to great things for this group and myself in 2016. Because I know there is more fulfilling work to be done here. And sometimes you have to just bloom where you are planted.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A leader&rsquo;s own professional development often takes a back seat to the immediate needs of their organization and team. Yet to end up at the best possible version of yourself, or &ldquo;future you,&rdquo; a deliberate, doable commitment to learning and development is needed.</p><p> It starts with clarity about where you are heading and why. In a noisy, work-swamped world, a simple &ldquo;mantra&rdquo; serves as a GPS to help stay true to the best future you, one that you are either steering toward, or away from, every day.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s in a mantra?</h3><p> <br/> For example, imagine a three-word mantra like: &ldquo;Inspiration, Delegation, and Organization.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s say that reminds a leader to continue: 1) inspiring their team, because it&rsquo;s a needed change and a fulfilling role for them, 2) delegating more non-value-added work to enable them to maximize revenue and economics (both P&amp;L, and their own earnings), and 3) hiring/structuring their organization to be more self-sufficient so they can take their best next professional step. While this is simply an example to help you know what it looks like, here&rsquo;s how to develop your own &ldquo;future you&rdquo; mantra.</p><h3> How to develop it?</h3><p> <br/> As they say, &ldquo;Begin with the end in mind.&rdquo; To do that, I&rsquo;d like you to imagine the best of your professional self one-year from now. Let&rsquo;s say you and I sit down to check in on your progress toward your professional goals a year from today, and you&rsquo;re feeling absolutely delighted with where you are. For that to be true, let&rsquo;s say you stand at the intersection of three main roads, each needing a &ldquo;mantra word.&rdquo;</p><p> 1. Doing what has purpose and heart for you: by one year from now you are working on purpose &ndash; that is, doing what fires you up so that you are happy and doing your best work most days. You are spending minimal time doing what gets you down, stresses you out, or runs afoul of your values. Whether you are making the world a better place, helping your team be their best, or simply putting food on your table, your day-to-day work life satisfies and fulfills you because it&rsquo;s in sync with your sense of purpose. What&rsquo;s needed for this to be true, that&rsquo;s different than it is today? Develop one &ldquo;mantra word&rdquo; that will remind you day by day of that needed change to be more in sync with what has purpose and heart for you.</p><p> 2. Making your economics work: by one year from today you are earning what you desire, and are able to organize your financial life accordingly &ndash; both in terms of business results, and your own earnings. You are feeling good about where you are financially, and not unduly concerned, worried or having doubts about money. What&rsquo;s needed for this to be true, that&rsquo;s different than it is today? Develop a second &ldquo;mantra word&rdquo; that will lead and remind you of the needed change to be on track toward the economics you want.</p><p> 3. Developing your capabilities: by one year from now you are in a situation that&rsquo;s allowing you either to grow new capabilities, or consolidating your understanding of existing capabilities. Regardless, you are neither stagnant nor coasting in terms of growing / developing yourself professionally. What&rsquo;s needed for this to be true, that&rsquo;s different than it is today? Develop a final &ldquo;mantra word&rdquo; that will lead and remind you of the needed change to develop your capabilities as the professional you most want to be.</p><p> Put your three words together &ndash; they don&rsquo;t need to rhyme (as above), as long as the mantra is easily memorable to you. It can be ABC, 123, or something that makes sense to you. And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be carved in stone &ndash; in fact it&rsquo;s best if it evolves with what&rsquo;s happening and changing in your world at work, so going through this process annually is a healthy way to keep it fresh and relevant.</p><h3> How to use it effectively</h3><p> <br/> Aside from building and evolving it annually, your mantra also needs to be used in a great way. Given the day-to-day demands of leadership, how do we do that?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s call where you are today &ldquo;Point A&rdquo; and the one-year hence intersection of purpose, economics, and capabilities (with delight) &ldquo;Point B.&rdquo;</p><p> Day to day, week to week, check in with yourself: are you moving on a straight line from A to B? What needs to change for you to correct your course, and move more directly from A to B? What do you need to start doing, stop doing, or make sure you continue doing, to make a &ldquo;B-Line&rdquo; to Point B?</p><p> Ask yourself which (if any) barriers stand in the way from A to B, and what you can do to manage / remove them.</p><p> Finally, enlist the help you need to remain accountable to your outcomes in these three areas. Do you need a friend or colleague with whom to share your one-year vision, and check in from time to time during the year?</p><h3> So what?</h3><p> <br/> I know the idea of having a &ldquo;future you&rdquo; mantra is a bit unconventional. That said, it&rsquo;s an innovative and individualized way to make sure you attain the goals most important to you, and to lead in the most effective way. I invite you to give it a try ...</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Imagine your client has had a stroke, unable to speak. Or she falls and is unconscious for a time. Her adult kids know nothing about her financial situation because your client refuses to talk about it when them. You asked her about her relationship with her adult children, in looking at her finances and legal paperwork for the future. You&rsquo;ve encouraged her to discuss these matters with family.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Just mind your own business. I&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; she tells you.</p><p> Her adult children are concerned and ask reasonable questions. One of them called you. Her son says she clams up, changes the subject and otherwise puts off having a conversation about finances when the kids raise it.</p><p> <strong>  What is your client afraid of? </strong></p><p> Seniors are often afraid of losing their independence and control over their lives if they reveal their financial situation to their adult children.</p><p> They are afraid of being put in a home. Their thinking seems to be that if they can avoid talking about it, they can avoid the things they fear.</p><p> Some fear that if they tell their kids what&rsquo;s in the bank and the parents have a lot of assets, that their kids will lose motivation to work. Some parents are afraid their kids will pressure them to give the kids money and it will be unpleasant or confrontational. Others are afraid that the kids will try to get control over the money.</p><p> <strong>  They need reassurance. </strong></p><p> One way to approach this and address a client&rsquo;s fears about this kind of conversation is to have a family meeting, which you, the professional facilitate.</p><p> It can help to openly acknowledge the senior&rsquo;s fears. For example, you can coach your client&rsquo;s adult child to say something like this:</p><p> &ldquo;Dad, maybe you think I want to know about your finances because I have some hidden motive of trying to take advantage of you.  I assure you, I don&rsquo;t. I just want to be able to help you if you get sick. You&rsquo;re (85, or whatever). You won&rsquo;t live forever and I may be burdened with trying to help you when I know nothing about what to do. Please let&rsquo;s talk about this.&rdquo;</p><p> Most reasonable aging parents will accept that they don&rsquo;t want to unnecessarily burden their children. This pitch can work. We also acknowledge that some parents just don&rsquo;t care if they are a burden and that this may not be successful for everyone. However, it is certainly worth a try and we urge you to make the effort.</p><p> Your aging client and her family will all be best served if the subject of finances is dealt with openly. A concerned professional in the aging person&rsquo;s life can lead the way to better knowledge about finances for the family.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how to close a sale, but then lost out to a competitor, you&rsquo;ve pondered this question. &ldquo;What did they have (that I didn&rsquo;t)&rdquo; ?</h3><p> <br/> As it turns out, it&rsquo;s not so much about what they have, but about what they do. Specifically, what sales winners do differently is this: they bring a radically different approach to the entire sales process. From start to finish.</p><p> Let me walk you through the 2 most important factors sales winners do differently &ndash; and introduce a third one, which if you use it will put the entire process on steroids.</p><h3> #1 &ndash; &ldquo;Educated me with new ideas and perspectives&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The #1 factor buyers say sales winners do differently that helps them close a sale is bringing (truly) new ideas and perspectives to the table. Note the parentheses around truly: it&rsquo;s not just about echoing commonly held &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; or bringing up a point of view from the latest HBR-research. It&rsquo;s about bringing an exciting, fresh perspective to the table that was previously unknown or unconsidered by the buyer.</p><p> In my experience, the higher up you sell, the more this becomes a crucial point of distinction. Senior executives and the C-suite in particular are constantly searching for innovative perspectives that can give them an edge in the marketplace.</p><p> Stuck on how to close a sale  by educating with new ideas and perspectives ? Consider the following questions as a guideline:</p><li> How you can redefine the problem in ways your buyer never even considered ?</li><li> Which angles or issues can you bring up that they probably overlooked ?</li><li> How can you &ldquo;go against the grain&rdquo; and counter popular wisdom ?</li><li> How can you solve an existing problem in new and more efficient ways ?</li><li> How can you package your offering so it truly stands out from competitors ?</li><li> How to help your buyer see their intended solution will not solve their problem ? <br/>  </li><p> The last question especially is crucial, because it addresses several of the factors buyers reported sales winners do differently. </p><h3> #2 &ndash; &ldquo;Collaborated with me.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Stop thinking only about how to close a sale. True sales winners think more like high-end management consultants than salespeople. Rather than &ldquo;find the pain&rdquo;, they work on defining the problem (or opportunity) so it becomes crystal clear &ndash; and then work with the buyer to find the most effective and efficient way of solving it.</p><p> Senior executives and buyers are not looking for yet another vendor to come in and promise them the heavens &ndash; only to underdeliver. They are looking for smart, experienced and accessible counterparts who will collaborate with them &ndash; challenging their thinking where needed &ndash; in developing the best solution for their particular needs.</p><p> So next time you&rsquo;re in the meeting room, think whiteboard. Not Powerpoint.</p><h3> Remember that #3 factor I hinted at ?</h3><p> <br/> The one that would put the entire process on steroids ?</p><p> Here it is: combine &ldquo;educating your buyer with new ideas and perspectives&rdquo; with &ldquo;collaborating with them&rdquo;. Senior executive buyers are always looking for people that are willing and able to help them think through the myriad existing problems they face in new and exciting ways, and working together on developing solutions to the table they could have never come up with by themselves (or, for that matter, using internal resources).</p><p> Do that enough and for long enough, and you&rsquo;ll gain that most coveted status.</p><p> Trusted advisor.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> 3 Questions that Matter Most</h3><p> <br/> Every financial advisor or wealth manager has a background on file with Securities Regulators. It&rsquo;s easy, and it&rsquo;s free to check out an advisor&rsquo;s history.</p><p> Just go ahead and do it!</p><p> If your advisor is a licensed broker, go to  <u>  <a href=\"http://brokercheck.finra.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   brokercheck.finra.org  </a> </u>  and simply type in the advisor&rsquo;s name or the name of his/her firm. Maybe he or she is registered with  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/investor/brokers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">  SEC </a>  as an independent investment advisor. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether an investment advisor works for a brokerage firm, no problem! Head to sec.gov/investor/brokers.htm. If you do not find an advisor&rsquo;s name listed with regulators ask why not&ndash; this could be a big red flag.</p><p> Once you decide to starting working with a professional investment advisor, here are the 3 questions you really need to ask:</p><h3> 1. What&rsquo;s your expertise?</h3><p> Advisors specialize in everything from college planning to estate planning. You really want to make sure what you need is what you get in terms of expertise.</p><h3> 2. What kind of interaction do you expect with this advisor?</h3><p> It is key to set realistic expectations. If you want to be part of every decision or thought process, or you prefer to simply opt out and let your advisor make all the decisions, it&rsquo;s essential you communicate those expectations right from the start.</p><h3> 3. How am I paying you?</h3><p> You&rsquo;re the client &mdash; and you are paying for professional advice and guidance whether it&rsquo;s a commission every time you buy or sell an investment or a straightforward fee. You need to clearly understand how and how much you&rsquo;re paying. My suggestion is to ask your advisor to show you on an actual statement where you see every fee and any charges.</p><p> Remember, I&rsquo;m working on a brand new web tool that will be available next year called, Financial Advisor Connection where we&rsquo;ll help you find the best-fit advisor by matching your preferences to the right expertise.</p>",

    "content": "<p> With the presidential election still a year away, we&rsquo;re already waist deep in press coverage. Election 2016 promises &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo; as the players rally for position. <strong>  For many, the biggest surprise to date is real estate mogul and business dynamo Donald Trump&rsquo;s meteoric rise to become the Republican Party&rsquo;s frontrunner. </strong></p><p> Putting political preferences and personal opinions of The Donald aside, financial professionals can find much to learn by examining his communication techniques &ndash; the good, the bad and the ugly. </p><h3> Revel in the Spotlight:</h3><p> Dubbed a &ldquo;perpetual attention machine,&rdquo; Trump excels at being the center of attention, garnering 50-60% of all press coverage in the GOP field this summer according to Nate Silver for Data Lab of fivethirtyeight.com.</p><p> Financial people generally prefer a nose to the grindstone approach, liking numbers and analysis, keeping heads down and focusing on the job at hand. Instead, like Trump, capitalize on opportunities to address your clients and prospects. Be in the right place at the right time in front of the right people. Make yourself the face of your brand, and then deliver a consistent story that makes your services and products memorable.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Be a Talking Head:</h3><p> Adept at disrupting nearly every conversation, Trump is willing to talk about anything from bashing the Mexican people to rating supermodels.</p><p> But how do these issues relate to &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo;? Even if you are in the right forum, sharing your opinions on every economic, political and other issue in the news is more likely to confuse your audience than endear you to them. You may sound smart, but instead, you can hit more homeruns &ndash; and avoid conflicts &ndash; by sticking to a clear, concise message to capsulize who you are and what you do.</p><p> There&rsquo;s often only a few minutes to make an impression, whether on a TV spot, planned presentation or more casual business lunch. Think about what your clients and prospects need to know about how you are different and better for them than your competitors are and focus your comments to support those points.</p><h3> Develop a niche: </h3><p> When you think of Donald Trump, is it his hotels, wineries, golf courses, TV show, line of menswear at Macy&rsquo;s or political aspirations that come to mind?</p><p> Trump has diversified his brand. That&rsquo;s good for him, but makes it difficult for the average person to know what he&rsquo;s really all about. Even though he&rsquo;s been successful in many areas, Trump probably isn&rsquo;t the first person you&rsquo;d look to for fashion ideas or&mdash;for that matter&mdash;balanced foreign policy advice.</p><p> A financial professional needs a specific persona: If you&rsquo;re a killer on the golf course, that&rsquo;s great! Nevertheless, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t invest too much time giving interviews to Golf Digest about your golf swing if you&rsquo;d like to build your financial cleintele. Instead, focus on delivering the messages that your primary audience is interested in: your record of accomplishment of consistent investment success.</p><h3> Draw Attention to Yourself:</h3><p> It&rsquo;s hard to turn away when Trump is on TV. He&rsquo;s passionate, animated, exudes energy and vision. He may even let someone pull his hair as he did on national TV at the beginning of a campaign speech on Aug 27.</p><p> An engaging persona is one of the reasons Trump is interviewed so often. Emulating that kind of charisma is hard, but being authentic and passionate about your business shouldn&rsquo;t be. Positive attention means more people know who you are, what you do and what you stand for. Take advantage of that to build your business.</p><h3> Believe in Your Message &ndash; but Don&rsquo;t be a Bully:</h3><p> Trump refuses to back down. He apologizes to no one, including the head of Fox News.</p><p> Having conviction in your own beliefs and processes can go a long way to engender confidence. These are troubling economic times and people need professionals they can count on for advice and counsel.</p><p> However, being a bully about it does more harm than good, and once Google finds you, you are hard-pressed to bury bad news. Trump&rsquo;s feud with FOX reporter Megyn Kelly should serve as a warning to anyone who speaks to the media: be respectful of journalists and other influencers, as well as your competition. </p><h3> Own your Successes:</h3><p> Trump does a great job referring to poll numbers and accolades; he&rsquo;s let us know he&rsquo;s dominated the GOP race from June to August so far.</p><p> Financial firms often neglect to nominate themselves for &ldquo;top lists.&rdquo; Some financial firms who do win these industry awards fail to fully leverage them with client announcements, press releases, web postings or in-office displays. Third party recognition can go a long way in adding credibility for your firm; don&rsquo;t let false modesty hold you back. People like to jump on the bandwagon of winners.</p><h3> Promote Yourself:  </h3><p> Trump loves to say his own name &ndash; in fact 131 times (twice as many times as any other contender) during the Aug 6 Republican Debate, according to mrctv.com.</p><p> Trump wants you to remember him and know he&rsquo;s the best, pointing to his own wealth as undeniable proof of his success. Perhaps 131 times is a bit excessive, but you should be willing to talk about your successes and differentiate yourself from the competition. If you manage money or give advice on how to succeed, your clients will want to know you&rsquo;ve followed that same advice, investing in the same strategies and successfully building your own wealth as a result. </p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Have a Volatile Strategy:  </h3><p> Despite Trump&rsquo;s conviction, he&rsquo;s been caught more than once with a message that&rsquo;s distinctly different from what he was pedaling a few weeks previously. Sometimes, it even changes question to question.</p><p> Sophisticated investors want to know that their advisors have disciplined, repeatable processes that produce consistent results. Unlike Trump, you&rsquo;re not likely to reverse your story, but have you surveyed how several individuals in your firm tell it? Does everyone talk about your process in the same way, pointing to the same key points? Or might a listener think you&rsquo;re from different firms?</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Alienate Your Team: </h3><p> Trump tends to say exactly what he thinks, when and wherever he may be.</p><p> Because of this habit, Trump&rsquo;s political advisor Roger Stone exited when Trump spent more time getting involved in public feuds than staying on message. While it is a good thing to speak your mind, remember that you&rsquo;ve hired good people with specialized skills to do a job. If you have marketing and sales professionals on staff, rely on them and take their advice. Encourage open communication and honest debate before finalizing any plans. Trust and collaboration are key to building a successful team.</p><h3> Be a Thought Leader: </h3><p> If anyone has the ear of the media and the business world, it&rsquo;s Trump, driving ratings and click rates, says the Huffington Post. </p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s his net worth, maybe it&rsquo;s his business acumen, maybe it&rsquo;s both, but people always want to know his thoughts on the day&rsquo;s topics.</p><p> Developing media relationships takes time, but it&rsquo;s an investment worth making to establish your reputation as an industry expert. Writing articles or getting on the speaking circuit not only broadens your audience, it puts you on the radar and can lead to valuable partnership opportunities within your industry.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Discount Social Media:</h3><p> Facebook reported that 3.4 million people shared information about Trump 6.4 million times in the 24 hours after he tossed his hat in the ring, top among all contenders &ndash; and in the first hour, he garnered 87% of all US Google search inquiries, according to the New York Post. And Trump is a pro at creating news for himself on Twitter.</p><p> Clearly there are regulatory hurdles in the financial industry that make using social media outlets challenging, but it is not impossible. Our world and how we communicate is changing. While the giants in the industry can assign staffs of writers and reviewers to the task, smaller firms and individuals owe it to themselves and their constituents to look closely at today&rsquo;s landscape and consider a game plan to engage this new media.</p><p> There is no doubt that Donald Trump is a case study in extremes &ndash; both positive and negative. He&rsquo;s built a brand centered on his persona, something individual financial professionals or firms can emulate. Perhaps the biggest positive take-away is simply to &ldquo;get out there&rdquo; and be seen and heard.</p><p> On the flip side, unlike Trump, before you take the stage, hone a clear message about your brand. Being able to articulate your approach to financial success in simple language and explain why it is a better mousetrap will speak volumes to potential clients. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Simply turn on the television, radio, or surf the internet and you will quickly find many reasons to feel scared, angry, sad, or hopeless.  The information age is as the name implies. And we are on information overload from the moment we awaken, to the time we go to sleep; if we are even able to sleep!</p><p> The media outlets, though, would not barrage us with information, if in fact there was no demand for it. As basic economics teaches, in order for money to flow toward the provider, there must be demand. The fact is, most of us crave the insanity we see in the world. We crave the disaster stories. We crave the murder-suicides. We crave the drama. As horrible as events may be, they are good for ratings and CNN knows this best.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s take a peek into our brains to begin to understand this. I see humankind as a duality&mdash;a primitive nature controlled by what I call the automatic brain or AB and a Divine nature accessed via our higher mind. In order to begin tapping into the latter, one must dissect out the sanity in an insane world. Yet the AB stands in the way. This brain has evolved over more than 250 thousand years. It has only one purpose: to help us detect danger, threat, or vulnerability. The way this happens is by storing information and referencing current events or circumstances against the stored data. When an event represents danger, this brain causes us to react by fight or flight. Though the data may differ among us, the reaction is, for the most part, universal.</p><p> The AB stores the data in three main folders&mdash;the one-up folder, the unknown/unfamiliar folder, and the loss of love (essential security) folder. It is always on the lookout for events in our life where someone may appear more superior to us (one-up), circumstances that may seem unfamiliar, or the threat of losing the love (security) of someone.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the framework. When tragedy strikes someone else or somewhere else, our brain processes this as making us feel one-up, superior, hence safer. But it also has us seeking out such information so to store data as to what may be in store for us in the form of danger. In addition, our AB has us seeking out the drama when it comes to the fall of someone successful. Such stories draw much attention. The media knows this, without fully understanding the AB, but simply can see the ratings.</p><p> The irony is that as hard as this brain works to protect us, it actually puts us in a much more vulnerable place. It causes us to feel all those negative feelings I listed in the opening sentence. It has us seeking out so much information that we essentially become numb to it. And by blocking access to our mind, thus Divine nature, it strips us from our true power. Although the concept of a Divine nature may sound fluffy to some and even insane to others, I propose that letting the AB drive us is the primary reason for the world&rsquo;s insanity, and not just because of the media, but because of the masses constantly fighting and fleeing.</p><p> To stay sane in an insane world, means living more in concert with our higher mind in control. Here are some ways to do that:</p><h3> Avoid the news</h3><p> For the reasons stated above, this is key. I suggest picking very carefully, which articles and stories to which you listen or read. Resist the curiosity to learn how many people were killed from a tornado or hurricane. Such knowledge will not make you a better person or more prepared.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t believe everything you read</h3><p> Most people, because of their AB, are biased. Therefore, often what we see or hear reflects a personal bias.</p><h3> Get a hobby</h3><p> Explore previous interests. They may have faded over time because of life&rsquo;s pressures, but revisiting them will give you less time for the news and provide self-empowering entertainment.</p><h3> Meditate or pray</h3><p> Quiet time will help you return back to sanity by providing a sense of control and hope. As the saying goes, &ldquo;When we pray we talk to God. When we meditate, God talks to us.</p><h3> Electronic free day</h3><p> Take at least one day a month, preferably one a week, and free yourself from electronics. Removing yourself in this way will free up a part of yourself that you may have not seen in a while.</p><h3> Sit and talk</h3><p> Often when we gather with others, there is pressure to do something. Try sitting, talking, perhaps playing a game and laughing for a few hours. Get lost in this comradery and instantly feel saner.</p><h3> Be intimate with your partner</h3><p> Spend time holding caressing and bonding with your lover. Do this as much as possible and certainly in place of watching the news before bed!</p><h3> Educate yourself</h3><p> There is so much that we don&rsquo;t know. There is not educational prerequisite for one to learn. Pick a topic, as History, and become fascinated. Perhaps, learn a new language so that you can communicate with an entirely new set of people. </p><h3> Adopt a pet</h3><p> Having something to take care of can be empowering, life affirming, and restore sanity.</p><h3> Read material that brings out the best in you</h3><p> This could be anything from a book that aligns with your religious beliefs to a self-improvement article to a course that teaches you how to meditate.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t take yourself too seriously</h3><p> Learn to laugh at the way the AB shows itself. For me, when a crazy thought pops up in my head, it makes me laugh because I know it is the AB&rsquo;s feeble attempt to protect me at all costs.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t always believe, trust, or take direction from your Automatic Brain</h3><p> The fear that you are in constant danger will place you in constant danger. When you feel insecure, threatened or vulnerable, don&rsquo;t instantly trust the instinct. It is often derived from years of AB programming. It is the source of most insanity.</p><p> When you are able to bring the AB up to the level of awareness and consciousness, you will be surprised how it controls you&mdash;from craving the news, to stopping you from pursuing your dreams. On a larger scale you will begin to understand that it is at the core of creating an insane world. However, when you become aware, you then nourish and cultivate your mind&mdash;your sanity&mdash;and open the door to your Divine nature. </p>",

    "link": "7-no-or-low-cost-ways-to-engage-your-employees-through-recognition",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> So, how hard is it to say thank you? In Corporate America (and at home), the answer to the question is &ldquo;very hard.&rdquo; These two little words are among the most difficult for people to express. Saying thank you is quickly becoming an extinct practice both in society at large and in the workplace.</p><p> In the workplace the problem usually begins at the top of the organization and doesn&rsquo;t get much better as it works it way through the hierarchy. CEO&rsquo;s and other top leaders often don&rsquo;t take the time to say thank you and acknowledge the great work of their managers. These same frontline managers, who aren&rsquo;t appreciated themselves, tend to pass on this bad behavior to their employees. Managers expect people to just do their jobs, and in theory that should be enough, but it isn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Employees are motivated by achievement and also by recognition. There&rsquo;s a reason why engagement and recognition are often talked about together. Isn&rsquo;t it human nature to want to be acknowledged for doing a good job? It spurs us on to continue at a high level of achievement. In addition, if you spend every day doing your job well and get no positive feedback, you start to question why you are working so hard. Without consciously meaning to, people who feel underappreciated begin to disengage from the work and ultimately the workplace.</p><p> Recognition doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to mean money or gifts. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be loud or pubic either. In fact, some people actually preferred to be recognized privately. It&rsquo;s the old adage of different strokes for different folks. One of the first things a manager should find out from each and every one of their employees is how they feel about recognition &ndash; and what kind is most motivating for them &ndash; then follow through when it is earned.</p><h3> Here are some easy-to-implement recognition tips that should be in every manager&rsquo;s back pocket:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Verbally praise your employees for a job well done </strong> (privately or in public depending on their personal preferences) and be specific about the contribution that you are recognizing.</p><p> <strong>  2. Handwrite a note of thanks for a job well done. </strong> It&rsquo;s so much more meaningful than doing this through an email or quick hallway conversation.</p><p> <strong>  3. Create a &lsquo;graffiti wall&rsquo; in your work area </strong> (corkboard, whiteboard, etc.) where employees can write a note of thanks or praise for their co-workers. Only one rule&hellip; no gripes.</p><p> <strong>  4. Let others in the organization know of the great work </strong> your employee did by publicizing it through a company newsletter or intranet site.</p><p> <strong>  5. Create a silly department award such as a stuffed animal or toy </strong> that gets passed around monthly based on achievement, which the winner can display in their workspace.</p><p> <strong>  6. Tie a balloon with the word thanks to an employee&rsquo;s chair with a personal note. </strong></p><p> 7. Give someone a spot award &lsquo;in the moment&rsquo; for a job well done. It could be something as simple as a Starbucks gift card or flowers. It&rsquo;s the immediacy that means the most.</p><p> Engagement is not about programs and perks. It&rsquo;s not about pool tables and free food. It&rsquo;s not about &lsquo;the one with the most toys wins&rsquo; either. It&rsquo;s about the simple things that make people feel appreciated for all they do. So, put down your checkbook and get back to basics like saying thank you. Lack of appreciation and recognition are one of the main reasons people disengage and it&rsquo;s the easiest to fix, so why aren&rsquo;t we doing this more?</p><h3> Two words are more powerful than a thousand. It&rsquo;s all about gratitude and thanks.</h3>",

    "content": "<h3> As the spokesperson for the FBI in Northern California, I was constantly interviewed by radio, television, and newspaper reporters. If I inadvertently revealed information that was sealed by the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office, I could have been fired or even prosecuted.</h3><p> <br/> Often, I&rsquo;d fret that my words would be taken out of context or that I would be misquoted. I worried and lost sleep as I waited until for the interview to air or be printed.</p><p> As entrepreneurs and business owners, you know what it feels like to worry when times get tough and you&rsquo;re faced with uncertainty. This is when you need to be mentally strong so you can keep moving forward.</p><p> Here are 6 ways to stay mentally strong in tough times:</p><h3> 1. Control Your Thoughts</h3><p> <br/> When times get tough, the first thing we do is start to worry. But we need to control our thoughts because they control our emotions and behaviors.</p><p> Anxiety and fear are housed in our limbic brain system, but mentally tough people have figured out how to ignore them&mdash;or at least, control them.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Name Your Fear </strong></p><p> Instead of pretending that you are not scared, admit what is creating the fear. Research has indicated that recognizing and acknowledging one&rsquo;s fears are critical steps towards tackling and overcoming them.</p><p> If you try to suppress a fear or worry, it won&rsquo;t work&mdash;the brain is smarter than that. Instead, name your fear or anxiety for what it is and you will actually lessen your discomfort. It&rsquo;s very important, however, to keep the label to one or two words because if you open up a dialogue about it, you will only increase the emotional state of the limbic system.</p><h3> 2. Prepare For The Lonely Work</h3><p> <br/> Self-awareness is not a prerequisite for climbing the ladder of success&mdash;but it sure helps to keep you there.</p><p> Self-awareness empowers you because it instills a confidence that comes from a deep understanding of who you are and why you are special. It&rsquo;s called lonely work because this is one thing you truly must do for yourself.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Spend Time With Yourself </strong></p><li> Get to know what makes you tick</li><li> Learn your strengths so you can use them</li><li> Accept your weaknesses so you can minimize them</li><li> Develop your strengths and manage your weaknesses; forget about trying to change who you are by trying to &ldquo;work&rdquo; on them</li><li> Give yourself permission to shine in those areas in which you are blessed <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Get Priorities Straight</h3><p> <br/> A recent Gallup poll indicated that 90% of workers were not engaged in their jobs. This is a modern day phenomena that started after Adam Smith, the father of industrial capitalism, stated that people were naturally lazy and would work only for pay.</p><p> Mentally strong entrepreneurs and leaders understand that wages are important&mdash;of course they are! But, if you are naive enough to believe that chasing after that almighty dollar will bring you happiness, I have a piece of swamp land in Wyoming to sell you.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Engage In Work That Provides Both Value And Meaning </strong></p><p> Mentally strong people are smart enough to know that when they get their priorities straight, it does several things:</p><li> Provides work that is both engaging and meaningful</li><li> Offers opportunities to learn and grow.</li><li> Allows control over what we do and how we do it <br/>  </li><h3> 4. Take A Risk</h3><p> <br/> In firearms training I learned one thing: it&rsquo;s not risk that will kill you, it&rsquo;s complacency. Sitting in the same spot all your life will bite you in the butt when the unexpected lands at your feet because you won&rsquo;t know how to move forward with confidence and flexibility.</p><p> The mentally strong use tough times as opportunities to take a risk because they understand that risks, and the change they produce, are what will save you from a life of complacency&mdash;and stagnation.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Calculated Risks Make It Easy </strong></p><p> As an FBI agent, my colleagues and I took smart risks by planning what could go wrong, and then forging ahead.</p><p> Calculated risks mean looking at all the positive and negative outcomes and then proceeding forward by putting all of that information to best use.</p><h3> 5. Be Grateful&mdash;ALWAYS</h3><p> <br/> Gratitude is the most powerful emotion in the world. It allows you to love not only yourself, but others as well.</p><p> Mental toughness strengthens our ability to distinguish positive emotions from negative ones. We can use this awareness to strengthen positive emotions like gratitude and control negative ones like anger. </p><p> Another thing about gratitude&mdash;it is impossible to grateful and negative at the same time.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Keep Focused On Being Grateful When Life Is Taking A Down Turn </strong></p><p> We perceive an act as more worthy of gratitude when:</p><li> it cost someone (either time or effort)</li><li> it is perceived to be of value</li><li> it is not obligatory or habitual in nature</li><li> the result produces relief or happiness <br/>  </li><h3> 6. Control What You Can Control</h3><p> <br/> When making an arrest, agents are given specific assignments; for example, &ldquo;Cover the back door so the criminal can&rsquo;t run away.&rdquo;</p><p> It is the agent&rsquo;s responsibility to control what they can control; they do not worry about what others are doing or any other aspect of the arrest.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Ignore The Things You Can&rsquo;t Control </strong></p><p> In the same way, you must ignore the things over which you have no power. You have limited resources, so why waste them on things that are out of your control?</p><p> For some, it might be the politics of your organization; for others, it might be your environment. Whatever it is, realize that you can only control the things that come under your purview. You might want to save the world, but do yourself a favor and take it one step at a time.</p><p> Mental toughness separates the successful entrepreneur and business owner from the mediocre. People who are mentally strong know how to keep moving when they hit tough times.</p><p> <strong>  How have you stayed mentally strong when confronted with obstacles and adversity? </strong></p>",

    "link": "long-lost-establishing-parentage-for-intestate-succession",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Today was a big day for 28-year-old Andy. Based on a tip provided by an elderly aunt, he was finally able to locate his long-lost father. Unfortunately he also found out that his father had only hours to live and would be leaving a vast fortune behind. Andy rushed to the hospital, but by the time he got there, his father had already expired without ever meeting Andy.</p><p> Andy was grief stricken and severely disappointed. He would never know his father. Yet one question that remained was whether Andy would benefit from the fortune left behind by the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decedent.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   decedent  </a> </u> . The answer to that question depends on a number factors including:</p><p> <strong>  1. Is Andy in fact the man&rsquo;s   <u>   <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/biological-child\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    biological child   </a>  </u>  ? </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Did the man die   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intestate.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    intestate   </a>  </u>  ? </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. If the man left a   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/will.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    will   </a>  </u>  , did he acknowledge Andy in the will? </strong></p><p> The first question is a simple matter of fact. Andy was not raised by the deceased man and never met him before. Thus he must prove that he is either the biological or adopted child of the man. Proving that he is the biological child is relatively easy in modern times. Pursuant to state law, Andy is entitled to have a judge order that  <u>  <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/DNA+testing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DNA  </a> </u>  samples be taken from Andy and the decedent and then compared. If Andy is a genetic match to the decedent, then he is the biological child of the decedent and is entitled to the same rights as any acknowledged biological child.</p><p> While it is unlikely that Andy would have been adopted and not aware of the adoption, it is not beyond possibility. To prove  <u>  <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/adoption\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   adoption  </a> </u> , Andy would need to demonstrate that the decedent formally adopted him prior to his death.</p><p> The second question is important, because if the decedent died intestate, and Andy was his biological child, then Andy is entitled to a portion of the man&rsquo;s estate under  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/intestate-succession-new-jersey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New Jersey&rsquo;s intestacy laws  </a> </u> . Depending upon who else survived the decedent (e.g., spouse or other children) Andy might be a primary or sole  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heir.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   heir  </a> </u> .</p><p> Things can get a little more complicated if the decedent left a will. It is possible that although Andy did not know who his father was, the father was in fact aware of Andy. In that event, the father may have provided for Andy in a will or expressly named Andy, but decided to leave him a nominal gift of $1.00 or less. If Andy was completely omitted from the will, and can prove parentage, then he may be entitled to an inheritance under  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.njlaws.com/3b_5-16.html?id=2202&amp;a=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   New Jersey&rsquo;s Omitted Children law (NJSA 3B:5-16)  </a> </u> .</p><p> Establishing parentage for purposes of intestate succession is a complex and hazard-fraught process. That&rsquo;s why anyone pursuing or defending a parentage claim should consult with a qualified  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   estate planning  </a> </u>  attorney. </p>",

    "title": "What You Should Know About Itemized Deductions",
    "link": "what-you-should-know-about-itemized-deductions",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> For many people, our biggest priority at tax time is to get everything done quickly and painlessly, with little to no financial penalties. This usually means many people take the standard versus the itemized deduction in an effort to same time &mdash; and perhaps under the assumption that their itemized deductions will end up being less than or equal to the standard deduction anyway.</p><p> But depending on your situation, it may make the most financial sense for you to itemize your deductions. In some cases, you may be able to deduct more from your taxes by itemizing than by taking the standard deduction. Review the following to determine if an itemized deduction would work best for you.</p><h3> Standard Versus Itemized Deductions</h3><p> <br/> At a basic level, tax deductions reduce your taxable income. Whether you take the standard deduction or itemize, everyone files for a deduction on their taxable income. The more you reduce your taxable income, the smaller your tax bill will be. Determining whether the standard deduction or the itemized deduction depends on your personal situation.</p><p> The standard deduction amount is adjusted for inflation each year, and is higher for blind taxpayers and those who are 65 years old or older. According to the IRS, approximately 2 out of every 3 taxpayers claims the standard deduction on their tax returns. In 2015, the standard deduction amounts are:</p><li> Single (Unmarried Individuals):  $6,300, an increase of $100 from 2014</li><li> Married Filing Separately:  $6,300, an increase of $100</li><li> Head of Household:  $9,250, an increase of $150</li><li> Married Taxpayers Filing Jointly and Qualifying Widow(er)s:  $12,600, an increase of $200 <br/>  </li><p> You can always choose the standard deduction. But if you&rsquo;re not sure your itemized deductions are more than the standard deduction, it&rsquo;s worth it to go through and itemize to see if you could claim a larger deduction.</p><h3> Requirements to Itemize</h3><p> <br/> In some cases, you may be required to file for itemized deductions instead of taking the standard deduction. Not every taxpayer qualifies for standard deductions, including  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/7-money-moves-financially-savvy-couples/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   married couples  </a> </u>  who file separate and one spouse itemizes. If one spouse itemizes, then both will have to itemize.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re unsure if you should itemize, first visit the IRS&rsquo;  <u>  Interactive Tax Assistant </u>  tool to help determine if itemizing or choosing the standard deduction is best for you.</p><h3> Deciding to Take Itemized Deductions</h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve determined you should itemize, it&rsquo;s important to figure out your itemized deductions. You may need to go through old receipts or statements you&rsquo;ve collected throughout the year; tax time is when it pays to be organized.</p><p> Deductible expenses you can itemize include:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/saving-down-payment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Home mortgage interest  </a> </u></li><li> State and local income taxes or sales taxes (but not both)</li><li> Real estate and personal property taxes</li><li> Gifts to charities</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/property-and-casualty-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Casualty or theft losses  </a> </u></li><li> Unreimbursed medical expenses</li><li> Unreimbursed employee business expenses <br/>  </li><p> There are special rules to this list, and limits do apply. Visit IRS.gov and refer to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Publication-17\" target=\"_blank\">   Publication 17  </a> </u> , Your Federal Income Tax for more information. (And remember, if all this is getting confusing &mdash; you can always ask a pro to help you!  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/money-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Putting together your money team  </a> </u>  is a critical step to success with your finances.)</p><p> If you do decide to itemize, keep in mind that not every dollar can be subtracted from your income. For instance, you have to reach a 2% of income threshold before you can itemize miscellaneous deductions, like unreimbursed job expenses and tax preparation costs. There are also limits to the deduction amount of large charitable contributions.</p><h3> Special Considerations</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ll also want to take these special considerations into account:</p><p> Home ownership: If you have a mortgage or home equity loan on your home, fill out  <u>  <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Tax-Deductions-and-Credits/What-is-a-Schedule-A-IRS-form-/INF14420.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Schedule A  </a> </u>  to determine if your itemized deductions are larger than the standard tax deduction.</p><p> In January, your mortgage lender should send you the amount of mortgage interest you paid the previous year. If the interest you paid on your mortgage is larger than your standard deduction, it would benefit you to itemize. Even if your mortgage interest doesn&rsquo;t quite exceed your standard deduction, your other itemized expenses may help put you over the standard deduction amount.</p><p> Charitable deductions: It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind you can deduct charitable donations only if you itemize your deductions. Add up the amounts you&rsquo;ve donated to charities. This includes material items you may have donated, like furniture or clothes. You can use  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/publications/p561/ar02.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Publication 561  </a> </u>  to help you determine the value of your donated items.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re donating more than $250 in items, you&rsquo;ll want to get a receipt or some type of documentation acknowledging your donation. </p><p> Medical costs: Before beginning to itemize unreimbursed medical expenses, remember that you can only deduct costs to the extent that your expenses exceed 10% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). If your AGI is $50,000, the first $5,000 in unreimbursed medical expenses do not count.</p><p> Before going through your medical bills and prescription receipts, make sure to do a quick calculation to ensure you&rsquo;re not wasting your time.</p><p> If your medical costs do exceed your AGI, continue to itemize on your doctor bills, prescription costs, as well as dentist, chiropractor, and lab charges. You can also include contact lenses, glasses, prescription drugs and medical supplies. If you&rsquo;re not sure if a particular medical expense counts, refer to  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  IRS Publication 502 </a> .</p><p> Other miscellaneous expenses you may be able to deduct include:</p><li> Union or other professional organization dues</li><li> The cost of protective work clothing or uniforms you&rsquo;re required to wear to work</li><li> Expenses incurred while  <u>  job searching </u> , like resume review costs, career counseling, etc.</li><li> Subscriptions to magazines and other publications related to your work</li><li> Fees charged by the financial company that manages  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/401k-vs-roth-ira-which-is-right-for-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your IRA account  </a> </u> , but only if you don&rsquo;t pay the maintenance fees directly from your IRA</li><li> Tuition for classes that maintain or improve skills directly related to your current job</li><li> Depreciation on your computer or cellphone, but only for the time you use that equipment as part of your job <br/>  </li><h3> Understanding Alternative Minimum Tax</h3><p> <br/> The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally designed to keep wealthy taxpayers from using loopholes to avoid paying taxes. But as it&rsquo;s not adjusted for inflation, more middle-class taxpayers  <u>  <a href=\"https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/IRS-Tax-Return/Alternative-Minimum-Tax--Common-Questions/INF12072.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fall under AMT rules each year  </a> </u> .</p><p> Determining if you&rsquo;re subjected to the AMT means calculating your tax liability twice: once under the rules of the regular income tax code, and once under AMT rules. You must pay whichever is higher. To figure out if you owe additional tax under AMT, fill out (or have your accountant fill out) Form 6251. If this amount is higher than what was calculated on your regular tax return, you have to pay the difference.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re unsure you&rsquo;ll fall under AMT rules, visit the IRS&rsquo;  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Alternative-Minimum-Tax-(AMT)-Assistant-for-Individuals\" target=\"_blank\">   AMT Assistant  </a> </u>  to determine whether or not you&rsquo;ll need to fill out Form 6251 at tax time.</p><p> Once you decide to itemize your deductions, you&rsquo;re not bound to itemize every year in the future. If you need to file for the standard deduction the following year, you can do so in most cases. Your goal is to use the deduction method that gives you the lowest tax bill, and many software programs as well as tax professionals can help you determine with method is best for you.</p>",

Some organizations are even  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/so-hows-atos-no-email-project-coming/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eliminating email altogether  </a> </u> .</p><p> &ldquo;In my own workday, email has become less and less important,&rdquo; writes John Brandon in  Inc. , who predicts that email will be extinct by 2020. &ldquo;There are entire groups of people (public relations, for one) who contact me primarily on social networks first. Friends never send email anymore. They almost always send a text or chat on Facebook. Even a few of my colleagues tend to use apps like  <u>  <a href=\"https://campfirenow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Campfire  </a> </u>  more than email.&rdquo;</p><p> But  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/29/the-last-and-ultimate-social-graph/?ncid=rss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   email still has a lot of value  </a> </u> , writes Zvi Band in  TechCrunch . Unlike alternatives such as social media or texting, mail is ubiquitous,  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/its-your-fault-email-is-broken/?ncid=rss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   asynchronous  </a> </u> , open, cheap, and adaptable, he writes. In addition, it&rsquo;s not controlled by a central authority like a social media company, and users typically don&rsquo;t have to worry about the vendor disappearing, he adds. &ldquo;With the Internet having matured into the profit-driven current era of technology, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine any social medium coming to rise that offers the same value as email.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;A picture with some text that&rsquo;s available for three seconds will  <u>  <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2015/01/23/lost-art-of-emailing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never capture the same spirit of an email  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; writes Justin Conklin in  ReadWrite . &ldquo;Social media offers are fast, quick communication and get the job done, but they detract from the very essence of why we communicate: To form and nurture a connection.&rdquo;</p><p> Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s more email users&mdash; <u>  <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2015/01/23/lost-art-of-emailing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   4.5 billion  </a> </u>  by this year, worldwide&mdash;and more email than ever&mdash;at least  <u>  183 billion email messages </u>  every day. (Believe it or not,  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/17/symantec-spam-falls-below-50-of-all-email-for-the-first-time-since-2003/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   less than half of that is spam  </a> </u> .) With all that email, how do you make sure yours stands out from the crowd?</p><h3> How to Say What You Want to Say</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Make your message appropriate to your role. </strong>  It turns out that it&rsquo;s easy to tell whether someone is sending an email message up the hierarchy to their boss, or down the hierarchy to their subordinate, simply by analyzing their word choices, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw12.hierarchy.gilbert.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Georgia Institute of Technology study  </a> </u> . (In fact, the study might  <u>  <a href=\"http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw12.hierarchy.gilbert.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eventually be incorporated into software  </a> </u>  that handles your email for you.)</p><p> Phrases such as &ldquo;the ability to,&rdquo; &ldquo;attach,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I took&rdquo; are more likely to be used in  <u>  <a href=\"http://priceonomics.com/the-linguistics-of-writing-an-email-like-a-boss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   email messages to bosses  </a> </u> , while &ldquo;have you been,&rdquo; &ldquo;to manage the,&rdquo; and &ldquo;you gave&rdquo; are more likely to be used in email messages to subordinates, writes Rosie Cima in the  Pricenomics  blog.</p><p> At the same time, though, avoid using language that  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/9-phrases-that-make-you-sound-less-experienced-than-you-are\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   makes you sound more subordinate  </a> </u> , warns  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/author/adrian-g-larssen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Adrian Granzella Larssen  </a> </u>  in  The Muse , such as &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have to ask my boss,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is that OK?&rdquo; &ldquo;While you shouldn&rsquo;t go to the other end of the spectrum and act like you&rsquo;re more important than the rest of your team, you should never feel afraid to present yourself confidently as a peer,&rdquo; she writes.</p><p> <strong>  Make sure your message looks good. </strong>  It might seem trivial, but the  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/07/27/email-font-ruining-life/#7PYl6d1RLgqW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   default fonts used by many email programs  </a> </u>  and services these days aren&rsquo;t optimal for reading, writes Rebecca Greenfield in  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/07/27/email-font-ruining-life/#7PYl6d1RLgqW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bloomberg Business  </u>  . </a>  &ldquo;Email &ldquo;clients&rdquo; &mdash; the programs you use to check your email, like Gmail, Apple Mail, and Outlook &mdash; tend to favor sans serif fonts, in which the letters don&rsquo;t have end strokes, like Helvetica, Arial, and Microsoft Outlook&rsquo;s default Calibri,&rdquo; she writes. But serif fonts are easier to read, she notes.</p><p> And think business-appropriate, writes Barbara Pachter in her book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Essentials-Business-Etiquette-Success/dp/0071811265?tag=bisafetynet-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Essentials Of Business Etiquette  </a> </u> .  &ldquo;Purple Comic Sans has a time and a place (maybe?), but for business correspondence, keep your fonts, colors, and sizes classic.&rdquo;</p><h3> What to Avoid Doing</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Avoid being passive-aggressive or insensitive. </strong>  If your mom ever got on your case for your &ldquo;tone,&rdquo; you know what this is about. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://simplicity.laserfiche.com/why-you-need-care-about-semantic-web/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   IBM&rsquo;s Watson semantic web system  </a> </u>  now offers a  <u>  <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/07/16/ibm-watson-tone-analyzer-service-experimental-release-announcement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tone Analyzer  </a> </u>  to determine emotional, social, and writing style tones, writes Lance Ulanoff in Mashable.  Not only does it chide you for your &ldquo;tone,&rdquo; but it  <u>  <a href=\"https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   offers suggestions  </a> </u>  on how to improve it.</p><p> Similarly to Watson,  <u>  <a href=\"http://alexjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Alex  </a> </u>  looks for words that are  <u>  <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/09/11/alex-stops-you-from-publishing-inconsiderate-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business-inappropriate, insensitive, or inconsiderate  </a> </u> .  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to come off as more abrupt that you might have intended &mdash; you meant &lsquo;straightforward,&rsquo; they read &lsquo;angry and curt,&rsquo;&rdquo; Pachter writes.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Best,&rdquo; or, in fact,   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/the-best-e-mail-signature-is-actually-the-worst\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    any kind of closing   </a>  </u>  . </strong> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sign off at all.&rdquo; writes Greenfield in  Bloomberg Business . &ldquo;Tacking a best onto the end of an email can read as archaic, like a mom-style voice mail. Signoffs interrupt the flow of a conversation, anyway, and that&rsquo;s what email is.&rdquo; Similarly, avoid too-colloquial greetings such as &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Pachter writes.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve become so busy in my work life that last week I locked myself in a hotel room for four straight days solely to work. There&rsquo;s no need to feel badly for me. It was a really nice hotel and the eleven room-service meals were delicious.</p><p> Not seeing the light of day during a stretch of four 70-degree Chicago-days in November was a bummer. Even so, it was important for me to spend uninterrupted time building products and services I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy.</p><p> My work marathon continued into the weekend. On Saturday, five hours into my workday, I glared at my 27&Prime; monitor. I kept sliding my fingers down the Mac Track Pad, but the email list simply wouldn&rsquo;t die.</p><p> Looking at the screen felt like something I&rsquo;d seen in a movie. The letters became blurry, but as I skimmed the messages the words &ldquo;need,&rdquo; &ldquo;want,&rdquo; &ldquo;favor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;help&rdquo; seemed to have a giant magnifying glass over them.</p><p> I looked down at my fur babies. They always lie faithfully in contortionist-like positions at my feet when I work. A tear ran down my cheek. I felt tired, overwhelmed, guilty and a host of other icky feelings. The life I worked so hard to attain was simply taunting me&mdash;to take control.</p><p> I turned to them and cheerfully asked, &ldquo;Hide and seek?&rdquo; They leapt with a force you could understand only if you&rsquo;ve ever owned a Dachshund.</p><p> Off I dashed with a handful of treats hiding in the closets, bathrooms, and corners of my house awaiting their arrival with upright tails.</p><p> When I returned to my desk, I wrote this blog post.</p><p> Sometimes, you simply need to take control of your life and politely say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to your many requests. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t plan and control your life, someone else will. Here are my favorite eight ways to politely say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><h3> The Ego Stroke</h3><p> <br/> I didn&rsquo;t save the best for last. This might be my favorite of my favorites. I learned this from the master herself, my fianc&eacute;e Lynda. I&rsquo;m sure she thinks I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s doing, but it goes a little something like this.</p><p> Me: &ldquo;Honey, can you do this for me?&rdquo;</p><p> Her: &ldquo;Oh. Dear, you&rsquo;re so much better at that than I am. It&rsquo;ll turn out better if you do it.&rdquo;</p><p> Ah. She is a sneaky one. Adorable. But sneaky.</p><h3> The Self-Deprecation</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t like stroking someone&rsquo;s ego? No problem! Use the self-deprecation technique.</p><p> Her: &ldquo;Can you help me with this?&rdquo;</p><p> You: &ldquo;Oh. I&rsquo;m so bad that. It&rsquo;ll turn out much better if you do it. I&rsquo;m afraid to ruin it and I just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live with myself if I messed it up.&rdquo;</p><h3> The &ldquo;Look&rdquo; of Silence</h3><p> <br/> Whenever someone asks you, either in person or over the phone, to do something, you can use a slight pause to gauge the situation. Many times, the person will withdraw the request before you respond. Other times, the person might fill the silence with an indication of how urgent or important the request is. Either way, you have more insight than you did three seconds earlier.</p><h3> The Choice</h3><p> <br/> People love the opportunity to choose! I like to give people choices when I want to help them, but can&rsquo;t fully commit. This sounds likes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to help you move on Saturday, but my back is sore. Would you like $300 for movers?&rdquo; You get the gist.</p><h3> The Deprioritize (AKA The Upward Choice)</h3><p> <br/> The Deprioritize is another choice option and is best used when dealing with superiors at work. It sounds like, &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Boss Man, I&rsquo;d love to add that 19th project to my plate. Can you please let me know which of the other 18 I should remove or deprioritize?&rdquo;</p><h3> The Delay</h3><p> <br/> I love the delay. It often sounds like, &ldquo;Let me check my calendar and get back to you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask my husband and get back to you,&rdquo; and so on. It&rsquo;s effective when you need to catch your breath and see how your calendar or workload shapes up.</p><h3> The Auto Response</h3><p> <br/> Everyone has received one of those Out-of-Office email auto-responders. Feel free to use them when you&rsquo;re sitting at your desk and don&rsquo;t want to be bothered by something that is likely unimportant and doing nothing but adding to-dos you don&rsquo;t want or need. It has all the same details: why you are occupied (you don&rsquo;t need to be specific!), when you can respond, and an alternative in case of emergency.</p><h3> The Hot Potato</h3><p> <br/> As much as you like to think everyone needs you, no one is unique when it comes to helping. The hot potato sounds like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to help you, but am tied up. You should give John a call. He&rsquo;s really good at that stuff.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  What are your best techniques for saying &ldquo;No?&rdquo; </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born-that there is a genetic factor to leadership. That&rsquo;s nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.&rdquo; &mdash;Warren Bennis</p><h3> <strong>  Who Are They? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Leadership is not about a position; it can come from anyone. It is taking place all around us on a daily basis. Being a true leader goes beyond a title or position; it grows from the respect and credibility that is earned when working with others. This respect and credibility allows everyday leaders to influence and guide those around them without possessing formal authority or power. So, how are these everyday leaders able to impact your organization?</p><h3> Relationships</h3><p> Research has shown that followers often have a greater influence over the process of leadership than those who hold formal leadership positions. The everyday leader gains support based on relationships without holding a formal position of authority. And, relationships are the key to holding teams together. Successful leadership is dependent on more than just the relationships and behaviors of a single, formal leader; every individual within an organization can make a meaningful contribution to leadership. By developing and maintaining trusting relationships, these leaders are able to collaborate, share knowledge, influence group thinking, and impact team effectiveness.</p><h3> Respect</h3><p> Everyday leaders are often seen as friendly, open, trustworthy, experienced, and always willing to help. These leaders are out on the floor, they are in touch with what is going on, they have a network of resources, and often have access to information that formal leaders miss. They have a vested interest in the success of their department, team, and organization. All of these characteristics factor into the respect that everyday leaders earn from colleagues. This respect is a great source of power for everyday leaders. These leaders influence the culture of the organization through their willingness to get involved, share knowledge and expertise, and support their team.</p><h3> Support</h3><p> Everyone needs to know that their contributions are adding value. Everyday leaders play the role of coach and supporter with an emphasis on helping others succeed. They create a sense of community where everyone knows their work is meaningful and appreciated. They encourage trust, collaboration, and a safe place to communicate. It is through their support of others that everyday leaders gain respect, trust, and influence.</p><h3> Cooperation</h3><p> Everyday leaders understand the effectiveness and importance of shared responsibility. Shared responsibility and cooperation improve the opportunity for the organization to benefit from the individual strengths of employees. When employees are given the opportunity to participate in planning and decision-making, it sends the message that they are trusted, recognized, and valued. Cooperation helps employees build on the momentum of others while working together to achieve common goals. Everyday leaders emphasize cooperation because they know what it&rsquo;s like to be left on the sidelines by those in a position of authority and how difficult it is to work effectively under those conditions.</p><h3> <strong>  Why Do They Matter? </strong></h3><p> <br/> In every organization, there is an unacknowledged system through which work is accomplished. This system will not be found on any organizational chart. This system is guided by everyday leaders who are relied upon heavily yet are often unappreciated. These everyday leaders use influence, the building of relationships, knowledge, and expertise to advocate for the organization and enhance the contributions of employees.</p><p> Everyday leaders gain support through respect and relationship building without holding a position of authority. But, why do they matter? In a nutshell, the reason everyday leaders matter is influence. Those who can influence are those who get results. This has a big impact, whether for good or bad, on your organization. Everyday leaders have the potential to influence employees to either pursue the agenda of the organization, or their own agenda; the priorities of the organization, or conflicting priorities; the timelines of the organization, or those of their own design.</p><p> Power and influence is no longer held only by those in a position of authority, it is shared throughout the organization by employees at every level. Everyday leadership is powerful, more powerful than most formal leaders recognize. And, if you don&rsquo;t recognize it, you lose the opportunity to harness its power for the good of the whole.</p><p> The culture of the organization can either hinder or promote everyday leadership. A culture that empowers everyday leaders to make a positive contribution to the organization promotes encouragement, opportunity, and the sharing of ideas and knowledge. Sharing in the leadership responsibility improves the quality of decision-making and strengthens the commitment to decisions made. Everyday leadership gives employees a voice and management an advocate.</p><p> Formal leaders should serve as facilitators; they should encourage empowerment and participation. Everyday leaders relieve formal leaders of the responsibility to control everything. This allows them to focus their energies on the important tasks of planning and coordination.</p><p> There is a limit to a formal leader&rsquo;s ability to exercise influence, wield authority, and exert power. Leadership should be seen as dynamic and fluid rather than fixed. It is an emergent property where a group of individuals bring their expertise together in pursuit of a shared goal. And, it is in this environment where everyday leaders make their impact. Learn to recognize the everyday leaders in your organization; harness their power for the good of all.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The dark nights are creeping up on us and so it&rsquo;s at this time of year that I like to pull out my paper lanterns and brighten the atmosphere in my home. Our latest paper cut lantern pattern is perfect for those makers with a cutting machine. It is delicate and is full of intricate leaf patterns that a cutting machine can achieve easily. Of course you can use the PDF pattern to cut this lantern by hand if you want to. But with a cutting machine you can click on the SVG file below and have it cut and ready to assemble in minutes. </p><p> We used a shimmering metallic paper for our paper cut lanterns, with a vellum paper window and battery operated LED lights inside. Assembling this pattern with a low temperature glue gun is the quickest and easiest way to put it together, but if you don&rsquo;t have one, then a good paper glue is fine too &ndash; you can shop this post below if you want to get yourself a glue gun, I couldn&rsquo;t do what I do without mine!

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s not enough these days to post a job listing on your company website and hope that the candidate of your dreams will apply. You need to be active to attract talent, or else someone is going to snatch up that dream employee. In order to compete, you need to make sure your recruitment strategies are to snuff.</p><h3> What is Social Recruiting?</h3><p> Nowadays, the name of the recruiting game is social: social media.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jobvite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jobvite_SocialRecruiting_Survey2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jobvite  </a> </u>  found that social media has been used by 73% of recruiters to hire candidates. And don&rsquo;t assume this trend is all flash and no substance. According to Jobvite and  <u>  LinkedIn and Altimeter Group </u> :</p><li> 44% of recruiters say that social recruiting has increased both the quantity and quality of candidates</li><li> Socially engaged companies are 58% more likely to attract top talent</li><p> It&rsquo;s not surprising. Social media lets you learn more about prospective employees than a resume on its own, whether it&rsquo;s because you can see their endorsements on LinkedIn, or their personality on Facebook helps you gauge their potential fit with your company culture.</p><p> As for candidates, getting to know a company&rsquo;s culture through social media can be a powerful draw.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s take a look at how you can make the most out of social media. Each property has its own unique feature that you'll want to leverage for maximum gain.</p><h3> How to Leverage Twitter <strong>  1. Make use of your network </strong> If you have a great job, ask your followers to share it out. Just don&rsquo;t do it too often. That gets annoying. <strong>  2. Rejoice in hashtags </strong> Those little &ldquo;#&rdquo; symbols before every word count. Use them. If you&rsquo;re posting about a marketing job in Atlanta consider #Marketing #Job in #ATL. And if you need a little guidance with which hashtags to use, try a tool like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hashtracking.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hashtracking  </a> </u> . <strong>  3. Search for colloquialisms </strong> If you want to do outreach to potential recruits, know the local lingo. For instance, while a developer on LinkedIn might say Ruby on Rails, on Twitter expect RoR. Or they might use Jet City instead of Seattle. <h3>  How to Leverage Facebook  <strong>   1. Try out Facebook ads  </strong>  People share so much on Facebook &mdash; use it to target them. Do you need someone with a certain degree, someone that lives in a particular city, someone two years out of college? Facebook&rsquo;s robust ad platform lets you target exactly who you want, and remove anyone you don&rsquo;t. You can also retarget ads to people who have already visited your Careers page. You know these people are already interested in your company, so Facebook retargeting ensures that they keep seeing your brand.  <strong>   2. Create a jobs tab  </strong>  There are countless apps that let you add a Jobs tab to the top of your Company page.   <u>   LinkUp  </u>   is just one example. This helps put your open jobs in front of the people who love your company and its products the most.  <strong>   3. Create a job-specific page  </strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://recruitmentbuzz.co.uk/how-loreal-use-social-media-for-recruitment-case-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al&rsquo;s Facebook pages   </a>  </u>   are an model of recruitment success. Its   <u>   <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LorealCareersUS?brand_redir=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al Careers page   </a>  </u>   has almost 215,000 Likes and has become a dedicated hub to post job openings, answer questions from candidates, and share behind-the-scenes photos to give a sense of the company culture.  <h3>   How to Leverage LinkedIn   <strong>    1. Test LinkedIn Recruiter   </strong>   Do you want access to the entire network of professionals on LinkedIn? You can have it ... for a price. Depending on your needs, LinkedIn offers a few plans to personally connect with that perfect candidate. If you do commit to spending money, try their Recruiter Lite version first. It&rsquo;s less of a hit on your wallet and probably has most of the features you need.   <strong>    2. Target candidates with ads   </strong>   Just like Facebook, people share all about their professional lives on LinkedIn. Use this shared information to target individuals at specific companies and with specific job titles.   <strong>    3. Take advantage of Groups   </strong>   Imagine talking to a whole bunch of people who do exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for. There&rsquo;s a LinkedIn Group for that. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking to recruit an inbound marketer. You&rsquo;d want to join the Inbound Marketers Group, which has nearly 115,000 members! Groups can get pretty niche, which is great when you&rsquo;re searching for a very particular type of individual.   <h3>    How to Leverage Pinterest    <strong>     1. Highlight culture    </strong>    The visual nature of Pinterest makes it the perfect place to feature company culture, employees, and your brand personality to attract people who could really fit in. Pin photos of company lunches or happy hours, your office space, or latest projects.Have employees represent themselves and their work, adding a personal touch to the board. Pinterest lets you expose your brand to a new audience and share your culture in an authentic way.   </h3>  </h3> </h3></h3><br /><h3> How to Leverage Instagram or Vine <strong>  1. Explore portfolios </strong> We don&rsquo;t mean this in the literal sense &mdash; candidates are not uploading their actual portfolios to Instagram or Vine. But you can definitely find snippets of their work if you know where to look. Are you hiring for a videographer or content producer? Search different channels in Vine to find people with experience creating content in different niches (comedy, food, travel, sports, etc).If you&rsquo;re looking for an illustrator, graphic designer, artist, interior design, or chef (among many other things), search hashtags on Instagram to see pictures of their work (the hashtags can be as simple as #interiordesign or #veganchef).</h3><p> Try just a couple recruitment strategies from one social network first. Once you feel comfortable, ramp up to your next network.</p><h3> Recruitmen Case Study</h3><p> Our client  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.geeks2u.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Geeks2U  </a> </u> , an Australian tech support company, came up with an innovative strategy that leverages their strong culture to attract applicants. Geeks2U needs to find top-class and friendly talent. After all, they&rsquo;re in the business of providing great customer service. Rather than just saying they&rsquo;re a great place to work, they prove it.</p><p> Take a look at the screen shot below, taken from their  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.geeks2u.com.au/about-us/join-geeks2u/customer-service-specialist/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Join Our Team  </a> </u>  page:</p><img alt=\"Geeks2U uses TINYpulse in their recruitment strategies\" src=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/443262/file-2606945701-png/Geeks2U.png?t=1447881927394\"/><p> Geeks2U is using actual numbers to show that they have a great work culture. First, they display their individual happiness scores over time, easily showing prospects that Geeks2U has some very happy employees. And thanks to TINYpulse&rsquo;s company benchmark reporting, they&rsquo;re able to show that they are above average when it comes to employee happiness.</p><p> If you were a job candidate choosing between a culture you knew was positive, and one you knew nothing about, which would you choose? That&rsquo;s right, the positive one.</p><p> Companies using employee engagement surveys should consider publicizing their results on their websites and other platforms job candidates use to assess a company. If you&rsquo;re like Geeks2U and you have really positive feedback, it&rsquo;s an incredibly effective recruitment strategy.</p><br /><h3> Creative Recruitment Strategies</h3><p> Digital strategies aren&rsquo;t the only ones you need, of course. Here&rsquo;s a list of 10 creative techniques you can add to your recruitment arsenal:</p><p> <strong>  1. Referral incentives </strong></p><p> Get your existing employees to refer their friends and colleagues. Current employees know your company culture, so they&rsquo;ll be able to pick people who will fit in. You can offer a monetary incentive, a free lunch, or some other perk.</p><p> <strong>  2. Pay them to leave </strong></p><p> Zappos has a great policy where they pay new recruits who aren&rsquo;t a cultural fit to leave. If they don&rsquo;t like the culture and aren&rsquo;t fitting in, Zappos encourages their departure to avoid polluting the culture they work so hard to build.</p><p> <strong>  3. Sponsor an open house </strong></p><p> Invite people to your office for drinks and snacks and just get chatting.</p><p> <strong>  4. Attend events that are NOT job fairs </strong></p><p> Look on sites like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meetup.com  </a> </u>  or your local chamber of commerce to see what events are happening in your area. You&rsquo;ll get to network with relevant professionals that could be just what you need.</p><p> <strong>  5. Consider past candidates </strong></p><p> Remember that really awesome person you loved meeting but just didn&rsquo;t have the right skills for a role? Maybe your needs have changed and now they&rsquo;re the perfect fit.</p><p> <strong>  6. Sponsor school clubs and events </strong></p><p> Do you need young candidates excited about marketing? Or maybe candidates ready to jump into the entertainment industry? Look to local universities and colleges and support student clubs in your field. It&rsquo;ll put you top of mind when they&rsquo;re looking for jobs.</p><p> <strong>  7. Focus on fit </strong></p><p> Sometimes you find a person with a personality and can-do attitude you love, but they&rsquo;re light on the skills you need. Consider training them up or supporting their continued education.</p><p> <strong>  8. Talk about culture </strong></p><p> When we tell employees about giving away 1% of our product to non profits and 1% of our time to community organizations, they perk up. Leverage the interesting things about your work culture that make you stand apart.</p><p> <strong>  9. Say hello with joe </strong></p><p> In a formal interview setting, candidates are nervous and are overthinking every answer. Casual coffee meetings allow you to see them in a new light and build personal connections. You&rsquo;ll also gain valuable insights and find the right cultural fit for your company by being able to observe the candidate in the new context.</p><p> <strong>  10. Focus on perks that matter </strong></p><p> Many companies don&rsquo;t have the budget to offer free lunches every day, free parking, or weekly workplace happy hours. While those perks sure are fun, do they provide real value to candidates? Instead of focusing on the &ldquo;free,&rdquo; consider what&rsquo;s really important to employees &mdash; offer strong mentorship programs or lots of opportunities for career growth.</p><h3> Watch Out for Word of Mouth</h3><p> Even people who don&rsquo;t have contact with a candidate can impact their decision to join. What do the actions of your organization &mdash; and even those outside of it &mdash; tell the rest of the world about your company?</p><p> <strong>  1. What Do People Think of You? </strong></p><p> The age of social media means that bad news about a company&rsquo;s behavior can become very public very quickly. It can create a bad reputation that haunts an organization, with ripples that reach potential applicants. Respondents to a survey from  <u>  <a href=\"http://employers.glassdoor.com/blog/why-a-companys-reputation-matters-even-in-a-bad-economy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CR Magazine and Allegis Talent2  </a> </u>  say that what they hear about an organization affects their job decisions:</p><li> 75% wouldn&rsquo;t work for a company with a bad reputation even if they were unemployed</li><p> And for those who would say yes? Many of them would only accept a job at a company with a poor reputation for significantly more money:</p><li> One-quarter said they would need more than a 50% pay raise</li><li> 15% said they would need more than double their salary</li><p> Even once they join a company, respondents would be swayed by what others are saying:</p><li> 87% would consider leaving their company for one with an excellent reputation</li><li> Most would only need a 1% to 10% pay raise in order to leave</li><p> If your company makes a poor showing in the world of public opinion, don&rsquo;t be surprised if new hires jump ship&mdash;or never sign on in the first place.</p><p> <strong>  2. What Do Applicants Think of You? </strong></p><p> Reputations aren&rsquo;t just about splashy scandals that make headlines. They can be created from unexpected sources. You may think that a recruiter only makes an impression on the applicant they&rsquo;re interacting with, but  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=6/20/2012&amp;id=pr703&amp;ed=12/31/2012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CareerBuilder  </a> </u>  found that many applicants would share bad experiences:</p><li> Over three-fourths would tell family and friends</li><li> 17% would post on social media</li><li> 6% would blog about it</li><p> Poor communication during the application process, a rude interviewer &mdash; it could all end up shared with the online world at large, free to be read by someone you might want to hire.</p><p> <strong>  3. What Do Your Employees Think of You? </strong></p><p> And maybe the most important opinion of all comes from your current employees. Even though recruitment strategies have gone digital in recent years, the members of your organization are still vital in finding you new recruits. According to a  <u>  CareerXroads </u>  report, employee referrals are the single most significant source of hires, right above career websites.</p><p> This means that employee engagement and satisfaction affect more than just your current company &mdash; what your people say to their friends and colleagues can shape the future of your organization. If your employees are unhappy and telling potential candidates about it, you could lose out on the talent you want to hire.</p><p> Give your employees a chance to give you feedback, and then act on their concerns before unhappiness has a chance to fester. Listen to how TINYpulse client  <u>  Blue Box </u>  made use of anonymous feedback tools to make employees feel heard and stay happy even through a tough business transition:</p><p> Recruitment strategies are more than waving sky-high salaries and fancy perks in candidates&rsquo; faces. The real way to get top talent is to use resources like social media and your own creativity to make yourself stand out from the competition.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Year-end commentaries are coming. And they&rsquo;ll stop for no one. Commentaries involve content from many sources, need numerous reviews and approvals, and have non-negotiable timelines.</p><p> To make the process as streamlined as possible, it helps to compile some key information in one document &ndash; and as early in the process as possible. This can remove a lot of the stress that comes with this project.</p><h3> Create a fund info list</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s worth the time to create a reliable reference list that includes full and correct information for things that need to be precise, or that you need to check often. Include:</p><h3> 1. Fund names</h3><p> Use exact names &ndash; is it Canadian Small Cap Fund or Canadian Small-Cap Fund? Be sure to update this list with any new mandates or name changes (TIP: a Simplified Prospectus is often the best place to confirm full fund names).</p><h3> 2. Benchmark names</h3><p> Again, be precise, because these are difficult to check against external sources. Even the index providers themselves can use different names on their websites, so your company&rsquo;s style should be followed.</p><h3> 3. Portfolio manager and sub-advisor names</h3><p> Keep an exact list and update it regularly, since sub-advisors change often and companies&rsquo; legal names do as well.</p><h3> 4. Underlying funds</h3><p> The more exact the list, the easier it will be to cross-reference your information. This becomes more important as your firm launches more fund-of-fund and managed portfolio solutions.</p><h3> 5. Inception date</h3><p> This information will help your writers know how to position the attribution information in the MRFP commentaries. Again, if your firm is expanding its product shelf, you can avoid wasted time working on MRFPs that should not have performance info.</p><h3> Bonus tip: think of your translators</h3><p> If you also produce material in French, a version of this list with your company&rsquo;s chosen French terminology will be invaluable for translation. This document could literally save your firm hours of work.</p><h3> Next steps</h3><p> <br/> Share this list with your writers, editors, reviewers &ndash; and anyone else who may need to use or check this kind of information. And always be careful to allow only a few select individuals update this list when necessary. This document is powerful when it is reliable. If not, it&rsquo;s not much more than a coaster for your coffee.</p><p> Looking for more commentary tips?

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NorthernTrust?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Northern Trust Wealth  </u> </a></p><p> Quick tips that can help you when you&rsquo;re looking to buy art.</p><p> <u>  Buying your first significant piece of art </u> ? Here&rsquo;s the information you need to make a smart fiscal decision on a piece you&rsquo;ll enjoy.</p><h3> 1. Purchase Art for the Long Term</h3><p> Find a piece that speaks to you aesthetically and emotionally. Look at your art collection as an investment to be enjoyed, not as a short-term profit. Large gains in value or buying a mega-talent before he or she is discovered can be an exception to the rule.</p><h3> 2. Immerse Yourself in Art</h3><p> The more art you see, the better you&rsquo;ll understand what&rsquo;s out there, what it costs and what you like. Galleries, museums, art fairs, and online publications and magazines are great places to start.</p><h3> 3. Establish a Budget for Art Collecting</h3><p> Decide how much you&rsquo;re prepared to spend before you hit the gallery. Do you want to buy several less expensive works or find a single work to serve as the cornerstone of your collection? Factor in ancillary costs, such as framing, maintenance and insurance.</p><h3> 4. Wait for a Piece of Art You Love</h3><p> You might be anxious to fill that empty space on the wall, but don&rsquo;t rush the process. Wait for a piece of art that truly moves you.</p><h3> 5. Research Before You Buy Art</h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a piece of art, learn everything you can about it and its creator. Ask the gallery or auction house for the provenance of the work, which will tell you the history of the work. Combine that with the artist&rsquo;s history to estimate the long-term value of the piece.</p><h3> 6. Understand the Art Buying Process</h3><p> There are two markets for art: works newly for sale by living artists and works by past artists that are being resold by an auction house or gallery. While galleries take their fee from the seller, auction houses can charge an additional 20 percent to 25 percent buyer&rsquo;s premium.</p><h3> 7. Check the Price Before You Buy</h3><p> Determine a fair price by looking at prices of comparable works by the same artist, which you can obtain from the auction house or gallery or from the online auction records of Christie&rsquo;s, Sotheby&rsquo;s or Phillips. You might find more reasonably priced art at charity auctions and studio tours.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;When I go to meet with a man,&rdquo; wrote President Abraham Lincoln, &ldquo;I spend one-third of my time thinking about what I am going to say, and two-thirds of my time thinking about what he is going to say.&rdquo; Lincoln certainly had a masterful understanding of human character, and an unusual knack for being able to influence others. His quip highlights a major problem with many highly educated professionals: Sometimes, we are so full of our own thoughts and ideas that we have trouble listening to and engaging the other person. The result is that we don&rsquo;t get the most out of our conversations. Here are 19 conversational techniques that will improve your ability to listen to and understand others:</p><h3> Synthesizing:</h3><p> &ldquo;So it seems like there are really three different issues going on here, which are&hellip;&rdquo; Summarizing, which is what many people do, is boring and tedious to the other person. Synthesizing shows you are listening but goes further and adds value through big-picture thinking.</p><h3> Active listening:</h3><p> Interjecting &ldquo;OK, Uh huh, that&rsquo;s right, I see&rdquo; to communicate that you are paying attention.</p><h3> Non-verbal listening:</h3><p> Using your body and eyes to show you are completely focused on the other person. Avoid &ldquo;tells&rdquo; like looking at your watch, letting your eyes wander around the room, and so on.</p><h3> Echoing:</h3><p> Repeating the last word spoken. Client: &ldquo;So as a result, there&rsquo;s very high attrition.&rdquo; You: &ldquo;Attrition.&rdquo; Client: &ldquo;Yes, we think it&rsquo;s well above the industry average. In fact, last year we lost 20% of the sales force.&rdquo; You: &ldquo;20%&rdquo; Client: &ldquo;Well, some of it was uncontrollable attrition like retirements, but&hellip;&rdquo; *</p><h3> Disclosure:</h3><p> &ldquo;I know what you mean&mdash;two years ago I also missed a major family event due to a deadline at work&hellip;&rdquo; Sharing your own experiences, in a non-condescending manner, can create a more intimate and meaningful dialog. If you are interested in the psychology of this, look up the &ldquo;Johari Window,&rdquo; devised by Ingham and Luft . The idea is that mutual disclosure&mdash;not one person talking and the other simply listening&mdash;leads to empathy and understanding.</p><h3> Open-ended questions:</h3><p> &ldquo;What would it take to get alignment around this issue?&rdquo; &ldquo;What have your past experiences been with outside advisors?&rdquo; There is some research which indicates that successful sales executives use more open-ended than closed-ended questions in the sales process.</p><h3> Provocative questions:</h3><p> &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are you in this business?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do you think you need outside help?&rdquo; Last year, I was referred to an expert on newsletter marketing. I called him to explore how I might expand the circulation of Client Loyalty (it&rsquo;s close to 3000 direct subscribers right now, and most of the articles are reprinted in other newsletters, giving them closer to 15,000 or 20,000 readers each month). His first question was, &ldquo;So Andrew, why do you want more subscribers? Maybe you should have fewer.&rdquo; At first I was irritated, but then I realized that I had not completely thought through what my goals for the newsletter were. His provocative question made me think.</p><h3> Provocative or &ldquo;turnaround&rdquo; answers:</h3><p> Client: &ldquo;So what can you do for us?&rdquo; You: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; Client: &ldquo;The CEO is challenging our use of consultants&rdquo; You: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame him.&rdquo;*</p><h3> Questions about the meaning of words:</h3><p> Client: &ldquo;This is a very dysfunctional organization.&rdquo; You: &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;dysfunctional?&rsquo;&rdquo; Client: &ldquo;Basically, we want our relationship managers to up their game and stop playing politics.&rdquo; You: &ldquo;What does &lsquo;playing politics&rsquo; mean in your organization?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t assume you understand exactly what your client means when he or she uses certain terms!</p><h3> Questions about the past:</h3><p> &ldquo;How and when did this start?&rdquo;</p><h3> Questions about the present:</h3><p> &ldquo;What are you doing now to fix this?&rdquo;</p><h3> Questions about the future:</h3><p> &ldquo;If this project succeeds, what would things look like a year from now?&rdquo;</p><h3> Personal questions:</h3><p> &ldquo;What are your own aspirations in the organization?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who have your mentors been?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t kid yourself&mdash;every client gains some personal value from working with us.</p><h3> Questions about feelings:</h3><p> &ldquo;How did you feel about that decision?&rdquo; Usually, we ask about thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Asking about feelings can tap into a whole new aspect of the issue.</p><h3> Use of humor:</h3><p> Appropriate jokes or quips, self-deprecation, &ldquo;break the ice&rdquo; humor, and so on.</p><h3> Not answering:</h3><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know your company well enough to answer that. I can tell you what I&rsquo;ll be looking for, however&rdquo;; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Let me get back to you.&rdquo; Saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; can build, not erode, trust.</p><h3> Questions about the question:</h3><p> &ldquo;Let me make sure I understand your question: Are you asking if it&rsquo;s a good idea or if it&rsquo;s feasible?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious about why you&rsquo;re asking me that&hellip;&rdquo; (Note: be careful not to overuse this latter technique, which can come across as contrived or evasive if used too often or at the wrong moment).</p><h3> Questions about what is missing:</h3><p> &ldquo;Is there anything I haven&rsquo;t asked about that you think is relevant.\"</p><h3> Letting the client answer provocative questions:</h3><p> You don&rsquo;t always have to have the answer! For example: You&rsquo;re presenting to a group of client executives. Someone asks the question, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve demonstrated that our costs are 20% over the benchmark. I just don&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo; You look at the person attentively, let your eyes wander to the other meeting participants, and remain silent for 3-5 seconds. Given the opening (your silence), another executive in the audience may very well jump in: &ldquo;Oh come on, we&rsquo;ve known this for years. That&rsquo;s why our operating margins are so bad.&rdquo; All of a sudden, your clients are having a healthy debate among themselves, and metaphorically you&rsquo;re on the same side of the table. This has happened to me many, many times.</p><p> Try some of these techniques in your conversations with clients&mdash;or with anyone else that matters in your life. They may well help you to have deeper and more interesting discussions.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Many terms in the lexicon of marketing and business are ambiguous at best, misleading at worst. Both old terms like 'proposition' and new ones like  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/is-there-a-big-deal-in-your-big-data/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   'big data'  </a> </u>  seem to bring more smoke than light. But the lack of clarity that has troubled me most in corporate life is the many meanings of 'customer insight' .</p><p> I have come across companies that mean  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/tips-maximising-analytics-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data analytics  </a> </u> , those that mean  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/keeping-up-to-date-with-research-developments/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   consumer research  </a> </u> , some which still mean deeply held beliefs by the marketing leader and only a few which mean something more complete.</p><p> From my experience, genuinely producing customer insights does require the outputs of  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/3-tips-maximising-data-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  data experts </a> , statistical analysts, experienced researchers and commercially minded  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/database-marketing-in-todays-social-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   database marketing analysts  </a> </u> , but it is more than that. Akin to Aristotle's \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" , I see real customer insights as being developed based on a convergence of the above evidence.</p><p> It's always difficult to come to a precise definition which is not too verbose, but a working version for me at the moment is as follows...</p><p> Customer Insights is:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;A non-obvious understanding about your customers, which if acted upon, has the potential to change their behaviour for mutual benefit.\" </strong></p><p> Four aspects of that definition that are worth highlighting:</p><li> \"Non-Obvious\" : Real insights into your customers rarely come from one source (one piece of analytics or one research report), they almost always require digging further. The most successful method of extracting insights that I have found is the approach to  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/breadth-customer-insight/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Holistic Customer Insight that is outlined in this post  </a> </u> .</li><li> \"Acted upon\" : Customer Insight is of no value if it's not acted upon. This is both because to  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/create-culture-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   generate commercial or customer value from insight requires acting on recommendations  </a> </u> , but also because insights are hypotheses until they are tested in the real world with real customers.</li><li> \"Change their behaviour\" : Too much of what passes for insight is just predictions based on assuming that people are creatures of habit &amp; similar people will continue to act as they have in the past. However, real insights touch motivations and are deep enough to provoke a change in behaviour, not just assume people stay in their status quo.</li><li> \"Mutual Benefit\" : In today's Trust Economy and Social World, it is  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/books/do-you-know-which-rules-to-break-or-laws-to-follow/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   foolish short-termism  </a> </u>  to seek to take advantage of your customers for a fast buck. Sustainable profitable growth comes from mutual value sharing enabled by insights that help you really understand customer needs &amp; the jobs they want to get done. <br/>  </li><p> Do you agree with that definition? </p>",

    "link": "how-the-changes-to-social-security-impact-women-and-the-middle-class",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The recent bi-partisan Budget Bill included significant changes which previously permitted filing strategies which allowed married and divorced couples an opportunity to maximize their lifetime benefits from social security. These legislative changes to social security have often been described as \"closing loopholes for the rich\" but, upon closer examination, these changes mostly appear to hurt the middle class and women. As far as I can tell, the rich are still rich and clearly not impacted by these social security changes in any material way.</h3><p> <br/> These special filing strategies were originally introduced into legislation by President Clinton in the \"Senior Citizens Freedom To Work Act of 2000\". They allowed workers a way to receive some benefits, through spousal and ex-spousal filing strategies, while deferring the start of their own benefits to age 70, in order maximize the value of their own benefits. <br/> <br/> These filing strategies were especially important and valuable to middle class workers and women (specifically, wives, ex-wives and widows). This is because it gave these two groups of people an opportunity to collect some benefits while they continued to work (in order to increase their savings for retirement) and also to maximize their own eligible social security benefits by delaying the start of these benefits to as late as age 70. <br/> <br/> Here's an example of what a married couple could have done under the old rules. Let's assume that a married couple reached age 66 together and decided to continue to work until age 70 in order to increase the value of their social security benefit by 32% (an 8% increase per year from age 66-70) by delaying the start of their benefit until age 70. They could have taken advantage of a filing strategy called \"file and suspend\" which allowed one spouse to file for benefits but delay actual receipt of these benefits until age 70.  Since, say the husband, filed and suspended his benefit, his wife would be eligible to collect 50% of the value of his benefit until age 70 by filing a \"restricted application\" for spousal benefits. Once they each turned age 70 they would both start their own benefits, which had increased in value by 32% from age 66-70. <br/> <br/> <strong>  This filing strategy afforded this couple 4 major benefits: </strong> <br/> <br/> 1. It allowed them to maximize their own social security benefits by delaying the start of benefits to age 70. <br/> <br/> 2. It allowed the lower earning spouse (typically the wife, but not always) to receive spousal benefits from age 66-70 while delaying the start of her own benefit to age 70, in order to increase the value of her own benefit. <br/> <br/> 3. It allowed the higher earning spouse (typically the husband) to maximize the \"survivor benefit\" for his wife by delaying the start of his own benefit to age 70, thereby maximizing the value of his benefit which she would receive if he pre-deceased her. <br/> <br/> 4. It allowed them to continue to work and save for retirement while still receiving some social security benefits (i.e. the spousal benefit) from age 66-70. <br/> <br/> Under the new Budget Bill, however, many of these benefits are either severely diminished or eliminated. This is because the \"file and suspend\" option has been eliminated except for a short 6 month window. If you are age 66 or older by May 1, 2016 you may still be eligible for this filing option. In addition, the \"file and restrict\" option has also been eliminated except for individuals who are age 62 or older by December 31, 2015. (If you qualify under either of these deadlines it is imperative that you seek the advice of a social security specialist to determine what you may still be eligible for and to determine your optimal filing strategies before these deadlines pass). <br/> <br/> In summary, other than those eligible to retain benefits under the transition rules, the new rules are most likely to result in a reduction in benefits for spouses (mostly the wife), ex-spouses (mostly the ex-wife), widows and middle class couples (married or divorced) who are, generally speaking, already struggling to meet the challenges of financing what may be a 20-30 retirement. <br/> <br/> With so many other options available to \"fix\" social security, it's perplexing that the impact of these new social security rules on the middle class and women, in particular, were not more thoroughly researched and debated before rushing the new legislation through. \"Closing loopholes for the rich\" may be an attractive \"sound bite\" for some politicians but it doesn't seem to reflect the true impact of the recent legislative changes to social security.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KendraLeeKLA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kendra Lee  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.klagroup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   KLA Group  </u> </a></p><p> Over the years, I&rsquo;ve worked with many sales teams that seemed to view a 20% closing ratio as a bellwether of success. If the team closed 20% of their opportunities in a given month, they patted themselves on the back and celebrated a job well done. If it closed  more  than that, it set off a company-wide celebration.</p><p> I always cringed when I saw that. Here&rsquo;s why: A 20% closing ratio is way too low. In fact, I often find 30% to be a little underwhelming. Just think about how much work sales teams must put into attracting prospects, qualifying opportunities, and nurturing them through the buy cycle. That&rsquo;s a significant investment of time, effort, and money to produce a relatively abysmal win rate.</p><p> So, what is a good closing ratio? In my experience, companies should close 50% or more of the opportunities in their pipeline. But in order to do that, you have to focus on improving two controllable factors:</p><h3> 1. Value Perception</h3><p> Most sales reps believe that if they could discount, they&rsquo;d win more sales. But that&rsquo;s simply not the case. You&rsquo;ll win more sales when prospects can see the value of your offerings. This value perception begins before the sales process ever kicks in &mdash; when prospects engage with your website, blog and social content &mdash; and is reinforced through conversations during the sales process. The language (price vs. investment) and phrases you use (&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll work with you on the price&rdquo;) all reinforce or undermine the value you worked so hard to establish before a prospect entered the sales process.</p><h3> 2. Continuous Sales Qualification</h3><p> When it becomes acceptable to close just one out of every five opportunities, sales reps tend to loosen their qualification standards. As a result, they waste valuable time chasing less-qualified sales prospects. Like value perception, qualification must begin before the sales process by defining your services and who you serve. Sales qualification is then subtly reinforced in your website, blog and social content when you offer examples and testimonials. Your nurturing and lead generation content should &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the customers you believe are most qualified to purchase your services.</p><p> <strong>  The good news? </strong></p><p> Both of those factors can be improved by ensuring that your team consistently executes 11 simple steps throughout the sales process:</p><li> Fully understand the business requirements</li><li> Uncover the business impact of the problem the prospect needs to solve</li><li> Establish a clear path to the decision maker</li><li> Qualify the budget</li><li> Re-qualify the opportunity during every sales call</li><li> Paint a clear picture of how your recommendation will unfold for their company</li><li> Present the proposal in person</li><li> Include a financial justification</li><li> Perform a trial close</li><li> Ask for the order</li><li> Follow up until you get a definitive &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If you focus on the right things before and during the sales process, you&rsquo;ll see your closing ratio climb to 60% or higher.  </strong> Using the checklist above will go a long way toward making that happen and helping you win a greater percentage of each customer&rsquo;s share of wallet, but it&rsquo;s ultimately up to you to influence that change.</p>",

He didn&rsquo;t have the money at that point, he only told me very recently that he had to sell his LWT shares, which if he had held on to, would have been worth tens of millions of pounds,&rdquo; said Birt.</p><p> &ldquo;Then when he clinched the deal, he had another struggle on his hands &ndash; none of the networks wanted to air the interviews.&rdquo;</p><p> The lengths Frost went to get the Nixon interview were phenomenal.</p><p> And Alfred Hitchcock? Just look at what he overcame to produce  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_%281960_film%29\" target=\"_blank\">   Psycho  </a> </u> , now regarded as an historic piece of cinematic art.</p><li> His initial pitch to create a film based on the novel Psycho was rejected by Studio readers at Paramount Pictures.</li><li> Executives at Paramount harshly criticised the idea and wouldn&rsquo;t provide his usual budget. Hitchcock responded by saying he would do it low budget, in black and white, using his own crew.</li><li> Of course, Paramount executives slammed this approach and wouldn&rsquo;t let him use their sound stages. Hitchcock came back by offering to personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International.</li><li> Instead of being paid his usual $250,000 director&rsquo;s fee, he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of the naysayers. <br/>  </li><h3> What do these three stories have in common?</h3><p> <br/> They backed themselves.</p><p> They trusted heir gut instincts.</p><p> They listened to their intuition even when logic may have told them to choose otherwise.</p><p> They did not compromise to cut corners on what they knew was the essence and magic of their dream.</p><p> When almost everyone else had given up on them, they didn&rsquo;t.</p><p> They had the courage of their convictions.</p><p> <strong>  And the rest, as they say, is history. </strong></p><p> So if as a leader, you just  <strong>  know </strong>  something is magical, has legs, and you know this in your bones, take a leaf out these dudes&rsquo; books and back yourself.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t give up.</p><h3> When have you followed through on your instincts, despite rejection, setbacks or backlash?</h3>",

    "content": "<p> Retirement is not just something that applies to seniors. It may not be a priority for people aged 18-34, it is not too early for them to be thinking about it for their future. People in this age group will be living longer, healthier lives. Proper planning is essential if they will be living for 20, 30, or even 40 years of life in retirement. When talking to your adult children about retirement, here are some ideas you may want to share to make the idea of retirement and retirement planning relevant for them now.</p><h3> Retirement has Changed</h3><p> <br/> The retirement rules for young people have changed. Thirty, 40 or 50 years ago, people didn&rsquo;t have to put a much though into retirement planning. Between the company pension and government benefits, cash flow was taken care of, and it was not something that individuals had to take personal responsibility for.</p><p> Then, Canada Savings Bonds (CSBs), Guaranteed Investments , Certificates (GICs) or regular savings accounts could all be counted on to provide a decent rate of interest. Times have changed, and the power of compound interest may not be enough to build your savings for retirement.</p><h3> The Dream of Early Retirement</h3><p> <br/> For many young people, early retirement is a dream. Today&rsquo;s young people are bright, well-educated, and motivated to continue using their talents. Instead of looking at retirement as a time to stop working entirely, they are more likely to be looking forward to a time when they have the financial independence to choose when and how much they will work. For them, a good retirement is about being able to work because they want to, not because they have to.</p><h3> Set a Savings Goal</h3><p> <br/> A standard rule which people have heard is to set aside 10 percent of income for long-term savings. This has always been a favourite number to use. If you can&rsquo;t save 10 percent, then start with a smaller percentage and increase it over time.</p><h3> Start your Retirement Planning Now</h3><p> <br/> The key word here is &ldquo;plan.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a blueprint for having the kind of life you want. The bulk of our retirement income is going to come from our savings, and it&rsquo;s important not to outlive our money. Traditional pensions which were used to fund a large portion of retirement income may not be available, either because an employee hasn&rsquo;t been with a company long enough to make a significant contribution to the fund or because the employer doesn&rsquo;t offer one.</p><p> How much money will you need to retire? It&rsquo;s really a matter of personal choice. You need to think about the following:</p><li> What is the cost of living where you live?</li><li> Will you be debt free in retirement?</li><li> What kind of lifestyle do you want in retirement? <br/>  </li><h3> Talk to a Financial Advisor</h3><p> <br/> The process of planning for retirement may seem daunting, but your adult children don&rsquo;t have to do all the work themselves. There are many choices of savings and investment products available, and a financial advisor or financial planner can answer their questions and get them started on the right track. The sooner they start saving, the more time they will have to reach their retirement goals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/C_R_Concepts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Elin Cherry  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://compliance-risk.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Compliance Risk Concepts  </a> </u></p><p> The OCIE staff of the SEC released a Risk Alert relating to the Outsourcing of Chief Compliance Officers and Compliance Activities.</p><p> Truly, the findings and risks shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise to anyone. My colleagues and I have all recently left &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; Compliance positions to become &ldquo;outsourced compliance advisors.&rdquo; As Consultants that have recently had the opportunity to observe multiple Financial Firms that have utilize outsourced compliance we have spotted many of the issues that the SEC reported. A few things my colleagues and I have noted since leaving our &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; positions:</p><p> Many Financial Institutions may have a false sense of security with respect to their Outsourced Compliance Office as they deem &ldquo;no news&rdquo; to be &ldquo;good news&rdquo;. Prior to hiring a Compliance Consultant, Financial Firms should ask the following questions:</p><li> What is the experience of the individual(s) who will be supporting the Financial Institutions?</li><li> How many other Financial Firms is the Compliance Consultant Supporting?</li><li> Do the individuals have sales and consulting experience or Compliance Experience?</li><li> For individuals with Compliance Experience what type of Firms did they provide Compliance advice to and what were their Compliance responsibilities.</li><li> How many years of Experience do they have?</li><li> Who will be the backup for the Firm&rsquo;s Compliance support and what is the turn-over rate of the Compliance Consultants?</li><li> How often will the Compliance Consultant be on-site?</li><li> How often will the Firm meet with the Compliance Consultant? <br/>  </li><p> Within moments of looking at a Firm&rsquo;s policies and procedures, we can determine which Compliance Consulting Firm wrote the policies and procedures. Most Compliance Consulting Firms have &ldquo;template&rdquo; policies and procedures that they implement in each Financial Institution. And indeed it seems as if most Compliance Consulting Firms implement the entire policies and procedures without tailoring them to the particular Financial Institution. Not being privy to the agreements between the Consultant and Financial Firm, our belief, based on what we have observed, is that the Financial Firm is told they will be tailored. We have not been able to identify the exact cause of why the policies were not tailored, but it seems as if it is a combination of lack of experience, quality or business knowledge of the Consultant implementing the procedures.</p><p> Often times a Compliance Consultant will complete a review by interviewing the Firm&rsquo;s personal and then document the conversation as a report with few to no findings. If the Compliance Consultant hasn&rsquo;t requested specific samples and has left it up to the Firm to determine the Compliance Consultant reviews, the Firm will be at risk. This is especially true when it comes to AML reviews.</p><p> Compliance Consultants may not actually understand the business of the Financial Institution. If a Compliance Consultant does not have the requisite experience in the same type of Financial Firm as the Financial Firm they will be supporting the Firm is at risk to a lack of business knowledge. This is a key point that smaller Financial Firms overlook; it is easy to underestimate the specialization of Compliance Officers and to find that you have hired a Consultant that does not have experience with your particular business.</p><p> What the SEC is asking:  <strong>  Has your Firm hired Compliance in Box and how effective is your appointed Outsourced CCO? </strong>  As the demand for Outsourced Compliance Officers has increased, the field of Qualified Compliance Consultants has shrunk.</p><p> One Compliance Consulting Firm has offered &ldquo;Free 15 Minute Consultations.&rdquo; That suggests that a Firm has 15 minutes to share information and receive recommendations from the Consulting Firm. This hardly seems to be a Consultant looking to for a long-term relationship, or a Consultant that would address the SEC concerns.</p><p> In addition, some Compliance Consulting Firms have a link to the SEC Risk Alert and a statement that their programs address the SEC concerns and however, they offer little to no information on how their programs support the SEC concerns.</p>",

Always have each page numbered so you don&rsquo;t lose your place if the papers get jumbled at the last minute.)</p><p> 3. <strong>  Breathe. </strong></p><p> 4. Your 8th grade gym teacher was right: <strong>  Posture counts! </strong> Stand straight and place your weight evenly over both feet.

You should have <strong>  tested the microphone </strong> in advance, but double check it now. Use your best voice to say, &ldquo;Good morning/afternoon/evening.&rdquo; Do not blow into the mike. Do not tap it.  Do not say &ldquo;Testing, testing, testing&rdquo;. Any doubts about the volume? Simply look to the far back of the audience and ask &ldquo;Is the sound good?&rdquo; (Wise speakers get friendly with the venue&rsquo;s AV person before any presentation.)</p><p> 6. <strong>  Pause </strong> .

In addition, they got free advertising from nearly TV station about the frenzy for the shirts.</p><p> This is a great example of how one company differentiated itself from its competition. Modell&rsquo;s anticipated what their customers would be looking for, and was ready. When I am looking for another sports shirt, who will I look to first?</p><p> While it&rsquo;s not a hard concept to grasp, it is something that can easily be overlooked. Here are some ways to stay on top, and set yourself apart from your competition. And, believe me, every small business has competition of some kind.</p><li> <strong>  Research Google and Amazon regularly to better understand competition and seek opportunities. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Truly understand what it is you are selling, and the extent of what your product or service offers. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Understand why you price your product the way you do in terms of competition, value, and total package, rather than just pricing high or low. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Quality in terms of a subjective general evaluation of things like materials, construction and durability. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Keep up with your inventory, in terms of style, size, color, price distribution and availability. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Create a plan for customer service, including the terms at time of purchase, every possible transaction, product/service warrantees and guarantees, and what the customer can expect after purchase. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Make sure your company is on stable grounds for its future. </strong></li><li> <strong>  All employees should be expert in product and customer service knowledge. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Stay current on your company&rsquo;s reputation, brand image, and what people are saying about you. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Be involved in the advertising plans and make sure to find out how effective the advertising campaign was. Make sure you are reaching your target customer. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> In summary, business differentiation is not a simple planning exercise that gets ignored once you have your ribbon-cutting. Rather it needs to be the backbone of your success in terms of understanding, developing and executing solutions. While a total package is critical, do what you can, when you can, but don&rsquo;t take your eyes off the ball.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Recently I wrote about how Delta Airlines and an employee at the St. Louis airport perfectly handled my dilemma in getting to a speaking engagement on time. There were some  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-care/four-customer-service-lessons-in-turning-chaos-into-harmony/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great lessons in that story  </a> </u> , but there is another lesson that is just as powerful, if not more so.</p><p> My client expected me to show up. They promoted the event and had 200 people that were expecting me to present my customer service presentation. <strong>  What kind of message would I be sending the client and the audience if I failed to show up </strong> &ndash; or at least make somewhat of a heroic effort to do so?</p><p> Basically, because of a mechanical problem on the plane, I was going to miss my connection to speech. Even with contingency planning with back-up flights, it looked I could possibly be a &ldquo;no show.&rdquo; The only solution was a private jet. That cost thousands of dollars, but, <strong>  what is my reputation worth? </strong></p><p> <strong>  If I didn&rsquo;t show up, would the client ever hire me again? Would they tell others in the industry about the speaker who didn&rsquo;t show up? What about the audience members? Would they tell their colleagues? How would this impact my reputation? </strong></p><p> In the future, there may problems that are truly beyond my control that prevent me from getting to a speech on time. That said, the client will know that I will do my very best and exhaust all possibilities to be there.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t have to cost thousands of dollars to save a reputation. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a few dollars? <strong>  I&rsquo;m amazed at how many companies don&rsquo;t think about the consequences of letting their customers down, especially when the situation can be saved by just providing better customer service. </strong></p><p> Maybe a customer tried to return something to a store without a receipt and salesperson wouldn&rsquo;t refund or exchange the item, even though the item was new and it was obvious that it came from that store. Or, maybe a manufacturer left something out of their customer&rsquo;s order and refused to overnight the missing part.</p><p> In both of these examples, the company risks losing the customer, but <strong>  there is even more at stake. </strong> As mentioned in the example with my client, people talk. Maybe the customer will tell their colleagues. Maybe the customer will go &ldquo;social&rdquo; and complain about the company on Twitter, Facebook or some other social media channel.</p><p> Would taking back or exchanging an unused item or spending an extra few dollars to overnight a part to a customer be worth keeping a complaint out of social media? I think so!</p><p> <strong>  So, what&rsquo;s your reputation worth? A potentially tainted reputation that can be saved by providing a little better customer service or spending a few dollars (or sometimes more than a few dollars) may be exactly what not only saves your reputation, but makes your reputation &ndash; a reputation that has your customers talking about how you and your company delivers amazing customer service. </strong></p>",

    "title": "5 World Currencies That Are Closely Tied to Commodities",
    "link": "5-world-currencies-that-are-closely-tied-to-commodities",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> For more than a year now, commodity prices have been under pressure from the strong U.S. dollar and slowing global demand. This has made a huge dent in the balance sheet of many net exporters of resources, in turn weakening their currencies.</p><p> This should come as a shock to no one, but what most people don&rsquo;t realize is just how closely some currencies track certain commodities. When I presented at the International Mining and Resources Conference in Melbourne, Australia, earlier this month, I shared several charts that show this correlation. Many attendees were astounded&mdash;and we&rsquo;re talking professional economists, money managers and CEOs here.</p><p> With that said, I think it&rsquo;s important that you see this correlation as well. Below are five world currencies that have been impacted by lower commodity prices.</p><h3> 1. Australian Dollar</h3><p> Australia now accounts for around a third of global iron ore production, according to the country&rsquo;s budgetary office. This means that its income is very sensitive to price changes. As demand from China, the world&rsquo;s largest consumer of iron ore, has softened, so too has the Australian dollar.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Australian-Dollar-Tracks-Iron-Ore-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Australian Dollar Tracks Iron Ore Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Australian-Dollar-Tracks-Iron-Ore-Prices-10302015.png\"/> </a></p><h3> 2. Canadian Dollar</h3><p> The sixth-largest oil producer in the world is Canada, about a quarter of whose exports is oil. The Conference Board of Canada, a not-for-profit economic research group, estimates that sales for the country&rsquo;s energy sector will recede a sizable 22 percent this year. In Alberta, where revenue from oil sand exports had until recently helped the province become the fastest-growing in Canada, GDP is expected to contract 1 percent. And in September, the country&rsquo;s economy shrank for the second straight quarter. As for the Canadian dollar, it&rsquo;s fallen around 15 percent against the dollar for the one-year period.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Canadian-Dollar-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Canadian Dollar Tracks Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Canadian-Dollar-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015.png\"/> </a></p><h3> 3. Russian Ruble</h3><p> Compared to Canada and Australia, Russia&rsquo;s export mix isn&rsquo;t nearly as diversified: About half of its exports in terms of value are a combination of oil and natural gas. (Russia sits atop the third-largest oil reserves in the world, the number one natural gas reserves.) It should come as no surprise, then, that its currency is highly influenced by Brent oil. Where oil went starting in July 2014, so went the ruble.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Russian-Ruble-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Russian Ruble Tracks Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Russian-Ruble-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015.png\"/> </a></p><h3> 4. Colombian Peso</h3><p> The same story can be found in Colombia, where oil exports are responsible for about 20 percent of government revenue. Officials estimate, however, that oil sales will total $1.1 billion in 2016, compared to $6.7 billion in 2014. With prices lingering just above $41 per barrel, the Colombian peso has retreated 30 percent against the U.S. dollar for the one-year period.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Colombian-Peso-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Colombian Peso tracks Oil Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Colombian-Peso-Tracks-Oil-Prices-10302015.png\"/> </a></p><h3> 5. Peruvian Sol</h3><p> Besides gold, copper is Peru&rsquo;s most important mineral export by value. With around 13 percent of the world&rsquo;s copper reserves, it&rsquo;s the third-largest producer after Chile and China. As such, the Peruvian sol has declined in tandem with the red metal.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Peruvian-Sol-Tracks-Copper-10302015-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"The Peruvian Sol Tracks Copper Prices\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-10-30/COMM-Peruvian-Sol-Tracks-Copper-10302015.png\"/> </a></p>",

Small businesses throughout the country are the lifeblood of our nation&rsquo;s economy. There is a growing trend towards veteran entrepreneurship. Veteran business owners are integral part of America&rsquo;s small business sector. After serving the nation, many veterans return home and choose to start a business. Veteran entrepreneurs are making great contributions to creating new businesses and in turn helping American economy grow.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;The returning warrior may not realize it, but he has acquired an MBA in enduring adversity and a PhD in resourcefulness, tenacity and the capacity for hard work.&rdquo; </strong>  &ndash; Steven Pressfield. The veterans are highly skilled in discipline, leadership and teamwork. The skills derived from military training are unparalleled in civilian life. They have worked hard in high pressure environment to accomplish the missions at all costs. These men and women have the organizational skills, risk-tolerance and leadership abilities to kick start and grow their businesses. The veteran entrepreneurs chase their passion and continue to serve the country by creating employment and spurring the economic growth.</p><p> With over 21 million veterans in America transitioning from military annually, the U.S. small business administration and resource partners are working together and investing in programs and initiatives to empower veterans and their family to bring their business ideas a reality.  The veteran&rsquo;s service organizations, federal agencies, non profits, public and private sector sponsors are working closely to ensure that these aspiring vets have access to funds, counseling and contracting needed to start and grow successful businesses. Entrepreneurial training programs and workshops are launched to support, educate and train the current and future veteran business owners. These offerings can help the vets translate their skills, leadership and experience into successful businesses.</p><p> America owes an immense debt of gratitude to our war heroes. These brave veterans have sacrificed their lives to defend our country and it is our national promise to help veterans transition back into civilian life and the working world. We have the responsibility to help the veterans build their businesses.  Respecting the brave patriots and helping them realize their dreams is the right thing we can do for our vets.</p><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s Salute our Heroes and Work Together to Empower America&rsquo;s Veterans through Entrepreneurship. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> This blog originally appeared on Whittington Consulting's Online Results blog.</p><p> For companies that do business in a localized region, local search engine optimization (SEO) is an important part of establishing an online presence. For some companies, however, this is a difficult and confusing process. Fortunately, we&rsquo;re here to help.</p><p> Read on for some simple tips about how you can boost your local search ranking and get started winning at local SEO.</p><h3> What is Local SEO?</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.searchenginejournal.com/the-definitive-guide-to-local-seo/47319/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Local SEO  </u> </a>  is the process of consciously optimizing your website in order to appear prominently in local search results.

    "content": "<h3> One of the challenges in financial planning is the strong taboo in our society against talking about money. Another powerful taboo is talking about death when someone has a serious illness.</h3><p> <br/> When someone is diagnosed with cancer, for example, the focus is almost always on treatment and recovery. Rarely is there any discussion of what happens if the treatment doesn&rsquo;t work. There seems to be an unspoken belief that if we don&rsquo;t talk about it, it won&rsquo;t happen.</p><p> Not talking about death isn&rsquo;t limited to family and friends, according to <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lifeplanningpartners.com/about-us/who-we-are/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dr. Carol McClanahan, MD, CFP  </a> </u> . In a recent presentation to financial advisors at the Insiders Forum in Phoenix, she pointed out that many doctors shy away from talking about dying until the very end.</p><p> Given this strong reluctance to talk about both money and dying, how can you work with a financial advisor to deal with the financial and emotional issues that go along with a family member's serious illness? Here are some suggestions based on Dr. McClanahan's talk.</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t expect someone facing a serious illness to give you an accurate prognosis of their disease,</h3><p> as they are often in denial. McClanahan suggests turning to \"Dr. Google\" for accurate information. Specifically, she recommends the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov), which has statistics on every disease imaginable.</p><h3> 2. Learn to interpret what doctors say.</h3><p> For example, when a cancer patient is told chemotherapy has a 25% chance of working, the average patient hears \"working\" as \"being cured.\" \"Working\" actually means there is a 25% chance of the tumor shrinking. Often the chances of being cured are far less than 25%, and the physical effects of chemotherapy can be devastating to one&rsquo;s remaining quality of life. McClanahan says, \"Most of what we do to people at the end of life is unnecessary torture.\"</p><h3> 3. Find out early about options for palliative care.</h3><p> This is multidisciplinary care focused on treating the symptoms of treatment, relieving suffering, and improving the quality of life. Because of denial and unwillingness to talk about what happens if they don&rsquo;t get better, many patients never get into palliative care or get into it way too late. Similarly, most patients wait too long to get into hospice care. The average time in hospice care, according to McClanahan, is just 19 days.</p><h3> 4. Share your money concerns with the advisor.</h3><p> McClanahan says that anxiety over having enough money to pay for their care and the resulting effect on the family finances are two of the top concerns patients have. Interestingly, most financial advisors focus instead on whether advance directives, estate documents, and funeral plans are in place.</p><h3> 5. Call the advisor's attention to signs that a person&rsquo;s illness is advancing.</h3><p> These can include a shortened attention span, not remembering details of conversations, word-finding difficulties, inability to multitask, mental fuzziness, and depression. Ask advisors to deal with these symptoms: meet early in the day, address the most important issues first, keep meetings short, include family members as appropriate, and put action items in writing.</p><h3> 6. Realize that sharing your emotions is part of financial planning.</h3><p> Serious illness affects people in many different ways, but the underlying concerns are always emotional. Discuss those concerns with the advisor, and work together to create a comprehensive plan addressing both death and recovery. Remember that, as McClanahan put it, \"preparation for a negative outcome does not reduce the risk of cure.\"</p><p> The role of a financial planner is to help clients prepare for the future, including the end of life. When that future becomes \"now,\" don't hesitate to ask for the planner's emotional support as well as financial advice.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I love tennis. The speed, the technical precision, the nail-biting thrill of a close match.</p><h3> And I admire Roger Federer.</h3><p> <br/> Ranked #3 in the world at age 34, proud dad of 4 kids, winner of a record 17 Grand Slam titles.</p><p> Above all, a class act.</p><p> The question of how we stay motivated, how we stay inspired interests me a lot.</p><p> For an athlete like Roger. For you and me.</p><h3> Roger&rsquo;s answer surprises.</h3><p> <br/> Federer has been a tennis pro for 17 years. It&rsquo;s a life of ceaseless training, ceaseless travel. The surprise? For inspiration, Roger travels some more. Plays exhibitions in remote places in South America, India, other parts of Asia. Covets trips to countries where he&rsquo;s never been.</p><p> To add that twist of fun and magic and freshness, Roger Federer tells Tom Perrotta of the Wall Street Journal (11/11/2015), to everything besides the serious professional tour.</p><p> Nice.</p><p> If, like Roger, you travel for business, more travel may be the last thing you desire. I understand; I have those days when I simply don&rsquo;t wish to board a plane.</p><h3> That&rsquo;s when I need to flip Roger&rsquo;s inspiration switch.</h3><p> <br/> I like fun and magic and freshness. An encounter with the foreign offers this in abundance. Yet most of us shun the foreign with a vengeance, even when we&rsquo;re in a foreign place.</p><p> Maybe you won&rsquo;t dash off on one more trip. But consider the following ways of attracting more foreign inspiration:</p><li> When you&rsquo;re abroad, covet the unfamiliar. <br/>  </li><p> When you travel for work, seek the foreign. Mind you, everything will conspire against this. You will likely stay in a 5-star business hotel. Not foreign. Your very gracious hosts will wine and dine you and offer you the tourist version of their city. Faintly exotic, sanitized, safe. Nice. Not really foreign.</p><p> Inspiration will come when you leave the beaten path. Visit a neighborhood that&rsquo;s not on a tourist map. Catch a movie in a language you don&rsquo;t understand. Walk into a pub not listed in the guide book. Venture beyond.</p><li> When you&rsquo;re at home, covet the unfamiliar. <br/>  </li><p> The foreign, psychologist Blair Glaser reminds me as I interview her for my forthcoming book, is right around the corner.</p><p> Here are some ways in which we court the foreign in our own backyard: Attend a church service or spiritual gathering by a community whose beliefs differ from ours. Visit a social club where folks speak a foreign language. Join a Meet-Up chapter where folks are passionate about a hobby we know nothing about. Go to a concert by a band whose music we never listen to.</p><p> We tend to seek inspiration in the familiar. When we covet the foreign, we court a sense of discomfort and creative dislocation.</p><h3> Our reward? Inspiration that challenges our status quo. Provokes us, propels us forward. Creates momentum.</h3><p> <br/> And momentum is simply the best kind of inspiration.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I don&rsquo;t know why tie downs aren&rsquo;t used more by sales reps selling over the phone.  They serve several crucial functions, including:</h3><p> <br/> Getting confirmation that the point you just made was understood and accepted by your prospect.  This is especially important when selling over the phone as you don&rsquo;t have the physical clues that tell you how it&rsquo;s going.</p><p> Using tie downs is also instrumental in building that all important yes momentum.  If the prospect keeps agreeing with you, then you can feel confident at the end in asking for the sale.</p><p> Tie downs also give your prospect a chance to engage with you &ndash; when you use one, you actually have to wait for them to respond.</p><p> Using tie downs also gives you control over the flow of the call.  Remember, whoever asks a question is in control.</p><p> There are many other value reasons for using tie downs, but let&rsquo;s look at some of the most effective, and go over in what situations they work best:</p><h3> #1: Whenever your prospect asks you a buying question (and any question a prospect asks you is a buying question), after you answer it you must use a tie-down. </h3><p> <br/> Examples:</p><p> If a prospect asks you how much something is, after you give them the price, you can use any of these tie downs:</p><p> &ldquo;How does that price sound?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Is that what you were looking to spend today?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How does that compare with what you are paying now?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Is that within your budget?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great value today, and I&rsquo;d take as many as I could at that price &ndash; how many should I ship you today?&rdquo;  (O.K., that&rsquo;s a close, but I couldn&rsquo;t help myself!  Do you see how tie-downs can lead to a close :--)</p><p> If a prospect asks a question about a feature or a benefit, use any of the following: </p><p> &ldquo;Do you see how that works?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Does that make sense?&rdquo;</p><p> OR, better:</p><p> &ldquo;How would you use that?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Do you understand how that works?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a great benefit &ndash; how about you?&rdquo;</p><p> If a prospect makes a statement that seems negative, use:</p><p> &ldquo;How did you come to that?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Compared to what?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What do you mean exactly?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How does your current vendor handle that?&rdquo;</p><h3> #2 Use tie downs throughout your presentation. </h3><p> <br/> Most sales reps power through their presentations and use far too few tie downs or check-ins.  And when they do, they are usually closed ended which lead their prospect to reveal little.  Use these more open-ended tie downs to engage AND learn crucial buying motives:</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we drive the leads&hellip;.now tell me about how you would get the most out of them?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of our biggest selling points&hellip;.tell me: how would this impact how you&rsquo;re currently doing things?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Do you see how this works?&rdquo; &ndash; And then: &ldquo;How might this work for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Are you with me there?&rdquo; &ndash; And then: &ldquo;What questions do you have?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice feature, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; &ndash; And then: &ldquo;How would that work for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Is this sounding like it might work for you?&rdquo;  (O.K., there I go again!  Do you see how after a few tie downs, it&rsquo;s just natural for you to start closing?)</p><h3> #3: General tie downs are useful at any point of your presentation.  Customize from any of these to fit your product/service:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What do you think of this so far?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Would this location work for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How many locations would this work for?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How many departments would want one of these as well?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty special, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Do you see why this is so popular?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me, would that fit into your budget?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Most people like this &ndash; how does it sound to you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Will that work?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What else do you need to know?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What other area are you interested in?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Would that be a deal killer for you?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Would that be enough for you to move forward with this?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;Tell me: how close are you to wanting to move forward with this?&rdquo;  (There I go once again!)</p><p> Let me reiterate that using tie down&rsquo;s gives you the intel you don&rsquo;t have because you can&rsquo;t see your prospect&rsquo;s reaction (because you&rsquo;re selling over the phone).  Therefore, it&rsquo;s critical for you to begin using more of the above tie downs during every conversation.  Remember, the more you can get your prospect talking, the more you&rsquo;ll learn what it will take to close them&hellip;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Did you know Lloyd&rsquo;s of London estimates cyber attacks cost businesses as much as $400 billion a year?  <u>  <a href=\"http://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-market-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Some forecasts put the figure as high as $500 billion and more  </a> </u> . </p><p> Ever notice the physical security at a bank?</p><p> Additionally, consider the bank&rsquo;s policies for access to the vault. My guess is it&rsquo;s tough for anyone to get in there. In the information age, we can learn from bankers when it comes to security.  </p><p> Just like a bank manager is responsible for the bank&rsquo;s vault, CEOs are accountable for safeguarding their company&rsquo;s data and their network.</p><p> We&rsquo;re all bankers now.</p><p> Here are 7 actions CEOs can take right now to protect their data and their networks: </p><h3> Implement a culture of tight cybersecurity.</h3><p> <br/> Good bank managers consistently emphasize the bank&rsquo;s security policies; CEOs can do the same. In many companies this will represent a true cultural shift and it will be hard. It must begin at the top and must be enforced at every level within the organization.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t take it from me.</p><p> According to  <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/assets/2015-us-cybercrime-survey.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   PriceWaterhouseCoopers&rsquo; July, 2015 report  </u>  , </a>  Key Findings from The 2015 U.S. State of Cybercrime Survey almost half of Boards still view cybersecurity as an IT matter, rather than an enterprise-wide risk issue. The report ends with this ominous warning:</p><p> &ldquo;The time for change is now. Organizations must summon the vision, determination, skills and resources to build a risk-based cybersecurity program that can quickly detect, respond to and limit fast-moving threats. Those that do not risk becoming tomorrow&rsquo;s front page news.&rdquo;</p><h3> Ban USB flash drives.</h3><p> <br/> But isn&rsquo;t this too hard to do? Not really. The Department of Defense has banned them for years. Not only has the DoD banned flash drives; they have alarm systems in place and track and report use violations.</p><p> These ubiquitous devices can carry viruses and other malware. Additionally, because they are easy to conceal and can store huge amounts of data they are great tools for cybercriminals.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve lived without flash drives for the past 7 years and it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine they&rsquo;re still around.</p><h3> Get serious about passwords.</h3><p> <br/> Here are the top seven passwords according to lifehacker:</p><li> <p>  123456 </p></li><li> <p>  password </p></li><li> <p>  12345 </p></li><li> <p>  12345678 </p></li><li> <p>  qwerty </p></li><li> <p>  123456789 </p></li><li> <p>  1234 </p></li><p> Sad.</p><p> Implement a password policy, inspect it, and enforce it. Passwords should be 12 characters, upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. There&rsquo;s a plethora of websites devoted to how to build a strong password and, just as importantly, how to remember them.</p><h3> Re-certify every email account.</h3><p> <br/> Require it be done in person and with a valid ID. Pick a date 30 days from now and lock uncertified accounts after that date. An additional 30 days later, delete uncertified accounts. Simple, and closes avenues of approach from cyber criminals.</p><h3> Implement mandatory information assurance training.</h3><p> <br/> OK, I don&rsquo;t like this one any more than you do, but it works and more importantly it helps establish the culture. Be the first to take the training and mandate your senior executives do the same. Lock accounts of those that don&rsquo;t complete the training in a timely manner.</p><h3> Track and monitor software patch implementation.</h3><p> <br/> Software patches are more than fixing glitches in the software; they&rsquo;re designed to protect you from the latest malware. Get&rsquo;em done.</p><h3> Limit access to your most valuable data.</h3><p> <br/> Make it hard to see. Did Private Manning really need access to hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables? Was it essential Edward Snowden have access to a million classified files? True, history and human nature indicate we may never eliminate the insider threat, but we do have the ability to limit what&rsquo;s taken.</p><p> Implement these policies.</p><p> Today.</p>",

We asked 6 huge names from the sales world to give us their favorite tactics for driving sales productivity. Heed their words of wisdom and consider implementing the following tricks of the trade, shared below. </p><h3> Sales Productivity Advice from 6 Experts</h3><p> <br/> As with our two previous expert-sourced articles, \" <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Cia8dG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Halftime Speeches from Top Sales Coaches  </a> </u> \" and \" <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bWr90H\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Management Pet Peeves of 5 Inside Sales Leaders  </a> </u> ,\" we consulted 6 leading names on their favorite sales productivity tricks of the trade.</p><p> They came through in spades. Here are 6 pieces of sales productivity advice from industry experts. </p><h3> Mike Kunkle - Sales Transformation Leader <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-22-at-7.52.48-AM.png\" width=\"296\"/></p><h3> Mike's Background</h3><p> <br/> One of the foremost thought leaders in sales effectiveness and training,  <u>  Mike Kunkle </u>  is a highly-sought after speaker, coach and advisor to elite sales teams the world over. He has cultivated an amazing body of sales resources that you can find below. </p><h3> Mike's Advice</h3><p> <br/> Individual sales reps sell, but sales force productivity is an organizational issue.  </p><p> Improvements in overall productivity require organizational interventions, which are then implemented, reinforced, and sustained by sales managers, who hold reps accountable at an individual level.  </p><p> Why do I lay this out so specifically?  Because I believed Geary Rummler and Alan Brache, when they wrote, &ldquo;Pit a good performer against a bad system, and the system will win almost every time,&rdquo; and have seen this play out over time in my career, again and again, in organizations where I have worked or consulted. </p><p> If you don&rsquo;t pay attention to organizational systems, processes, and technology, you will not provide the optimal environment in which your people can succeed &ndash; in which you can propel average people (life is a bell curve) to become above-average performers.</p><p> If you want to improve sales force productivity, don&rsquo;t focus on tips and tricks.  Tackle the big issues and ensure that you:</p><li> Have the right people in sales and sales manager roles (and have a proven-effective process for selection and onboarding).</li><li> Are focused on the right target customers and current accounts, in their territories.</li><li> Have a great understanding of the problems you can solve and how you solve them.</li><li> Have a great understanding of the buyer personas who buy from you.</li><li> Establish clear criteria for opportunity determination (the criteria that constitutes a qualified opportunity that&rsquo;s worth pursuing and the likelihood of winning).</li><li> Implement a solid demand gen process that finds the problems you can solve (and preferably buyers with [some] interest in solving them).</li><li> Implement a sales process that aligns to your buyer&rsquo;s buying process (or can adapt to it, because they&rsquo;re not all the same).</li><li> Are focused on buying process exit criteria, or those things each buyer needs to close out the current stage and move forward.</li><li> Employ a sales methodology that helps move opportunities through the pipeline, using your top-producer practices as the internal best practice.</li><li> Use CRM purposefully and track things that that makes sense, based on the above.</li><li> Only use other technologies that support your sales team in determining opportunity and serving your buyers and guiding them through their buying process.</li><li> Develop analytics and reporting that illuminate where opportunities are progressing well and where there may be gaps in results and behaviors.</li><li> Spend as much or more time training your sales managers as you do your sales reps.</li><li> Allow your managers to focus on hiring, training, coaching, development, and managing reps.</li><li> Ask both sales reps and frontline sales managers how you can get out of the &ldquo;Sales Prevention&rdquo; business. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at their answers. Listen.</li><h3> <br/> Jim Obermayer - CEO at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salesleadmgmtassn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SLMA  </a> </u></h3><p> ​</p><h3> ​Jim's Background</h3><p> <br/> As the CEO and Executive Director of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salesleadmgmtassn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sales Lead Management Association  </a> </u> , Jim Obermayer leads one of the largest organizations dedicated to improving sales processes in the world. Jim also hosts SLMA Radio and brings years of consulting experience to both B2B and B2C sales teams. </p><h3> Jim's Advice</h3><p> <br/> Having been a sales manager at various B2B companies, plus an interim sales manager at dozens of companies, there is the one tactic that is always a winner: Sales leads must be followed up until the person buys or dies. This is a tactic often left to the discretion of the individual sales person, which is broken 99% of the time.  </p><p> Research continues to show that only a few percent of all sales leads are ever followed up.  In better than average organizations, sales lead follow-up still only reaches a 25% average.  It takes an extraordinarily educated sales force and management team to hit 80% or better and these are the winners in the market place.</p><p> Research, however, has consistently shown that 45% of all raw inquiries (not even qualified leads) turn into a sale for someone within 12 months.  22-26% will turn into a sale in six months and 10-15% results in a sale for someone within three months.  </p><p> &ldquo;100% follow-up Rule:  Corporations (Salespeople) that have a 100% inquiry follow-up policy will sell more than those that don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p> We know the closing percentage of raw leads. We know follow-up is poor at best for a typical company and its competitors.  </p><p> If you are a sales manager and you insist on a 100% follow-up policy and your competitors are average or less, you will win more deals.  If you are a salesperson, 100% follow-up will place you far above average and you will make quota.</p><p> The CRM systems help in accountability, but unless there is a marketing automation function, follow-up is not what they do; even then follow-up is usually email.  This is why so many telemarketing companies have done well doing what the salespeople should be doing.</p><p> &ldquo;Inquiries rot and die unless they are not followed up.&rdquo;</p><p> Recommendations:</p><li> Determine the percentage of follow-up by your salespeople.</li><li> Initiate a business rule that every lead will be followed-up and a personal contact made.</li><li> Use a marketing automation system to help in the contact and qualification of leads. <br/>  </li><p> Sales will increase in 90-120 days.  </p><h3> Laurie Page - Managing Partner at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bridgegroupinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bridge Group  </a> </u> <br/>  </h3><br /><h3> Laurie's Background</h3><p> <br/> As a Managing Partner with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bridgegroupinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the Bridge Group  </a> </u> , Laurie has spent the last 15 years helping her clients build high performing teams by transforming their sales process methodology, measurement and metric development, project management, and recruiting.</p><p> Laurie has also been voted one of AA-ISP's Top 25 Most Influential People in Inside Sales three times (2011, 2013 and 2014).    </p><h3> Laurie's Advice</h3><p> <br/> Nothing about the sales process is as simple or predictable as it used to be.  </p><p> One of my favorite tactics to drive sales force productivity is to focus on narrowing the gap between your top 15% or 20% of sales folks and the rest of your sales force.  Does it not make more sense to improve the performance of the folks you already have on board, rather than adding additional head count?</p><p> To accomplish this, successful sales organizations are now relying on strong onboarding programs, improved data, analysis, processes, and tools. </p><p> These new tools and processes, such as targeted marketing campaigns, a CRM that matches your company&rsquo;s needs and a quality SDR organization can allow your field and inside reps to zero in on high-potential, qualified segments and leads on a more level playing field.</p><p> Team meetings, targeted training sessions and role-play can be used to leverage the knowledge and skills of you top producers, benefiting your entire sales organization.</p><p> Many companies make the mistake of promoting their top salespeople to management positions, but often the most skilled salespeople don&rsquo;t have the coaching dexterity needed to effectively guide a whole team.  Consider keeping your top producers where they&rsquo;re already successful and make certain they are being compensated like rock stars.</p><p> The bottom line is that to improve overall productivity, you must focus on growing each individual salesperson&rsquo;s output, from top to bottom.</p><h3> Brandon Bruce - COO at  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.cirrusinsight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cirrus Insight  </a> </u> <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"Brandon Bruce\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LYJh5xE.png\"/></p><h3> Brandon's Background</h3><p> <br/> Brandon is co-founder  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cirrusinsight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cirrus Insight  </a> </u> , the 2nd-highest rated sales application of all time on the Salesforce AppExchange.

He once raced his bicycle 508 miles across Death Valley in the Furnace Creek 508 and finished in 35 hours and 7 minutes.</p><h3> Brandon's Advice</h3><p> <br/> My favorite sales productivity tactic at Cirrus Insight is that we send a text message to every employee every time we make a sale.  </p><p> You might think that sending all those text messages would create a lot of buzzing and dinging of mobile phones in the office. And that&rsquo;s part of the fun.</p><p> We started sending text messages when it was just two of us running Cirrus Insight. Today, we have over fifty employees who receive these instant order alerts.  </p><p> Why do we do it?</p><p> Celebration</p><p> Everybody knows that when all the phones in the office go off at the same time that it&rsquo;s time to celebrate.  Whether the sale is for $1,000 or $100,000, the text alerts create a company-wide positive feedback loop.  </p><p> Motivation</p><p> Nothing motivates behavior like positive reinforcement.  A text alert not only announces a new sale, it tells the marketing team, the sales team, and the success team that they all did a good job.  And it tells the engineering team that the product they built was the right fit for the customer.  The real message behind every text alert is: &ldquo;Great job. Let&rsquo;s do it again!&rdquo;</p><p> Transparency</p><p> Real-time sales alerts promote company-wide transparency.  Every employee gets a text message at the same time for every sale.  </p><p> Nobody is left out of the loop.  We&rsquo;re all in it together.</p><p> Coaching</p><p> A text alert for a sale is the perfect coaching opportunity.  What went right?  Can we do anything even better next time?  What did we do to win this sale that we can apply to other opportunities in the future?  </p><p> We all have a tendency to focus on the lost deals, but postmortems on wins are arguably even more important.  We can learn what works and repeat.</p><p> Ready to set up order text alerts for your team?  Just create a listserv (aka email group) consisting of mobile phone email addresses (e.g. 5555551212@txt.att.com).

Explore and list the Benefits (faster/slower, easier/harder, less expensively, gain an advantage, avoid a loss or do something better or more effectively) and the Effects (a.k.a. the corresponding Results your solutions have produced for your clients).</p><p> 2. Tie these Benefits to the corresponding Results (increase or decreases, more or less).</p><p> 3. Then try to quantify (in terms of currency, percentages, number of resources) over a period of time (weeks, months, quarters or years).</p><p> This is the basis of creating a compelling message which, when relayed to a prospect through a communication channel that appeals to them (visual, auditory or kinesthetic/feeling), will cause Attention, Interest, Desire and Action provided the message is produced and delivered correctly.</p><p> The reality is, what prospects care about is: \"What's In It For Me and My Company?\" The fact is, what prospects really want are solutions that produce results. The secret is to tailor and deliver your message in a problem solving or opportunity causing way that will attract the prospect's attention and cause them to act upon it.</p><h3> Chris Young - CEO at  <a href=\"http://www.therainmakergroupinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Rainmaker Group </a> <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-23-at-11.56.22-AM-2.png\" width=\"193\"/></p><h3> Chris's Background</h3><p> <br/> Chris is the founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.therainmakergroupinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Rainmaker Group  </a> </u> .

Without the right talent, nothing else matters.</p><p> Recently a Client called asking how to help take a particular low producer to the next level. They really believed in the salesperson and wanted to save them.</p><p> Unfortunately, my Client&rsquo;s forehead was already flat. They had already tried goal planning, training, activity tracking, and rep rides.</p><p> In reviewing the low producer&rsquo;s assessment results, the problem was clear. The low producer was not &ldquo;wired&rdquo; to sell.</p><p> Despite the best intentions of my Client, their coaching efforts were largely wasted. The best sales coaching in the world is not going to fix broken job fit. It was not a failure on the part of my Client from a coaching perspective. It was a failure in their hiring process. </p><p> Maximizing sales force productivity requires the best salespeople. Low producers must be replaced by high producers. A high producer will typically outsell a low producer by 10-20 times. </p><p> If you have read this far, you intellectually get what I am saying. It makes intuitive sense. But until you emotionally own this costly problem you will do nothing about it. Until you get intimate with the data, you will continue to do what has gotten you to where you are now.</p><p> Get intimate with the data. Assess your salespeople using a valid sales personality test. Identify the characteristics that make each salesperson perform at the level they do.</p><p> Compare each salesperson&rsquo;s assessment results with their activity levels and overall sales performance. Look for patterns. You will find them. </p><p> Until you get &ldquo;data intimate&rdquo; &ndash; you will not reach the next level of sales productivity.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  The Baby Boomer generation bore witness to some of the biggest upheavals since the industrial revolution. </strong> But with more of the Boomers retiring every year, companies are facing the loss of some of their most experienced workers. It&rsquo;s impossible to hold onto everything the retiring employees brought to the company, but smart organizations can hold onto the knowledge of the Boomers through a five-stage strategy that many successful companies employ:</p><h3> 1. Analyze and anticipate retirement patterns.</h3><p> Successful companies conduct track when employees will reach retirement age, and what segments of the company will be affected. For example, it can be helpful to know when senior management positions will come due for retirement, as opposed to skilled technical workers and other key positions. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) has resources which businesses can use in order to assess the retirement demographics in their own company, and thus determine what knowledge and skills they may be faced with losing.</p><h3> 2. Offer compelling alternatives to retirement. </h3><p> Companies that want to retain the knowledge of the Baby Boomers find innovative ways of doing so. This can range to keeping an employee on retainer after they retire to allowing them to move to a part-time or consulting role, as well as setting up forums for aging employees to express their own needs. In the current economic climate, many employees choose to work after their retirement age, so long as they can still take a step back and reduce their responsibility. HR departments in adaptable companies are prepared to consider out-of-the-box solutions for employees who have proven their dedication to the company.</p><h3> 3. Understand potential retirees&rsquo; thoughts at an individual level. </h3><p> Long-time employees are often loyal to the company and willing to work to see it succeed. Successful companies talk to them about their desire to retire and their schedules for doing so. When an employee has a definite end date in mind, the company works with them to determine the best way to transfer their knowledge to others within the organization or the organization itself. HR departments also stay engaged throughout the later years of a potential retiree&rsquo;s employment, keeping apprised of their plans, concerns, and intentions.</p><h3> 4. Transfer skills and knowledge. </h3><p> When a senior employee is bound to retire, the company can work to connect them with an emerging leader for mentorship. Senior employees who don&rsquo;t have specific teaching skills may receive training or other assistance in transferring their skills. Similarly, emerging leaders may receive training or instruction in the history and context of the skills they&rsquo;re to be trained in, and are encouraged to ask questions and delve deeply into the retiree&rsquo;s knowledge &ndash; even when their questions don&rsquo;t seem directly related to the job at hand.</p><h3> 5. Facilitate transfer of knowledge. </h3><p> Wise companies now recognize that knowledge transfer varies from position to position, and from employee to employee. Some employees may teach or learn best in one-on-one mentorship positions, while others may find that working together on intergenerational task groups offers the best opportunity for growth. Still others may want to contribute to a wiki, knowledgebase, or series of screencasts or video tutorials. A company that casts a wide net is likely to be more effective in capturing the knowledge of its retiring Boomers than one that specifies a one-size-fits-all approach to knowledge transfer.</p>",

    "link": "the-valeant-dilemma-how-diversified-is-your-diversification",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Last week yet another firm fell victim to the growing Valeant fallout as Tiger Ratan Capital Fund LP  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-prodigy-takes-a-300-million-hit-1447027806?alg=y\" target=\"_blank\">   fell 33%  </a> </u>  over the past three months, wiping out gains for 2015.</p><p> Those losses stemmed from the fact that Valeant accounted for 20% of TRC&rsquo;s U.S. holdings. But they weren&rsquo;t alone. Many well-respected funds, including the mighty  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/valeant-holder-sequoia-fund-sees-98-9-million-in-outflows\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Sequoia Fund </a> , and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman&rsquo;s  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/25/valeant-bill-ackman-hedge-funds-losses/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pershing Capital </a>  also had extensive exposure to long time Wall Street darling Valeant and suffered losses not only of value &ndash; but of face as well.</p><p> The dramatic losses came as quite a shock to many of the investors who own these &ndash; and other affected &ndash; funds, and who assumed that the funds were diversified &ndash; when in fact they weren&rsquo;t. By going out on a limb and investing too much of their allocation in what has been one of Wall Street&rsquo;s hottest stocks for years, many respected &ldquo;hedge&rdquo; funds experienced huge capital losses that it will take years to recover from.</p><p> In fact, of the 1,000 hedge funds tracked by Symmetric.IO, approximately 12% had a position in Valeant. A startling 32% of Valeant&rsquo;s shares were held by hedge funds.</p><h3> When Diversification isn&rsquo;t Diversification</h3><p> <br/> Having 20% of your portfolio in one stock is a huge risk for anyone. You never know when the next Enron or Worldcom may be and, because of accusations of unorthodox practices, it may very well be Valeant.</p><p> On the other hand, Valeant could still turn out to be a home run and deliver big time. No one really knows, which is why diversification is so key.</p><p> Many investors diversify with ETFs and mutual funds. But how many investors are absolutely certain that the mutual funds they are counting on to provide diversification, are, in fact, properly diversified themselves?</p><h3> When that Hot Stock is Too Much of a Good Thing</h3><p> <br/> When a &ldquo;hot stock&rdquo; or fund keeps climbing, it&rsquo;s tempting to want to jump on the bandwagon, and the same is true for a hot sector. That&rsquo;s no doubt why so many otherwise experienced fund managers over-exposed themselves to Valeant and to the health sector in general.</p><p> But while a portfolio with correlated assets that tend to do well together, is also a portfolio with assets that can tend to do poorly together when the winds shift. As Ben Carlson put it in a recent  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/how-much-diversification-is-necessary/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  blog post </a> : &ldquo;Diversification requires finding the right balance between eliminating unsystematic risk (risk that&rsquo;s specific to single securities or industries) and di-worsification by adding too many overlapping funds.&rdquo;</p><p> Put another way: it&rsquo;s not enough to put your eggs in different baskets, the eggs themselves need to be diversified, some plain, some speckled, and the speckled ones should be speckled in different ways.</p><p> A properly diversified mutual fund or ETF allow you to invest in a sector or a &ldquo;hot stock&rdquo; while mitigating risk. Which is no doubt what the investors who held Tiger, Pershing, and Sequoia thought they were doing.</p><h3> The Moral of the Story</h3><p> <br/> Due diligence. While you and your financial advisor are most likely diversifying your holdings, make sure that your holdings are also diversifying their holdings. Review your mutual funds frequently to make sure that their strategies, risk tolerance, and diversification standards align with yours and that they are not over-weighted chasing impressive returns from a couple of current wall street darlings.</p><p> The jury is still out on Valeant and on the funds that held it. It may in fact recover, although it would have to recover quickly to make up for the loss of momentum for the funds and investors that held it.</p><p> Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s an important lesson for individual investors. A truly diversified portfolio is made up of truly diversified assets.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> A genuine challenge for advice firms right now is how to find the time to deal with clients as well as do all the work necessary to lift standards and improve business systems.</h3><p> <br/> The pressure is constant: the client demands are increasing and relentless, as are the expectations of other external stakeholders such as regulators and suppliers.  The dilemma is every hour or dollar spent with clients is one less for improving the systems and processes &ndash; or vice-versa.</p><p> The only practical way to balance these challenges is to adopt and constantly promote the concept of &ldquo;incremental improvement&rdquo; inside an advice practice.</p><p> Rather than try and tackle the necessary changes in one fell swoop by allocating days (or weeks) or thousands of dollars at a time, tackle it the way the proverbial ants eat elephants:  <strong>  one bite at a time. </strong></p><p> Incremental improvement consists of working on one small piece each day that improves the process, or system.</p><h3> Just one.</h3><p> <br/> For example, instead of spending days re-drafting the template for an advice document perhaps, you would spend 20 minutes getting one part of the template perfect today.  It might be just getting the wording precisely the way you want it for the section where you introduce the &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo;.</p><p> Tomorrow, spend 20 minutes getting the wording right for another piece of the template, such as explaining the basis of the research.</p><p> Apart from being an excellent time management technique where you begin to be able to balance the competing demands of dealing with the urgent and the important (which are not always the same thing of course), it alleviates stress throughout your entire organisation.  Rather than create a sense of &ldquo;big improvements are necessary right now&rdquo; with the potential panic that can arise when people are faced with what seems to be insurmountable challenges, the mindset of &ldquo;incremental improvement&rdquo; introduces a calm and orderly approach that results in a continual sense of achievement and progress.</p><p> The interesting thing in my experience is that when you look back on the changes successfully made in your processes and systems over any given 2 or 3 month period, those little ant-bites add up to an enormous amount.  Serious and significant change can be introduced without significant stress or serious challenge to the running of the practice and the work with clients.</p><p> It is the perfect approach for balancing client-facing time together with the back office work that must be done to provide client documentation, whilst also continually moving the practice forward and developing better systems and processes.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bigger and I&rsquo;m faster. I will always beat you.&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is what Joan Crawford tells her daughter, Christina, in the 1981 movie &lsquo;Mommie Dearest&rsquo; after shamefully beating her in a swimming race. When it comes to your phone you might want to think of your brain as Joan Crawford and yourself as Christina; you can&rsquo;t beat your brain&rsquo;s phone addiction, it will always win.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/xhp0000100\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new study  </a> </u>  has found that every time your phone distracts you with its buzzes and beeps your performance suffers, whether you respond to them or not.</p><p> A related study by Gloria Mark at the University of California-Irvine revealed that at work we are typically able to attend to one task for about three minutes before we are interrupted. They concluded that it takes about 20 minutes for people to return their full focus to the original task at hand. This does not bode well for productivity let alone our sanity.</p><p> Somewhere in the back of our minds we know we should not be beholden to this shiny object of immediate gratification, but there&rsquo;s a fine line between knowing and doing. So why don&rsquo;t we practice the doing more often?</p><h3> 1. The Dopamine Loop.</h3><p> Dopamine makes you crave and desire, seek out and search. The Opioid system makes you feel pleasure. These two systems, the wanting and the liking, work hand in hand with each other to create the productivity zapping cycle known as the dopamine loop. The wanting (dopamine) propels you into action and the liking (opioid) makes you feel satisfied.</p><p> The problem is, your wanting system is more powerful and less satiable than your liking system.</p><p> Every time your phone chimes, dopamine piques your curiosity and starts you seeking. Then you get biologically rewarded for that seeking, which makes you seek even more. Over time, the reward cannot be great enough to satisfy the craving to check your phone to see if you have a new text, email, like, notification or whatever it may be. As with any of life&rsquo;s addictions, this dopamine loop can be significantly more powerful than your human gift of self-control.</p><h3> 2. We are Pavlov&rsquo;s dogs.</h3><p> Dopamine can be triggered simply by the many sounds your phone uses to alert you, or any cue that you&rsquo;ve come to associate with pleasure. You hear your phone ding or buzz and it immediately sets off the reflex to check (dopamine loop). If your phone is incessantly alerting you throughout the day the addiction to keep seeking is heightened.</p><h3> 3. Anticipating &ldquo;The Liking&rdquo; makes it even more difficult to focus.</h3><p> Even thinking about your phone potentially buzzing will distract you from the task at hand. Once the buzz does come through, even if you are self-disciplined enough to keep it at bay, the simple fact that you are aware of something waiting for you is enough distraction to make your performance suffer.</p><h3> 4. Curiosity killed the cat and your focus.</h3><p> Your mind will always pay attention to new stimuli over whatever you are immersed in.</p><p> Gloria Mark explains that our brain has this bias towards novel things. As such, our ability to sustain adequate levels of attention and concentration is easily toppled by anything new. So that ding or buzz we hear (and the association we have to it) works on us the same way a shiny new toy works on a baby. According to Mark, &ldquo;humans will work just as hard to obtain a novel experience as we will to get a meal or a mate.&rdquo; The end game is an ongoing battle between the part of our brain which desires the rewards from staying on task, and our brain&rsquo;s novelty centre, that is continuing to search out the latest updates from our various apps.</p><h3> 5. We seek to minimize pain and maximize pleasure.</h3><p> It was not so long ago that when you left the office you were unreachable. Our ever-demanding and connected world has given rise to the expectation of 24/7 accessibility. We have quickly learned to associate that buzz or beep with urgency and/or importance. Thus, not checking the phone can potentially cause anxiety, for fear our boss or whomever urgently needs to communicate something very important to us.</p><p> As humans, we will do anything to minimize pain (discomfort and anxiety) and maximize pleasure (the dopamine loop). The insatiability of the dopamine loop is sometimes the lesser of two evils.</p><p> Our brains and the addictive qualities of the dopamine loop are tough to counteract. There was a time, however, before the buzzes and dings when we had more self-control (well, some of us). There wasn&rsquo;t the need for families to implement &ldquo;tech free dinners.&rdquo; We made eye contact instead of screen contact. These are all learned behaviors and learned behavior can be unlearned. Just like riding a bike, it can come back.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are a few things you can do to regain self-control: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Set some boundaries: </h3><p> If you don&rsquo;t have to be on 24/7 then don&rsquo;t be on 24/7. If you always respond in the moment then the world expects things from you in the moment. Set some boundaries to shape other people&rsquo;s expectations that you are not accessible 24/7.</p><h3> In case of emergency: </h3><p> Tell the people in your personal and professional life to call if there is an emergency versus text or email. That way you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s necessary to pick up.</p><h3> Re-adjust your settings: </h3><p> When you are working and need to focus, put your phone upside down and turn off the dings, beeps and buzzes on all devices. This is the only way you can stop the dopamine loop. You are not a rat in a cage so stop letting your technology force you to act like one.</p><h3> Check at scheduled times. </h3><p> If you are working on a task, shut everything else off. Start with 5 minutes and build to 10 and so on. Just like training for a marathon, small wins and small goals help you stay on track.</p><h3> Take a tech detox.</h3><p> Just for a day or two. It resets the system and you learn that life goes on without Facebook. You may even find that you can have a great face-to-face conversation again!</p><h3> Get the SelfControl App. </h3><p> This app blocks access to email and certain websites for a pre-determined period of time. Fortunately for us junkies, the block cannot be deactivated until that time expires.</p><p> Do it because you care about other people. Just like second-hand smoke is harmful to those around you, so is second-hand beeping and buzzing. Just hearing a beep or buzz, yours or someone else&rsquo;s, can zap productivity.</p><p> My phone is telling me I have to end this here so good luck. You can overcome this productivity zapper!</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  My coworker hates her job. She keeps complaining to me. I have tried to talk to her about what she could do, but she is not listening.  <br/>      <br/>  My husband keeps threatening to quit his job. He only comments negatively about his job and the people who work with him. I wish he would just do something.  <br/>  <br/>  My friend was having difficulty with her schedule, but she didn&rsquo;t go to her boss to discuss alternatives. She just quit. When I had a problem, my boss adjusted my schedule. My friend&rsquo;s might have been adjusted, too, if she had said something. </strong> <br/> <br/> As these comments from participants in my seminars indicate, tackling problems that affect our work lives can be difficult.  <br/> <br/> When some people become dissatisfied with their work, they do nothing. Perhaps they don&rsquo;t know how to proceed, or maybe they don&rsquo;t believe there is anything they can do to improve the situation. Usually, the only action they take is to whine about their bosses, their colleagues, or the work. </p><p> Unfortunately, complaining doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything &ndash; except having your friends, colleagues and others stay clear of you.</p><p> Some, on the other hand, get so frustrated that they impulsively quit their jobs without having another lined up, or without even a plan for the future.</p><p> Both reactions can affect your career negatively. However, there is an alternative that can help people evaluate their work situations. Answering the following four questions encourages people to take action and decide their next steps. <b>    </b></p><h3> <b>  1. Ask yourself, what is the real issue? </b>   <br/>  </h3><p> It is easy to say, &ldquo;I hate my job,&rdquo; but it is important to identify why. What is the real issue that is causing you to be unhappy? Be honest and be specific. Is it the type of work you do, or just one aspect of the job? Is it the commute, the money, your boss, the people you work with, or any number of other causes? One man I coached liked most of the facets of his job, but wanted to quit because he had to make frequent presentations. Another realized that her new position involved using unfamiliar technology, which made her feel uncomfortable and unqualified.  <b>    </b></p><h3> <b>  2. Can you solve the problem? </b>  </h3><p> <br/> Now that you have identified the issue, is there something that can be done? Is there a realistic solution? If so, what do you have to lose by asking for it? Make the case for your suggestion, including any benefits to your department or to the company. One woman realized that she liked her job, but it was the commute that was driving her crazy. She asked her boss if she could work from home two days a week. Once she assured her boss that her productivity wouldn&rsquo;t be affected, she was successful in having her schedule changed. Remember that if you don&rsquo;t speak up, chances are nothing will change. <b>    </b></p><p> <strong>  Related:   <a href=\"/grow/personal-development/im-sorry-i-just-cant-apologize-anymore/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   I'm Sorry, I Just Can't Apologize Anymore  </a> </strong></p><h3> <b>  3. Are there advantages to this job? </b>   <br/>  </h3><p> If you can&rsquo;t solve the problem, think about what you are gaining from the position.  Don&rsquo;t just quickly say, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Here are four possible things to consider: <i>    </i> <br/> <br/> <i>  - </i> <strong>  -Is the job a stepping stone?  </strong> Will you need the skills you gain from this position to qualify for a job on the next rung of the ladder? One of my early jobs involved working for a horrible boss. Yet I stayed until I had gained the experience I needed, and then I left.   <i>    </i> <br/> <br/> <strong>  --Is there any education or training perk to which you have access?  </strong> Some companies will fund part or all of your ongoing education. This can be a major benefit for many people. <i>    </i> <br/> <br/> <strong>  --Who are you meeting?  </strong> Does the job allow you to interact with people and build your network? If so, it is possible that by having a strong network, additional job opportunities will come your way.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  --Can you learn to manage your boss?  </strong> Learning to work with difficult people is an important skill that almost certainly will be beneficial to you at some point in your career.</p><h3> <b>  4. Is it time to start a job search? </b>   <br/>  </h3><p> Depending on how you answer the above questions, you may decide that it is time to start looking for a new position. You may even decide to change careers. Any number of alternatives may now be available to you. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you just quit your job. Generally, it is best to look for a new job (or career) while you are still working at the old one. Information on conducting a thorough job search can be found in my recent book  <i>  The Communication Clinic: 99 Proven Cures for the Most Common Business Mistakes.   </i>   <br/> <br/> Whether you decide to stay at your current job or to look for a new one, feel good about your choice. You are doing something: You have taken charge of your career.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Investor pitch decks are a lot like first dates.</h3><p> <br/> On a first date, usually you have to do the big things right (look good, smell good) to get the second date. But sometimes, you can still get that second date even if you do the big things wrong. How? By doing enough of the little things (smiling, laughing) right.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the same thing with investors. Your pitch deck might knock it out of the park with a single slide or cumulatively impress enough so that it gets a closer look.</p><p> This might shock you, but investors are regular people. I know, I know&hellip; you thought they were cyborgs driven by pure logic. Actually, no. Like you, they have strong feelings, preferences, and biases. That&rsquo;s what you have to keep in mind while creating your investor pitch deck: it&rsquo;s meant for people.</p><p> <strong>  Take, for example, Shark Tank. Often a pitch that REPELS one Shark will make another one swoon. Crazy, right? </strong> I mean the Sharks are all mega-successful entrepreneurs. You&rsquo;d think all of them would be able to tell the good ideas from the bad &mdash; at the same time. Not so.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s the way it works in real life too. Every investor you pitch is measuring your deck against their mental checklist. Punch enough of their checklist and they&rsquo;ll give you money. Although by no means  <u>  easy </u> , it really is that simple.</p><p> To make punching their checklist easier, I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of the top 71 things investors like to see in a pitch deck, grouped by category. Here goes:</p><h3> Market <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Great Big Market. </strong> In a  <u>  <a href=\"http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great market  </a> </u>  &ndash; a market with lots of real potential customers &mdash; the market pulls product out of the startups. Big markets make investors hot.</li><li> <strong>  Crowded market. </strong> A crowded market usually means there&rsquo;s a lot of money to fight over. Investors love the smell of money.</li><li> <strong>  Dead market. </strong>  Contrarian investors will always entertain a market that conventional wisdom says is  <u>  <a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/07/11/12-things-ive-learned-from-ben-horowitz-about-management-investing-and-business/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   dead  </a> </u> . Be warned, though, all investors like to think of themselves as contrarian.</li><li> <strong>  Important market. </strong> &ldquo;Important markets&rdquo; are highly  <u>  <a href=\"http://diamandis.com/abundance-insider\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   subjective  </a> </u> . To persuade an investor of your market&rsquo;s importance, he or she must first accept  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3052949/vertical-seaweed-gardens-are-the-new-way-to-feed-ourselves-from-the-overfished-oceans?partner=rss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your premise,  </a> </u>  and then the future trend based on that premise.</li><li> <strong>  Changing market. </strong>  Investors like changing markets, particularly when the rate of change is flying under the radar (e.g., the switch from desktops to mobile in 2008).</li><li> <strong>  Right time. </strong> Prove it&rsquo;s the right time to invest. Show your audience that it&rsquo;s not too early or too late to benefit tremendously from the problem your product solves.</li><li> <strong>  Go-to-market strategy. </strong> Demonstrate that you will be able to get your product into customers&rsquo; hands without overspending on distribution.</li><li> <strong>  Sound business model. </strong>  Investors love to see thoughtful, tested  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business models  </a> </u>  in pitch decks. Of course, it helps if you&rsquo;re already profitable, but if that&rsquo;s not the case, a smart business model alone can secure funding.</li><li> <strong>  Marketing channel mastery. </strong> Your investor pitch deck has a better chance of success if you show that you&rsquo;ve been able to lower customer acquisition costs (CAC).</li><li> <strong>  Rabid fan. </strong> Some investors can&rsquo;t get enough of certain markets. They eat, sleep, and breathe it. Your job is to find the investors who feel that way about your market, and pitch them. <br/>  </li><h3> Product <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Unlocks non-consumption. </strong> Many products, particularly software and apps, are used once and forgotten. Investors prefer products that become user habits. Find a way to make your product &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; and they&rsquo;ll throw money at you.</li><li> <strong>  Breakthrough technology. </strong> Breakthrough is an overhyped word, but investors know it when they see it. Point blank: if your product does something revolutionary, some investors will want in.</li><li> <strong>  Changing technology. </strong> Show investors how your product is riding a particular change in technology (e.g., advertisement-free videos).</li><li> <strong>  Defensible IP. </strong> Investors want to protect their money from competitors, lawsuits, and patent trolls. If you make lawsuits a non-issue, they&rsquo;ll feel more confident in your product.</li><li> <strong>  Scalability. </strong>  Your product scales nicely without any drop in quality.</li><li> <strong>  Exclusive partnership(s). </strong> Sometimes two products go together like PB &amp; J. Or 1 + 1 = 5. If you&rsquo;ve built one of those exclusive relationships with another company, investors want to hear about it.</li><li> <strong>  Domain expertise. </strong> Investor ears always prick when the product pitch is related to their domain expertise. Although these investors have higher standards than non-experts, they also end up as  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/13/cybereason-softbank-raise/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stronger advocates  </a>  . </u></li><li> <strong>  Existing MVP.  </strong> Having a MVP to pass around makes your product more &ldquo;real.&rdquo; Investors like what they can touch and feel.</li><li> <strong>  Intuitive. </strong> Investors like products that flow and feel &ldquo;right.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re good if your product makes them say, &ldquo;Wow! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Knowledge. </strong> Investors love entrepreneurs who can rattle off the specs of their product without blinking. Encyclopedic knowledge of the product is what separates real and fake entrepreneurs. <br/>  </li><h3> Pitch Deck <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  The why. </strong> Namely, why the problem you&rsquo;ve identified matters. That&rsquo;s the single most important question your pitch deck has to answer. Yes, your &ldquo;why&rdquo; will have supporting reasons, but boil it down to one concrete sentence. Do that, and you&rsquo;ve made the investment decision easier.</li><li> <strong>  Competition. </strong> Investors expect you to show them your perceived competitors, big or small. Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of listing too many competitors, too few, or avoiding the  <u>  <a href=\"http://nextviewventures.com/blog/startup-competition-slides/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   elephant in the room  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Brevity. </strong> Brevity is not only &ldquo;the soul of wit,&rdquo; according to Shakespeare, it&rsquo;s a pheromone for investors. First, they appreciate entrepreneurs who respect their time. Second, they respect entrepreneurs who prioritize the main points. Keep  <u>  <a href=\"http://pitchenvy.com/pitching/delivering-the-perfect-elevator-pitch-know-your-purpose-and-tell-a-story\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   elevator pitch  </a> </u>  in your mind as you design your deck.</li><li> <strong>  Problem comes first. </strong> Your first slide should focus on the problem you&rsquo;ve established. Start your deck with a Bang! First impressions matter.</li><li> <strong>  Pitch the Problem. </strong>  If the problem is BIG and  <u>  BURNING </u>  enough, investors will overlook a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/PitchDeckCoach/airbnb-first-pitch-deck-editable\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   flawed product  </a> </u> . Which is good, because let&rsquo;s face it&hellip; all products have flaws.</li><li> <strong>  Ruthless editing.  </strong> That is, no filler content. Every slide in your deck should flow into the next one, with no friction. The goal is to establish a strong case for investing in your company.</li><li> <strong>  Clarity. </strong> Every detail in your deck should be objectively clear and unambiguous. In fact, it should read well  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Jason-M.-Lemkin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   without you  </a> </u>  there to present it.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/AIDA.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AIDA  </a> </u>  (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) is a copywriting formula that works well in pitch decks.</li><li> <strong>  CTA. </strong> The call-to-action at the end of your deck has to be LOUD and PROUD. Remember, you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur, bitch!</li><li> <strong>  Customer research. </strong> Your deck demonstrates how customers think about the product you&rsquo;ve identified, based on  <u>  validated learning </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Alternative options. </strong> You show other ways customers solve the problem you&rsquo;ve identified. Investors always ask about <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2013/07/22/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-its-about-smart-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   alternative solutions  </u> </a> . Poking holes in solutions saves them precious time.</li><li> <strong>  USP. </strong> Your product/solution should differ enough from your competitors so that investors get it the first time.</li><li> <strong>  Great analogy. </strong> A great analogy will make your whole deck easier to swallow. Investors prefer not having to think too hard.</li><li> <strong>  Sufficient. </strong> While it&rsquo;s true that investors don&rsquo;t spend a lot of  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/lessons-from-a-study-of-perfect-pitch-decks-vcs-spend-an-average-of-3-minutes-44-seconds-on-them/#.5udsaf:Jsiz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   time  </a> </u>  with most decks, your deck still has to include all the parts: problem, solution, team, metrics. The deck should be long enough to answer the most obvious questions.</li><li> <strong>  Natural. </strong> Your pitch deck should read like an outgrowth of what the company is  <u>  already doing </u> . It should NOT read like a book report for investors.</li><li> <strong>  Bad idea. </strong> The most successful startups in the last twenty years  <u>  looked absurd </u>  on paper. If nobody&rsquo;s exploring what you&rsquo;re doing, it MIGHT prod investors into learning more.</li><li> <strong>  Bullets. </strong> Investors love well-crafted bullet points. The more, the merrier.</li><li> <strong>  Compelling copy. </strong> Words have meaning (duh!). Sharp, crisp writing can sell ideas better than almost anything else.</li><li> <strong>  Emotional story. </strong> Investors who buy into your story through vivid customer pain and testimonials are more likely to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.thepitchclinic.com/investor-pitch/why-your-pitch-must-engage-your-audience%E2%80%99s-emotions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   open their wallets  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Good design. </strong> An uncluttered layout and intuitive design prevents distractions in an investor pitch deck. As Apple has proved, investors can&rsquo;t resist beauty.</li><li> <strong>  Formatting. </strong> The deck is  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.cooleygo.com/7-tips-building-perfect-pitch-deck/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   well-suited  </a> </u>  for the location in which it will be analyzed (email, one-to-one meeting, live presentation).</li><li> <strong>  Questions assumptions. </strong> Investor pitch decks NEED to contain a certain level of unpredictability, surprise, and contrast. Without these elements, investors are quick to tune out, thinking they&rsquo;ve seen/heard it before.</li><li> <strong>  Summary slide rocks. </strong> Like an elevator pitch, a good summation slide will penetrate an investor&rsquo;s natural defense. It will also stay with him or her longer, improving your chances for funding.</li><li> <strong>  Metrics that matter. </strong> Investors judge pitches on metrics and KPIs. Usually there are  <u>  <a href=\"http://leananalyticsbook.com/one-metric-that-matters/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   only a few that matter  </a> </u> ; include them.</li><li> <strong>  Good use of funds. </strong> A good deck will outline specifically where the money raised will go.</li><li> <strong>  Road map. </strong> Although there are no &ldquo;definites&rdquo; with a startup, investors expect to see advanced planning. Include in your pitch deck a one-, three-, or five-year road map.</li><li> <strong>  Command. </strong> Investors like to see presenters who can sell their company with or without a deck in front of them. If your energy is high and  properly dramatic, good things can happen. <br/>  </li><h3> Founder/Team <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Qualifications. </strong> Investors are wondering why you&rsquo;re the person to solve this particular problem. Show them your unique credentials (passion, experience) and you remove some risk.</li><li> <strong>  Determination. </strong> Investors like resourceful founders and team members. Show them (pitch deck or conversation) how you&rsquo;ve overcome obstacles that would&rsquo;ve taken lesser beings out of the game.</li><li> <strong>  Paranoid. </strong> Investors love Andy Grove. If he really said only the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Successories-Paranoid-Andrew-Grove-Startup/dp/B00UNJUM5Q\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   paranoid survive  </a> </u> , then by all means, show a little paranoia.</li><li> <strong>  Confidence. </strong> Although there&rsquo;s speculation about how  <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5885196/the-tech-industrys-asperger-problem-affliction-or-insult\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   anti-social  </u>    </a> startup founders are (and whether that helps them succeed), there&rsquo;s no doubt that presentation skills help raise money. Investors respond to confident pitch presentations (i.e.,  <u>  FOMA </u> ).</li><li> <strong>  Team ties. </strong> The team that&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/252313\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   worked together  </a> </u>  stays together. OK, maybe not, but shared history is a distinct advantage among teams.</li><li> <strong>  Industry junkie. </strong> Building a startup is an all-consuming job. Many founders don&rsquo;t read anything beyond their immediate work, which can be dangerous. If you demonstrate to investors that you stay current with industry news, they&rsquo;ll feel more confident about the company&rsquo;s adaptation.</li><li> <strong>  Megalomania. </strong>  Investors like founders who want to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/Companies/netscape/2009/07/06/id/331336/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   do it all  </a> </u> ; build a massive company and then stick around to run it. (i.e.,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/allison-fass/peter-thiel-mark-zuckerberg-luck-day-facebook-turned-down-billion-dollars.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yahoo&rsquo;s offer to buy Facebook  </a> </u> ).</li><li> <strong>  Thrift. </strong> Investors love bootstrappers&ndash;those that do the most with the least. Show investors that the money they give you will fuel growth and not luxury living.</li><li> <strong>  Great technology team.  </strong> For many investors, the technology team is most important. Highlight your team&rsquo;s awesomeness, and they&rsquo;ll be calculating the days until you&rsquo;re  <a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-m-a-strategies-of-the-top-10-tech-companies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  acquired </a> .</li><li> <strong>  Great sales team. </strong> A hungry sales team makes money. Investors like money.</li><li> <strong>  Great marketing team. </strong> Was Apple or Beats by Dre built on marketing  <u>  <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/02/are-300-headphones-worth-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   alone  </a> </u> ? Some people think so. Investors will gladly partner with you if you&rsquo;ve got similarly talented marketing people.</li><li> <strong>  Credentials. </strong> Investors will be more open to founders and teams with prior startup experience, trophy work experience (e.g., Google, Microsoft), and Ph.D.&rsquo;s. <br/>  </li><h3> Investor Quirks <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Strategy. </strong>  Investors tend to have strong opinions on business strategy. If your strategy fits with theirs (alignment), you&rsquo;ll grab their interest. If the strategy changes (happens a lot in start-ups), everyone needs to buy into that change, understand it, and (of course) be aware of it.  If strategy is not clear,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Auren-Hoffman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   micro-management by the CEO  </a> </u>  (or a few core executives) is necessary.</li><li> <strong>  Already profitable. </strong> Most investors will take less in future profits from an already profitable company than greater future profits from a presently unprofitable company.</li><li> <strong>  Traction. </strong> Real  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2015/05/12/christina-bechhold-minding-your-startup-metrics/\" target=\"_blank\">   traction  </a> </u> , measured either in user growth rate or revenue growth, is irresistible to angel investors and venture capitalists.</li><li> <strong>  Unfair advantage. </strong> Unfair advantages can come in many forms. If you show investors the how and why of yours, they&rsquo;ll want in.</li><li> <strong>  Product/market fit. </strong> This is a debatable term, but some investors are convinced they know it when they see it.</li><li> <strong>  Paying customers. </strong> Don&rsquo;t be fooled by today&rsquo;s unicorns who haven&rsquo;t monetized jack. Investors respect any company with  <u>  paying customers </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Registered users.  </strong> Depending on industry, this is an important metric that investors will use to evaluate you.</li><li> <strong>  Active users. </strong> A high number or percentage of active users bodes well for persuading investors to partner with you.</li><li> <strong>  Big lead. </strong> Eventually, even the best companies face commoditization, but if you&rsquo;re months or years ahead of the competition, investors will perk up.</li><li> <strong>  No exit plan. </strong> Investors like to see founders who believe they&rsquo;re building something so incredibly important that no  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/allison-fass/peter-thiel-mark-zuckerberg-luck-day-facebook-turned-down-billion-dollars.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   amount of money  </a> </u>  would make them sell.</li><li> <strong>  Fits portfolio. </strong> Your pitch has a much better chance of success if it complements an investor&rsquo;s existing portfolio.</li><li> <strong>  Fits thesis.  </strong> Investors, whether angels or VCs, all have reasons for the types of investments they do. If your company happens to match theirs (do your homework), they might invest.</li><li> <strong>  You&rsquo;re teachable. </strong> This is probably more important for angel investors, but still, nobody wants to invest in a know-it-all. Why? Cuz nobody know it all! <br/>  </li><h3> You still with me? Great. If you remember nothing else, remember this:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1) Your pitch deck is a current snapshot of your startup. It&rsquo;s an opportunity for investors to join the ride and help steer the company to a profitable future. Your pitch deck has to sell the dream. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2) Investors are humans. If one investor or group can&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re doing, take your pitch deck elsewhere. You don&rsquo;t need every investor on your team, only the right ones. </strong></p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Jeremy Kirk </u></p><h3> Financial services communicators and marketers would be well served to pay close attention to the happenings at the Financial Planning Association&rsquo;s (FPA&rsquo;s) annual congress, where issues such as fin-tech, digital disruption and the power of integrated marketing for financial advisers are among the many hot topics for discussion.</h3><p> <br/> As 1000 financial planners prepared to descend on Brisbane for the Financial Planning Association&rsquo;s (FPA) annual Congress starting today, fin-tech start-up Map My Plan (MMP) threw down the gauntlet on what it believes the financial planning industry&rsquo;s future focus should be.</p><p> The Sydney-based company released the results of a detailed survey it commissioned into the financial wellbeing of working Australians, which showed that more than a quarter were &ldquo;financially unfit&rdquo;.</p><p> The report, which was backed by Hon. Bernie Ripoll MP, also revealed half of Australia&rsquo;s workforce was worried enough about their financial situation to impair their productivity at work to the tune of a potential $60 billion per year.</p><p> The survey findings were used to develop an Australian first: a  <u>  Financial Fitness Index </u> , that looks exclusively at the situation of working Australians and enables them to compare their own situations or &ldquo;scores&rdquo; with that of peers and others.</p><p> Fast forward to the FPA Congress two days later and discussion on how to serve the vast majority of Australians who did not have funds to invest beyond super and paying off mortgages drew a mixed response from professional planners.</p><p> Some highlighted real issues being able to effectively or sustainably service this sector without sufficient fees to cover the time and costs involved. Others agreed ways to access advice for lower income families needed to be found, even if it put their fees under pressure.</p><p> Views were also divided on whether so-called computer-powered &lsquo;robo advice&rsquo; platforms, <strong>  being developed by the Big Four banks and Macquarie Bank among others </strong> , could help deliver this, or whether it was &ndash; as one Congress presenter postulated &ndash; a potential industry &ldquo;terminator&rdquo;.</p><p> ASIC Chairman Greg Medcraft weighed in on the side or the majority of working Australians this month when he said that automation could reduce the barriers of access to advice by reducing fees and conflicts.</p><h3> The leadership of the FPA has been less worried than many of its members, calling &lsquo;Robo&rsquo; advice a potential means to free up planners to focus on more strategic client work.</h3><p> <br/> However, it was through the surprise appointment today of Dante De Gori as incoming association CEO that the FPA Board has given its strongest indication yet that consumers will be the key additional focus for the Association going forward.</p><p> Mr De Gori is the FPA&rsquo;s General Manager Policy and Conduct and will take over as CEO when current CEO Mark Rantall steps down at the end of February.</p><p> Mr Rantall is a banking and advice industry veteran and has been widely credited with doing the heavy lifting that helped raise adviser education and professional standards and persuaded the Government to enshrine these higher standards in legislation next year.</p><p> During his five-year tenure Mr Rantall managed to help achieve eight of 10 key FPA initiatives and it is likely Mr De Gori&rsquo;s intimate familiarity with and ability to keep the faith on these while achieving the final two that has granted him the leadership nod.</p><p> In his current role Mr De Gori provides organisational continuity and also represents a younger generation of social media and tech-savvy financial advisers, keen put financial planners on the same reputational footing as accountants, lawyers, GPs &ndash; and regarded as equally indispensable.</p><p> While Mr De Gori was reluctant to outline his plans today, with Mr Rantall still in charge, earlier this month he talked about the need to make financial advice more accessible for all consumers and how the Government had been reluctant to address FPA recommendations because of fiscal concerns.</p><p> &ldquo;Making financial advice more accessible could be tackled by making advice fees tax deductible, or offering rebates to assist low to medium income earners to access advice.\"</p><p> &ldquo;With our aging population, more Australians need qualified financial advisers. It should not be just for those who are wealthy; financial advice can and should benefit everyone,&rdquo; he said.</p><p> With internal member reforms largely completed, expect the FPA to pivot its focus to the broader base of Australian consumers, and to removing the barriers that are blocking them from accessing financial advice; barriers such as a lack of trust after industry scandals, cost and importantly, financial literacy.</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "what-is-the-real-mindset-of-millennials-about-banks-and-money",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "There&rsquo;s been a lot of debate about millennials and their likes and dislikes.  I myself cite regular surveys that millennials would rather go to the dentist than<u> v <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/03/the-time-is-ripe-for-disruption-in-banking.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  isit their bank </a></u>, and that surveys of millennials find <u> <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-top-100-brands-for-millennials-a6736421.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  no bank brands </a></u> are desired.  In some ways this gives a false impression, as we have to think that when we refer to this demographic we are now referring to age groups of 20-35.  They may not like banks, but it is interesting to see what they really think about them, rather than what people think they think about them.<h3> For example, I often also bring up the fact that when Deutsche Bank designed their cool new high net worth branch in Berlin, they created the iPod Room for millennials and the Senator Room for their mums and dads. The iPod Room was all white plastic and looked, to me, like the inside of a toilet.  The Senator Room, on the other hand, was all red leather, oak panels and screamed tradition.</h3>So the bank branch opened and all the mums and dads went to the iPod Room. They wanted to still feel young, cool and hip.  Meanwhile, grungy teenage dudes went to hang out in the Senator Room as money is serious, man.  You don&rsquo;t joke about moolah.This is where there are many making falsehoods and suppositions, as the idea that kids who are now young workers don&rsquo;t want branches or advice is not always true.  Think back to when you got your first job, opened your first bank account, brought your first house, considered your first long-term savings investment, thought about the idea of saving for a pension which seems like an eon away &hellip; did you make all those decisions on your own?  You might today, but would you as a young 25 year old version of you have had the gumption to do all these things on an app?  Sure, you might investigate as first ideas, and then ask a few friends or family members, but I&rsquo;m pretty darned sure that for the Average Millennial Joe they&rsquo;re going to get told: &ldquo;best go and see a financial guy&rdquo;, and when they ask who that guy is, they&rsquo;ll be told: &ldquo;start with a bank, I guess, as that&rsquo;s what I did&rdquo;.So now I&rsquo;m making supposition and assumptions, so what&rsquo;s the truth?  Well BAI Research in the USA has produced some fascinating results from a survey they performed this year of over 2,000 US consumers, a quarter (545) of whom were Millennials and split into Young Millennials (57) and Mainstream Millennials (488).And yes, it&rsquo;s true, the recommendation from friends and family is a key factor as to how they choose their bank, along with whether there&rsquo;s a branch near me.In fact, a key surprise of this survey for some may be that Millennials place more importance in having a bank branch nearby than Non-Millennials.Maybe this is because it&rsquo;s where they want advice and, corroborating my view that those early account openings are nervous moments for the youth, the majority are opening their first deposit, savings and mortgage accounts in branch, and this has stayed fairly consistent between Millennials and Non-Millennials.Millennials (green) prefer mobile first bank access with branch falling way down the list to fourth place after internet (desktop/laptop) and ATM.  The older folks (red) like internet first and, intriguingly, branch second, so the old folks out there will keep those branches alive for a while yet.I don&rsquo;t expect it to stay that way, but this is in line with the reasons why the banks are in a major branch consolidation program as, given ten years, the idea of the large branch footprint is nonsensical.  Instead, banks need a Genius Bar style distribution network modelled on the Apple structure of being where most of the consumers are at, namely, shopping malls and airports.  The rest can be remote capture, self-service and pop-up stores.There&rsquo;s a whole raft of other stuff in the research that&rsquo;s worth noting but, for me, this bears out my gut feeling that Millennials are not some new generation who shun the world&rsquo;s traditions.  Rather they are growing up in a world that&rsquo;s tough and want the reassurance that, when it comes to money (which is serious), they will be looked after by firms they trust because they are licenced, not because they are loved.",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Owner Tim Hochstetler grew up in Goshen, Indiana. </strong>  He&rsquo;s a guitarist and composer specializing in jazz, fusion, Latin, rock and classical music. His studies took him west to the University of Oregon and then east to the Berklee School of Music in Boston. Between his junior and senior years, he returned to Indiana to teach guitar. It was then that he knew what he would do.</p><p> After graduation, and with the motivation of having a number of school loans to pay off, Hochstetler got to work teaching classes above T.G. Music. At the time, the music store at street level was owned by Tim Guy Robie. (It&rsquo;s where the T.G. originated.) Robie started the business in 1977 and he found Goshen to be a thriving music scene. By 2004, Hochstetler was able to buy the building. Robie continued to handle all the retail until retirement in 2013. It was then that Hochstetler took over the store as well.</p><p> T.G. Music is known for doing repairs on guitars and amps and it has a wide selection of new and used guitars, drums, pianos, violins and musical accessories.  Hochstetler, who is also a professor at nearby  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.iusb.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Indiana University South Bend  </a> </u> , and his staff teach lessons for all the instruments they sell in the store.  The school features 20 of what Hochstetler says are Michiana's best music teachers, experienced in all styles of music. This includes Grammy Award winner  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-b-gayden-mn0000236715/songs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Johnny B. Gayden  </a> </u>  who has performed with the Staples Singers, Son Seals, Junior Wells and KoKo Taylor, to name a few. He teaches bass to a few dozen students of all ages and different skill levels.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-22-at-10.50.18-AM-2.png\" width=\"645\"/></p><h3> Located in the northern part of Indiana, the population of Goshen is just more than 32,000. Hochstetler says it still feels like a small town.</h3><p> <br/> The historic Main Street hit hard times in the early 2000&rsquo;s. Hochstetler says there were many run down and vacant buildings. Since then, there has been an effort to revitalize the area. From 2004 to 2006, downtown went through what Hochstetler says was a &ldquo;Goshen Renaissance.&rdquo; People bought up old shops and started renovating.</p><p> Hochstetler is still in the process of renovating. After buying the building, he put in an apartment and an office for a massage therapist in the back. He hopes to fix the fa&ccedil;ade in the next year. The building was erected in the 1890&rsquo;s and housed a bank. After the Great Depression, it transformed into a hardware store in the 1930s. The giant bank vault in the basement remained. Hochstetler uses it today to store valuable guitars. &ldquo;Only Tim Robie and I know the combination,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Robie had to originally figure it out by using a stethoscope and listening.&rdquo;</p><p> Customers who stop in to buy an instrument or have something repaired never know who may pop into the store. Members from the band  <a href=\"http://www.moe.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   moe  </u>  . </a>  have come in.  <a href=\"http://www.thebroslandreth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Bros. Landreth  </u>    </a> also stopped by to check out some gear before playing a nearby concert venue. Even actor/director Steve Buscemi has been in while on location for the film, <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385056/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Lonesome Jim.&rdquo;  </a> </u></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"791\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-22-at-10.49.28-AM-2.png\" width=\"641\"/></p><p> Sometimes Hochstetler thinks he would like to come up with a cool jingle for the store, &ldquo;down at 123 Main Street,&rdquo; he sings. &ldquo;Something like the Empire Carpet song.&rdquo; He likes the easy-to-remember address and says he gets a kick out of people who write it down on a piece of paper after he tells them where he is located.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> For many, the most magical time of the year is fast approaching.  One indicator that we are on the cusp of the holidays is the presence of Starbucks&rsquo; seasonal red cups. </h3><p> <br/> The next several weeks are so often a whirlwind of activity with good intentions to stop and connect&hellip;but sometimes few opportunities to actually do so.  Recognizing how often we can feel drained rather than replenished this time of year, how can your business help make this a meaningful season for your customers?</p><p> <strong>  Consider this.  </strong> A woman posts a Starbucks card number with a finite balance on social media, inviting friends and strangers alike to use it for a treat, on her, hoping to spread a little joy after a trying week.  Not surprisingly, people responded in gratitude by posting self-portraits of themselves and their loved ones enjoying drinks in festive red Starbucks cups.  Bearing witness to this story online, another mom did the same thing &ndash; posted a Starbucks card for anyone to use and enjoy or pass along.  She was met with the same flood of Facebook and Instagram expressions of thanks.  Soon after the card balance reached zero she posted a summary of the stories behind the smiles who enjoyed red cups that day.  It wasn&rsquo;t long before someone reloaded the card and, you get the idea, #operationredcup went viral.</p><p> <strong>  Principle 1 in my book  </strong> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071801251/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0071801251&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themichexpe-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Leading the Starbucks Way  </a> </u>  is to savor and elevate.  At its foundation, this means understanding that human experiences are at the heart of your brand.  People can copy your products and your services but seldom can they build the powerful connections with customers that emerge from the well-designed experiences that you deliver.  How does Starbucks do this?  They give customers something that keeps them coming back as the seasons change, kicking their efforts into high gear with the coming of fall and winter.  They do this so successfully and with such consistency that the excitement and anticipation for their holiday red cups and special seasonal beverages is difficult to ignore.  Their exceptionally loyal customers have made these offerings part of their own traditions, marking the passage from one season into the next.</p><p> Had Starbucks not already set the stage to welcome the best hallmarks of the season &ndash; joy, community, connection &ndash; the spontaneous generosity of #operationredcup may not have been as impactful.  Whether it is connecting the design of your physical space to your company&rsquo;s mission, vision and values; streamlining efficiencies to improve the customer experience; or adding sensory elements, successful customer experience enhancements have one unifying component, the need to execute the details. </p><h3> What is your business&rsquo;s red cup?</h3>",

Knowing the way this works, if you want to get clients to REALLY engage with advice, they have to want to.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no good telling people they need advice, they need insurance and or they need to get a financial plan. <strong>  The problem is all the while you&rsquo;re telling them they need to plan for the future, marketers with shinier objects are telling them they need a new car, overseas holiday or any number of other things today. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Telling clients they need advice is like telling an obese person they need to lose weight, or a smoker they need to quit. </strong> It doesn&rsquo;t work because it&rsquo;s not how we&rsquo;re wired.</p><p> Often I&rsquo;ve seen advisers talk through their engagement process, explaining how they show clients the importance of getting their financial house in order. I&rsquo;ve browsed social media to see various experts broadcasting the need for potential clients to get x, or think about y, remember to do z.</p><p> Need, need, need. It&rsquo;s like a kickboxing bout with no punches.</p><p> I believe answer to selling advice to more Australians is to begin by first focusing on what they want.</p><p> Provide them with the info they need without restriction or restraint. Provide direct answers to their most common questions. Get to the heart of what they want to talk about first, and put whatever we have to offer on the back shelf, until we earn the right to introduce it to them.</p><p> Give them what they want. Provide them they information they desire. Solve THEIR most pressing issue. Create value for them first. Make it easy for them to trust that you are really on their side.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re one of those feeling robo advice shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed, you may be missing a key point. That business model will live or die based on simply on the question of whether clients want to use it. If they do, it&rsquo;s here to stay. If not, it&rsquo;ll be gone in the near future. Exactly like your own business.</p><p> If you want to switch over from having a trickle of clients who kinda get what you do and kinda engage with your advice, switch your focus away from what clients might need that you have. Instead, focus all your energy on trying to work out what they want.</p><p> Do they want to travel, or set down roots?</p><p> Do they want a life of excitement, or a peaceful existence?</p><p> Do they crave status and significance, or is it all about family?</p><p> Do they want to retire at 55, or do they see themselves working into their elder years?</p><p> Do they want to protect themselves from bad stuff happening to their family, or would they prefer to have more money in their bank account after payday?</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve got that, and I mean really got that, then you can make a call whether what you can help them get it. If not, say no, even if you&rsquo;ve got what they need.</p><p> If you can infuse this into your marketing as well, so you understand what your clients want and talk about it regularly, freely and skilfully, you WILL get their attention.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t know what it is they want and don&rsquo;t know how to find out, email me and I&rsquo;ll send you a questionnaire that will help you uncover marketing gold in just 10 x fifteen minute chats with your top clients (though only on the proviso you are going to do it and are willing to be kept accountable for doing it).</p><p> If it seems like such a simple tweak, that&rsquo;s because it is. The cold hard reality though is most advisers will never do it and, in failing to do so, will never realise how easy it really is to sell advice to more people.</p><p> Let me set you one challenge off the back of this blog. Start by finding out what YOU want. From your business, your life or your relationships. Not the things you feel you should want (e.g. To take home a good salary and only work 9-to-5), but the things you REALLY want (e.g. To only work 3 days a week and do nothing but see clients).</p><p> Then, when you&rsquo;ve connected with it, go out and start talking to clients, colleagues and other practitioners to find others who also want the same thing. Make notes of the common themes that arise.</p><p> Trust me on this. This small action alone will start you on a path that most don&rsquo;t walk and start a process of changing the way you view marketing your business.</p><p> Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to do any of this. Not unless you want to.</p>",

    "title": "Sales Effectiveness Metrics: Beyond Revenue-to-Rep, Measurements You Need to Take",
    "link": "sales-effectiveness-metrics-beyond-revenue-to-rep-measurements-you-need-to-take",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hirevue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   James O'Brien  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://accelerate.hirevue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Hire Vue  </u> </a></p><p> Data is a driving force in sales, and  <u>  sales effectiveness metrics </u>  are the data that drive successful sales teams to high-revenue results. Key to understanding what your sales force is achieving, however, is a deeper dive into measurements than simply tracking how much revenue each of your reps brings in every quarter. </p><p> The following metrics represent the kind of granular approach that the sales leaders who bring in big numbers tend to take. Incorporating the sales effectiveness measurements below will energize and help you to revise your team-wide strategy, sale by sale.  </p><h3> Quantify how many leads actually lead to conversions.</h3><p> <br/> Start with the basics: divide your team&rsquo;s number of conversions by the number of leads with which they started in a given cycle. Once you have that percentage, you can start to analyze the qualitative differences between sales wins and deals that didn&rsquo;t close. And that, according to experts, can come down to identifying leads that don&rsquo;t represent decision makers in the lifecycle of a deal &mdash; the difference between prospects and suspects. &ldquo;Most salespeople that don&rsquo;t reach the level of success desired, even if they&rsquo;re well qualified, spend too much time with suspects who cannot make the buying decision,&rdquo; said  <u>  Mike Smith </u> , a sales coaching specialist, in an interview. &ldquo;Tracking the number of contacts, that lead to the number of presentations, that lead to the number of quotes &mdash; and then convert to sales &mdash; is the process for success. But only if you are dealing with prospects, not suspects.&rdquo; </p><h3> Track response times for every lead.</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to conversions, response time makes a critical difference. According to the Harvard Business Review, in  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a report on sales performance metrics  </a> </u> , a sales rep is seven times more likely to make meaningful contact with key decision makers when they reached out to them within one hour of the initial query. Sales leaders should query their own data, finding instances of quick turnaround times that align with sales wins. Identifying where the team has lagged and not closed the deal is also a crucial insight. These are the kind of measurements that incentivize change when it come to day-to-day performance.</p><h3> Evaluate every sales win (not all deals are weighted equally).</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to the type of deals we close, pressure to meet the quota can cause reps to reach for the low-hanging fruit. Sales effective metrics that identify your team&rsquo;s average deal size over time allow you to dig into what each sale actually means to your bottom line. As C&oacute;bhan Phillipson points out, at Docurated, &ldquo;If your average deal size is smaller than you would like, take some time to assess your company&rsquo;s lead-generation efforts and why they are producing leads that end up in smaller deals. Liaise with marketing about ways lead generation can be tweaked to boost sales performance.&rdquo;</p><h3> Apply sales effectiveness metrics not just to revenue, but cost of revenue.</h3><p> <br/> Efficient sales teams typically spend less over time to acquire customers and close deals. Tracking customer acquisition costs over time means opening a window onto your spend-to-impact performance. </p><h3> Measure your customer retention rates.</h3><p> <br/> As David Ehrenberg  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2014/06/20/the-seven-startup-metrics-you-must-track/\" target=\"_blank\">   points out at Forbes  </a> </u> , &ldquo;How sticky is your customer base?&rdquo; Retaining clients rewards your team&rsquo;s investment of time and resources necessary to acquire them. While a sales team might see a spike in customer churn at the beginning of a new product cycle, this revolving-door effect is supposed to diminish as reps refine their strategies in the weeks and months that follow. &ldquo;It should descend over time,&rdquo; Ehrenberg writes. &ldquo;If it suddenly spikes or plateaus at a high level, you need to figure out why. The numbers will be your guide.&rdquo;</p><p> Finally, as you explore the sales performance data that your team gathers, don&rsquo;t neglect sources outside your department. </p><p> &ldquo;Sales never exists in isolation,&rdquo; said Marc Prosser, of  <u>  <a href=\"http://fitsmallbusiness.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fit Small Business  </a> </u> , in an interview. &ldquo;In most cases, marketing plays a huge role in lead acquisition. To get the full picture, you need to look at the metrics on both sides and consider how they relate to each other.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, evaluate your company&rsquo;s marketing spend in relation to your sales spend; measure your sales in relation to marketing wins. </p><p> Along the lines we&rsquo;ve just considered, quantitative measurement becomes a tool not only for better understanding your team&rsquo;s performance, but also for building bridges and sharing best practices across all the avenues of outreach. When it comes to customer acquisition and closing deals, sales effectiveness metrics are the kind of data you can&rsquo;t afford to overlook.</p> <p>  </p>",

    "title": "The Path from Wirehouse to Independence: One Step Away…or Maybe Two",
    "link": "the-path-from-wirehouse-to-independence-one-step-awayor-maybe-two",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Many advisors who moved from one major firm to another during the financial crisis now believe that their future is in the independent space, yet are uncertain as to the ideal timing to make this shift.</p><p> Over the past 7 years, the importance of control, service, flexibility and autonomy have become top of mind for advisors. They recognize that the ability to control how they run their business and service their clients, along with flexibility and autonomy, are more attainable in the independent space. While quality advisors more typically possess a fiduciary mindset (regardless of actual regulatory standards), they see an enormous value to clients in being able to access the best of the industry&rsquo;s resources (like shopping the street for the best loan terms or credit cards) and not being limited to their firm&rsquo;s selection of offerings.</p><p> Now that many contracts are nearing completion, those advisors may feel that they&rsquo;re not quite ready to make the jump to independence and are considering an interim move to another wirehouse or a regional firm. Our advice to these advisors is very straightforward:</p><li> The only reason to move again as an employee &ndash; in advance of the ultimate move to independence &ndash; is if you need time to prepare your business for such a change and this cannot be accomplished where you are.</li><li> An interim move for the sole reason of monetizing the business once again is often ill advised.</li><li> A move NOT made for the benefit of clients will be recognized as such by them and ultimately mean a loss of trust. <br/>  </li><p> Given these points, an advisor should consider the following:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;If the business is not yet ready for independence, then why not stay where I am until it is?&rdquo;  </strong></p><p> Staying put is typically the easiest path, except in those cases where an advisor no longer believes that he can continue to grow the business or service clients as he feels he should without making some real change. Some teams need to add partners, build out staff and develop additional expertise before they are truly ready to be independent. Some advisors want to perfect their wealth management, investment management or client service models before they become business owners, and they have serious doubts whether all of this can be achieved at their current firm.</p><p> A move to another wirehouse gives a team the additional time to perform the necessary due diligence on the variety of independent options that exist. There can be a benefit to &ldquo;putting your house in order&rdquo; to ensure a smoother and more successful transition to independence, all while being fully supported by a major firm&rsquo;s management and operational team. In essence, it serves as an &ldquo;incubator period&rdquo;, allowing the advisor to get the business &ldquo;ready for prime time.&rdquo; While it may not be perfect, it may be smarter for some to stick it out until the timing is better to make the transition to independence so that partners, team members and most importantly, clients are not subjected to a move that from the outset is, at best, a temporary measure.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Can a move help me to monetize the business, and at what cost?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Fortunately, there are many other ways to gain access to capital without putting clients through an additional transition. Third-party lending institutions, such Live Oak Bank, offer debt solutions to breakaway advisors. And for those who are comfortable selling some equity, there is no shortage of investors in this space, including Focus Financial Partners, who can provide capital for startup as well as for future needs such as acquisitions.</p><p> For others, moving to another wirehouse, even when the expectation is that it may not be the final stop, could be exactly what clients need in order to be better served and for their advisors to take the business to the next level. The opportunity this creates to recapitalize the business through another deal is just a fortunate byproduct.</p><p> That being said, a move that solves for both sides of the table &ndash; providing you with the time and money you need to prepare for an independent practice as well as a better experience for your clients &ndash; is certainly worth considering, provided you are ready to take two steps instead of one.</p>",

    "title": "Fishing for Sales: Your Marketing May Not Be Enough",
    "link": "fishing-for-sales-your-marketing-may-not-be-enough",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Marketing is a lot like fishing.</h3><p> <br/> Antonio gets up at 2am every morning to head out into the sea, off the coast of Vernazza, a beautiful fishing village in Italy. He takes his boat out about 20 minutes further than the other fishermen. He knows just the right spot to fish each morning. Antonio sifts through his collection of nets, looking for the perfect one for the conditions that day. He throws his nets out and sits in the stillness of the dark early morning casting several lines off the side of the boat as well, each with different lures and bait. His work pays off.  By 5am his nets are full and each pole has pulled in its share of beautiful fish. He heads back in to get his fish to market. Fishing is his life. He unloads all the fish but two, which he brings home in a brown paper sack for his wife Louise to cook for dinner.</p><p> At the market, every restaurant in the area has someone there to grab the fresh catch and bring them back for their daily menus. Some chefs would not send someone else to make such an important selection while others have their shoppers out gathering everything for them. </p><p> Now, why do some restaurants thrive and have waiting lists for hours each night, while others struggle to keep their doors open? Of course it&rsquo;s the way the food is prepared. It&rsquo;s how people are treated when they dine at each spot. There are many factors that come into play, even if they all start with the same fish. </p><p> Marketing is like fishing. You can catch the attention of thousands and even drive them right to the door of your website, but if people don&rsquo;t like what they experience once they get there, they move on down to the next spot.  </p><p> You might be frustrated trying every marketing tactic in the book. You see your traffic increasing. You have more people liking and following your content (like chum) but the sales still aren&rsquo;t happening. It might be time to evaluate what you are actually offering.</p><li> <strong>  Do you have a product or service that people are still wanting? If you are trying to sell a software that works on a home computer allowing kids to check in when they get home and let their parents know they are safe, you might be overlooking the fact that 10-year-olds have iPhones and can simply Facetime Mom and Dad. You might love your home computer but not understand that many families see the home computer as outdated, instead using apps on tablets and phones. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do you have a product or service with a price point that is too high for the audience you have attracted? You might have a quality product, but the audience you&rsquo;re selling it to has no budget to spend on such items. Is there another audience you need to attract or do you need to retool the product to bring the price down? Your marketing may be attractive to your audience, but they&rsquo;re just window shopping and drooling all over the merchandise. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Is someone else offering your product or service in a way that is easier for people to access or consume? Taxi companies thought their competition was other taxi companies until Uber came and took a huge bite out of their business. Walmart or Target offer great deals and yet Amazon keeps finding ways to get that same merchandise to consumers faster and free.  </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do you have a message that you think the world needs and yet you forgot to check with the world to see if they feel the same way? Sometimes we fall so in love with our own messaging that we are blinded to the fact that no one else has.  </strong></li><li> <strong>  We have seen several companies lured (had to work that pun in here somewhere) into this thinking. They keep throwing more money to marketing, thinking if we can just get more people to know about them, they will be successful. Perhaps the business needs to retool, rethink and realign with what consumers are looking for.  </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Keep your eyes on that horizon and see how consumers are behaving.

    "content": "<p> Digging yourself out of debt&mdash;successfully&mdash;starts with a  <u>  mindset shift </u> . The kind of permanent rethink that prevents you from making that same mistake again.</p><p> No shift, more debt.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s a technique to get your mindset headed in a new direction:  visualization. Before you scoff, hear me out. </p><p> We all visualize&mdash;and often. We just tend to focus on the negative.</p><p> We imagine how much happiness we&rsquo;ll have from buying that big flat screen TV&mdash;but we don&rsquo;t visualize how we&rsquo;ll feel when the credit card bill arrives. We see a luscious dessert and imagine a happy feast, not the inches added to our waist.</p><p> But supportive visualizations help you create a compelling reason to do something meaningful.</p><p> Take a moment to think of one action related to your finances that would have a positive impact on your life. Write it down as a positive statement, such as &ldquo;I will pay off my credit card debt and maintain a zero balance on a monthly basis.&rdquo;</p><p> Once you have your statement, answer these questions:</p><li> <strong>  Why is this important to me? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Who is affected by my decision? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How does my decision improve their lives? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How will I feel when I accomplish my goal? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What steps do I need to take to make it happen? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What is stopping me from achieving this goal? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Need a little inspiration? The couple I talked about last week (who eventually paid off every dime and kept it off) answered like this:</p><li> Why is this important to me? <br/> If I have no debt then I am saving money instead of blowing it all on high interest credit cards. I won&rsquo;t have to worry about debt hanging over my head and I will have more resources to do the things that make me feel financially safe and secure&mdash;and happy!</li><li> Who is affected by my decision? <br/> My family is affected by my financial distress that&rsquo;s caused by this debt. I devote more time to worrying than I do enjoying my family and my life.</li><li> How does my decision improve their lives? <br/> When I am debt free, my family will be more secure financially and therefore more prepared for unforeseen occurrences.</li><li> How will I feel when I accomplish my goal? <br/> I will feel relieved and proud of myself.</li><li> What steps do I need to take in order to make it happen? <br/> First, I need to assemble all my debt, list the balances, due dates, interest rates, etc. Then I need to contact each company and see if they will decrease my rates. If not, I will look to transfer to a better deal. Meanwhile, I will look at my spending and cut back on my non-fixed costs. The money I save will be used to accelerate my payments, starting with the highest rate card first.</li><li> What is stopping me from achieving this goal? <br/> Only my beliefs are stopping me. I must believe that it is doable and not impossible. I must be disciplined, patient and know that I am doing this for my peace of mind and the safety of my family. <br/>  </li><p> After three years of focus, discipline and patience, my clients came in with zero balances on their credit card statements. They felt powerful, successful and hopeful.</p><p> The road was not without bumps&mdash;there were challenges and slips and feeling deprived of some of the small comforts and frills that had become a part of their lives.</p><p> But throughout their experience, they kept coming back to their visualization and their reasons for wanting to get themselves out of debt. In the end, they realized that even the hardest moments of attaining this goal were easier than being hopelessly mired in debt.</p><p> So give visualization a try&mdash;and start digging out.</p>",

    "link": "how-better-communication-brings-more-sales",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> You can have the best products at the most competitive prices, the flashiest advertising campaigns, and the glitziest premises in town. You may even be enjoying a spike in sales. But the only way to win repeat business, accumulate a legion of loyal customers, enjoy stellar word of mouth and, most importantly, create a pattern of continuous sales growth is to build a long-term relationship with your clientele. And this means mastering the art of communication excellence. <br/> <br/> Becoming your industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;top dog&rdquo; requires attention to communication.</p><p> <strong>  Develop Your Listening Skills </strong></p><p> The squeaky wheel may get the grease, but, sometimes, it gets replaced. After all, constant noise is annoying. That&rsquo;s why it is important to use your ears more than your mouth. Yes, that means listening when your client is speaking&ndash;and not, simply, using this time to formulate what you are going to say next.</p><p> By actively listening to your customers you will be rewarded with greater sales success. After all, as &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://pdhcontractors.com/uncategorized/how-better-client-communication-can-make-you-a-better-and-busier-contractor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How Better Client Communication Can Make You a Better (And Busier) Contractor  </a> </u> &rdquo; advises, the client&rsquo;s vision matters more than yours and through effective communication, you can gain a more well-rounded understanding of what they want. By accurately identifying their needs and finding a way to meet them, you will not only cement the deal, but you will likely win repeat business and glowing referrals.</p><p> <strong>  Use The Client&rsquo;s Language </strong></p><p> An important rule of communication is to meet their client&rsquo;s where they are. If your customer is not knowledgeable about your industry or products, do not drown them in &ldquo;tech-speak&rdquo; and jargon. Instead, in plain English, explain how your product&rsquo;s features will meet their needs.</p><p> It is also wise to pay attention to your client&rsquo;s choice of words. This will better enable you to explain concepts using their own language&ndash;increasing understanding and building a better rapport. <br/> <br/> By actively listening and using the customer&rsquo;s language, you will be better able to avoid miscommunication.</p><p> <strong>  Master the Details </strong></p><p> As you well know, communication is about much more than the spoken word. Non-verbal cues also play a vital role in conveying information.</p><p> Obviously, making eye contact with the person to whom you are speaking will prevent confusion. But, as Intuit&rsquo;s &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/marketing/5-tips-for-communicating-well-and-increasing-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 Tips for Communicating Well  </a> </u> &rdquo; adds, by just making eye contact with your listener, you&rsquo;ll also convey trustworthiness, confidence, and likability&ndash;all necessary ingredients when creating a lasting customer relationship.</p><p> You will also want to avoid invading your client&rsquo;s personal space. Fans of Seinfeld will remember the &ldquo;close talker,&rdquo; Elaine&rsquo;s boyfriend who regularly encroached on people&rsquo;s personal space, causing a myriad of entertaining&ndash;but not conducive to sales&ndash;reactions. According to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/people-places-and-things/201406/personal-space-the-beach\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Psychology Today  </a> </u> , the space for an intimate conversation is less than 1 1/2 feet, a personal conversation is 1 1/2 to 4 feet, a social interaction is 4 to 12 feet, and over 12 feet is required for a public discussion.</p><p> <strong>  Strive for Succinct </strong></p><p> No matter how excited you are about your product, it is important to reign yourself in. Resist the urge to talk excessively, speak quickly, or use increased volume to emphasize important points. &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/3-smart-ways-to-keep-yourself-from-rambling\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   3 Ways to Keep Yourself from Rambling  </a> </u> &rdquo; recommends adopting a the &ldquo;low and slow&rdquo; approach used by law students&ndash; lowering your voice and slowing down your tempo in order to signal that what you are about to say is important and needs to be retained. This will keep your clients interested and help you to highlight the information that you want them to focus on. <br/> <br/> &ldquo;Go ahead. I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo;</p><p> When it comes to excelling in sales, those with superior communication skills have a competitive edge. So open those ears, look into their eyes&ndash;from a respectable distance, of course&ndash;and choose your words with care. Your relationship with your customers&ndash;and your sales success&ndash;depends on it.</p><p> <strong>  In your opinion, what is the biggest communications &ldquo;no-no?&rdquo; Why? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Too many of us fight sleep, not wanting to miss anything. Unfortunately, as with most things in life, there are consequences when you don&rsquo;t get enough sleep. Here are eight health reasons why you should turn off the light (and the TV and tablet) earlier tonight:</p><h3> 1. Your immune system will work better. </h3><p> We know that sleep is necessary for a normal functioning immune system. Numerous studies have shown that our immune system works best when we get adequate sleep. In fact, several studies have demonstrated poor responses to vaccines for influenza and hepatitis when subjects were sleep deprived.</p><h3> 2. Your memory will improve, and your golf game may be better. </h3><p> It has been fully demonstrated that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25201480\" target=\"_blank\">   sleep is necessary for memory consolidation  </a> </u> . Actually, when research subjects got a good night&rsquo;s sleep after learning new information, they performed much better on testing than those who did not sleep. This pertains to factual memory (also referred to as declarative memory), as well as procedural memory, such as learning to ride a bike or swing a golf club.</p><h3> 3. You&rsquo;ll feel better emotionally. </h3><p> We know that chronically sleep-deprived people have a much higher incidence of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/robert-rosenberg-sleep-answers/sleep-and-mental-illness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   anxiety disorders and depression  </a> </u> . This is probably due to sleep&rsquo;s critical role in emotional processing, which appears to mainly take place during  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/nine-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-dreaming/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   REM (dream sleep)  </a> </u>  but is by no means confined only to this stage of sleep.</p><h3> 4. Your brain will be &ldquo;cleaner.&rdquo; </h3><p> As I point out in my book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Soundly-Every-Night-Fantastic-ebook/dp/B00KVEI18S/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sleep Soundly Every Night, Feel Fantastic Every Day  </a> </u> , it is during sleep that our brain performs several regenerative processes. The brain&rsquo;s neuroplasticity &ndash; the ability to from new pathways and connections &ndash; is very much sleep dependent. Additionally, housekeeping chores, such as clearing out various neurotoxins that build up in the brain during the day, occur at a rate ten times greater during sleep.</p><h3> 5. You&rsquo;ll help repair and grow new tissue. </h3><p> It is during sleep that we produce most of our growth hormone. In fact, this production is most closely linked to deep or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/experts-how-does-aging-affect-sleep-cycles.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   slow-wave sleep  </a> </u> . In children, this is intimately linked with their growth. In adults, it is very important in tissue repair. If you are a body builder or an athlete, it is crucial to get enough sleep to allow your musculoskeletal system to restore itself.</p><h3> 6. You&rsquo;ll help stabilize your blood sugar level. </h3><p> We know that sleep-deprived people have a higher incidence of diabetes. This is because sleep deprivation leads to  <u>  insulin resistance </u> . As a result, insulin is unable to get into cells and exert its influence. In recent papers, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2011/may/the-role-of-sleep-in-type-2-diabetes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Diabetes Association  </a> </u>  has been stressing the importance of sleep in preventing and treating diabetes.</p><h3> 7. You just may lose weight. </h3><p> Want to reduce that waistline? Get seven to eight hours of sleep. Insufficient sleep leads to excessive production of a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin is an appetite-promoting hormone. It also impedes the production of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/DietNutrition/18026\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   leptin, an appetite-suppressing hormone  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 8. You may live longer. </h3><p> Study after study has shown that those of us who chronically sleep less than seven hours a night do not live as long. We are far more likely to develop high blood pressure, strokes, and heart attacks. As a result, we have a shorter lifespan.</p><p> All of these reasons add up to one thing:  <strong>  We need to make sleep a priority. </strong> Unfortunately, some consider sleep to be a waste of time. Just the opposite is true. Sleep is critical for your emotional and physical well-being, and there is no substitute. <strong>  Get more sleep, starting now. </strong></p>",

Take a look at a few samples in this  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/seniors/freelunchreport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC report on pages 29-42  </a> </u> .</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20151013/FREE/151019971/regulators-target-free-lunches-for-elderly-clientele\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   InvestmentNews  </a> </u>  recently published an article describing how the SEC has now found a &ldquo;strong correlation&rdquo; between free lunch seminars and selling high commission based products.</p><p> After conducting more than 100 examinations of the free-meal seminars, the SEC, FINRA and state regulators are now cracking down on fraudulent selling practices being used.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolynrosenblatt/2015/02/02/stealth-the-free-lunch-investment-seminar/\" target=\"_blank\">   Half of these cases  </a> </u> , found exaggerated claims in the offers being pitched.</p><p> One of the newer concerns for regulators are the embellished credentials used by presenters.

    "content": "<p> Managing change is like a Formula 1 race. To the person in the driver&rsquo;s seat, goals remain distant even when the pedal&rsquo;s on the metal. But to the spectators, the acceleration is violent.</p><h3> Change is Subjective</h3><p> <br/> In the laboratories, innovations take years to move from the drawing board into the market. The detail, the peer review process and the criteria for sound empirical progress make it slow. But entrepreneurs mostly notice the innovations that already crossed over and went viral in their niche. To them, it seems as if everything changes faster and faster.</p><p> On average, new technology takes 20 years to reach a market of substance. It did twenty years ago, and it does now. However, the number of inventions and innovations is growing exponentially. More and more innovations have reached the market almost simultaneously, and even more will arrive in the future. It&rsquo;s the sheer number of innovations that&rsquo;s fooling us. It&rsquo;s not the speed of change.</p><p> At the races, you experience speed when the race car is driving in front of you. The moment is gone in a second, bringing fleeting sensations or roaring winds, screeching tires, burning rubber, and heat. In contrast, you&rsquo;ve seen the car approaching for some time, and then you watch it slowly disappear in the distance.</p><p> Market disruption is like that brief passing moment. There&rsquo;s a complete process preceding and following it. The role of Futurism isn&rsquo;t to predict what follows. It&rsquo;s to find early warnings in the process before the disruption. Like finding the first moment the race car drives into vision. [inlinetweet prefix=&rdquo;&rdquo; tweeter=&rdquo;@barstweets&rdquo; suffix=&rdquo;#future #disruption&rdquo;][/inlinetweet]Futurism is tracing the trajectory of possible disruption backwards.</p><p> The early signals of change are waiting for us in the laboratories. If we meet change there, we&rsquo;ve created time to bring our business up to speed, before the wave of disruption hits. The slow progress in the labs grants us time to prepare.</p><h3> Market Change is Situational</h3><p> <br/> Contrary to the race track, it&rsquo;s not just racers and spectators on the streets and roads. Other participants join the traffic there too. Pedestrians, cyclists, car lovers and haters, people of various ages and abilities, with dogs and bags and cellphone conversations. Each of them has a different perception of the speed of the race car, depending on their relative position, speed, experience, and attitude towards speed. Because the whole system is moving, relative change rates do change.</p><p> When your business is tech savvy, you&rsquo;ll have a different perception of change than laggard competitors have. While when your customers are geeks, they may think you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s lagging behind. Change rate isn&rsquo;t objective, it&rsquo;s a perception, that depends on your unique situation. Therefore, the only one who knows the rate of change impacting your business is you.</p><h3> Calculating the Change Rate in Your Situation</h3><p> <br/> You probably review management information periodically: profit, loss, ROI, churn, the sales funnel, and so on. If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re also interpreting market trends: the percentages of new entrants, bankruptcies, takeovers, joint ventures, new customer behaviors, and preferences. Those are the factors that also underlie the calculation of your perception of change.</p><p> Just list those factors you usually consider, include trends and developments, and answer two questions:</p><li> How often did a factor change in value in the last three years?</li><li> How often haven you take new and different factors into consideration during the same period? <br/>  </li><p> A rough count is enough. Here is how you interpret your answers:</p><br /><li> If more than 50% of the elements hardly change at all, you&rsquo;re in a static situation</li><li> If more than 50% of the factors change little, but you have to consider new and other factors each time you&rsquo;re making this decision, the situation is dynamic, but still rather predictable and manageable</li><li> If more than 50% of the factors change very often: dynamic and surprising</li><li> If more than 50% of the factors change very often, AND you have to consider new and other factors each time you&rsquo;re making this decision, the situation is turbulent <br/>  </li><h3> Change Rate and Strategy</h3><p> <br/> Each cell of the matrix has its strategic counterpart. In stable, static markets, competitive advantage flows from positioning, scale, and aptitude in making or delivering an offering. In other words, you must be really good at doing some particular thing.</p><p> In dynamic markets, companies must be superb at learning how to do new things. You have to experiment rapidly, frequently, and economically&mdash;not only with products and services but also with business models, processes, and strategies.</p><p> Alternative strategic paths, showing switch moments and endings of effect</p><p> Finally, in turbulent markets, a policy framework is advisable.</p><p> It takes several alternate strategies, that &mdash;depending on the changes in question, stop or begin to be effective. Preparing for all policies and monitoring tipping points carefully, allows companies to keep up and profit from turbulence.</p><p> Turbulence isn&rsquo;t to be feared or detested. It&rsquo;s a chance to realign the business and make it better. Burning platforms make change easier to implement, but the course is harder to set. I hope that this post has helped a bit to put change rates into perspective.</p>",

    "title": "Advisors: Writing for the Web Creates 4 Marketing Benefits",
    "link": "advisors-writing-for-the-web-creates-4-marketing-benefits",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Susan K. Becker</p><p> How can writing for the web enrich your financial advisory business? A financial advisor who publishes a newsletter gets a call: &ldquo;Your friend just sent me a link from your newsletter. My wife is planning to retire, and we want to make the best use of those assets, consistent with our family goals. Can we all get together?&rdquo;</p><p> This story shows several marketing dynamics specific to the web: Easy broadened distribution that can create unexpected business leads; web analytics that enable the advisor to see which newsletter stories were clicked and any that were clicked multiple times; and an additional information source when preparing for meetings. Because newsletter links drove traffic to the advisor&rsquo;s site, the prospect had easy access to further information that confirmed his positive impression and led to his call.</p><p> Writing for the web may require adaptation of traditional marketing channels like brochures, but the rewards are well worth your effort.  Here are the challenges and how to meet them successfully.</p><h3> Special challenges of writing for the web</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Challenge #1: Grab readers immediately </strong></p><p> What drives readers most is timely information that&rsquo;s communicated clearly in the title of your post. The advisor in the opening anecdote had written about a new regulation related to taxes. Quick publishing via the web speeded timely communication to clients.</p><p> Make your content easy to look at, with short paragraphs, headings and sub-heads that state your content clearly, and layout that makes information flow and location of specific topics easy to grasp.</p><p> <strong>  Challenge #2: Use images </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/05/13/definitive-guide-finding-images-blog-posts-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Research  </a> </u>  has shown that the web is essentially a visual medium. Images attract viewers more than plain text.</p><p> If, like me, you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;word person,&rdquo; thinking visually can seem daunting. I always envied people who could draw clear diagrams of complex processes, while I required what seemed like too many words. The good news is that, as investment professionals, you&rsquo;re familiar with potentially the most compelling pictures for your audience: data visualization in charts.</p><p> Effective charts use  <u>  <a href=\"http://investmentwriting.com/2012/02/boost-chart-impact-with-interpretation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   interpretive titles  </a> </u>  that state the main idea, or story, of each one clearly and are accurate and faithful to your data.</p><p> If you enjoy taking pictures, include your own, either to personalize your site (e.g. show the photos in your office) or to illustrate your content. Your own photos are much more effective than stock photos of, say, the generic &ldquo;meeting.&rdquo;</p><p> Another effective way to use images is to provide a visual metaphor for what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not a good photographer, but I love art history and enjoy using paintings and photographs in my posts, especially as metaphors. Painters suspended on Brooklyn Bridge cables in 1914 means &ldquo;risk&rdquo; to me.</p><a href=\"/category/advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\" Eugene de Salignac/Courtesy NYC Municipal Archives\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bridge.jpg\"/></a><p> <br/> Because finding inexpensive, easy-to-use image sources with a good selection is a perpetual quest of everyone writing for the web, social media experts frequently  <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2015/03/20/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-visually-appealing-content/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Quicksprout+%28Quick+Sprout%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  recommend their favorites </a> . I&rsquo;ve used Dreamstime.com and 123rf.com. Trustworthy sources will explain copyright and other legal restrictions on images. Be sure to respect copyright. Providing attribution of images you use is a nice touch, whether or not it&rsquo;s required. This post supplies details as a hyperlink (&ldquo;Image Source&rdquo;).</p><p> <strong>  Challenge #3: Distinctive brand &ldquo;voice&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Write conversationally, referring to your own interests&mdash;family, leisure activities&mdash;to the extent that you&rsquo;re comfortable, using plain English to discuss financial concepts.</p><p> A sure way to make your voice distinctive is to follow up insights from your web analytics. Are you compiling bookmarks on a social media site? Include these ongoing updates in your newsletter. If newsletter analytics show an unexpected increase in the number of clicks on a bookmark or section of your newsletter, explore the subject in a blog post or future newsletter item, mentioning that this is your response to client feedback.</p><p> The opportunity to develop and distinguish your own voice is a good lead-in to the significant benefits of writing for the web, which are interrelated results of information accessibility and communication speed.</p><h3> Four Benefits of Writing for the Web</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Benefit #1: Enduring presence and broader potential audience </strong></p><p> The opening anecdote shows that easy distribution of information on the web broadened the advisor&rsquo;s potential prospects by building service awareness and providing easy access to further information that confirmed the prospect&rsquo;s favorable impression and motivated his call.</p><p> Have you ever lost a potential sale because the prospect lost the information you sent? Marketing on the web means that your posts remain available through search and referred links to existing clients, targeted prospects, and browsers. Your goal is to drive traffic to your site. The more you post to the web using multiple channels like your newsletter, blog, or social media sites like Twitter, the more people will find you.</p><p> <strong>  Benefit #2: Extended marketing scope through easy sharing of posts  </strong></p><p> We saw sharing from friend to friend. Another way of sharing content is through social bookmarking sites like Delicious.com, which I&rsquo;ve used for years to compile annotated lists of content recommended to clients. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Delicious-links.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" Writing for the web creates 4 marketing benefits\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Delicious-links.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Although all you need to post on Delicious is the URL, stating what benefits in the content led you to share it, as is done in the example above, is a greater service. Delicious.com also enables you to sort content by topic using tags, which can be bundled into groups, for example &ldquo;Retirement.&rdquo; Clients and prospects given access to your public account (I have a private account for my use and a public account with a different user name) can find what they need easily and become aware of new issues related to them and additional services you offer.</p><p> <strong>  Benefit #3: Enhanced lead capture through offers of free content  </strong></p><p> What&rsquo;s best for you about writing for the web? You can &ldquo;repurpose&rdquo; your content, turning it into a free offer available to readers who provide contact information requested.</p><p> Are you thinking of posting content that focuses on various stages of investors&rsquo; life cycles and includes the questions they should ask at each stage? Post it as a series, making readers aware of the series and future installments on your site, newsletter, and blog. When the series is complete, collect the installments and make them available as a free offer to visitors to your site and readers of your newsletter and blog.</p><p> Include a Call to Action with each free offer: e.g., &ldquo;Are you making a transition to a new phase of your financial life? Click here to get a free copy of &lsquo;Be financially prepared for all stages of your life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Benefit #4: Varied content that shows what working with you is like </strong></p><p> Services, unlike products, are experiential. Although clients can look at investment performance, they can&rsquo;t take you home for a free trial. How to deal with this? The best answer I&rsquo;ve found is to use your writing to simulate the experience of working with you as an advisor. Establish your distinctive voice through conversational analyses of market or regulatory events, explaining in plain language who they matter to and why.</p><p> Bring the words of your investment philosophy and practice values to life with stories showing how you helped clients fulfill their goals  while staying within their comfort zone for risk : Parents funding children&rsquo;s education; adults with financial resources to start a business, buy a home, or fund dreams of travel during retirement.</p><p> As you develop your sites and newsletters or blogs, you&rsquo;ll want to try new marketing strategies and forms of content. To help you move ahead, here&rsquo;s an excellent  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/66211-econsultancy-s-colossal-digital-marketing-jargon-buster/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  glossary </a>  of social media terms, with clear definitions and just the right amount of irreverence.</p>",

    "title": "7 Disadvantages You Need For Massive Success",
    "link": "7-disadvantages-you-need-for-massive-success",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Growing up in a rural area, going to a small college, and moving into the fast-paced business world, I felt at a disadvantage on many levels. Little did I know that these same disadvantages would give me the scrappiness I&rsquo;d need to succeed.</h3><p> <br/> It takes mental toughness to develop the healthy habits we need to overcome the disadvantages we face in life. I quickly learned that while surviving in my circumstances may be considered success; thriving in them is massive success.</p><p> Check out this list to see how how your disadvantages in life have prepared you for massive success:</p><h3> 1. Never Enough Money</h3><p> <br/> When you don&rsquo;t have money, you are forced to use your imagination. Innovation becomes a way of life at a very early age&mdash;I discovered that sticks are excellent rifles and swords, and dried cow pies can be amazing frizbees. </p><p> Buying what I wanted or needed was not an option for me as a kid, so creativity was the way I compensated. My early training to be creative and resourceful has served me well throughout life. </p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> If you want something, find a way to make it happen.</p><h3> 2. No Coddling by Parents and Family</h3><p> <br/> There were many times as a child when I felt very sorry for myself&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t come from one of those warm and fuzzy families that coddled their offspring.</p><p> My grandmother had ammo on her Christmas list! There are three things you never say to a grandmother who is a crack shot with a shotgun: &ldquo;You do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault.&rdquo; &ldquo;I quit.&rdquo;</p><p> But in the process, I learned how to fend for myself. If I found myself in a tough situation, I had to rely on myself to get out of it. </p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> Take responsibility&mdash;stop whining, blaming others, and pointing fingers if you don&rsquo;t get what you want.</p><h3> 3. The Constant Reminder of Mistakes</h3><p> <br/> I spent the better part of my early life as a hillbilly. I didn&rsquo;t have the polish of a sophisticated upbringing and so I made a lot of mistakes, both social and professional. </p><p> I learned from each one because I knew one thing: I didn&rsquo;t want to make the same mistake twice. It hurt too much the first time to not take the experience seriously and glean as much knowledge as I could from it.</p><p> As I look back and see the path I&rsquo;ve traveled, I understand now that the past is nothing but training. It doesn&rsquo;t define me.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> Mistakes are only stupid if you don&rsquo;t take the time to learn from them. </p><h3> 4. Surrounded by Loser Friends</h3><p> <br/> Since our cattle ranch was in a remote part of Wyoming, it was hard growing up without many friends. I was on a constant search to find other kids like me, but there just weren&rsquo;t that many. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t picky about with whom I chummed up but that was worse than having no friends at all.</p><p> I learned to be content with making friends and spending time with people who were very different from me. They stretched my thinking because they were so diverse.</p><p> We tend to spend time with people who are just like us, but when we do, we lack the feedback we need to force us out of our comfort zones and challenge us to question our beliefs.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> Dump the loser friends and learn to be adept at picking the right strangers with ties to what you hope to accomplish and then ask them the right questions.</p><h3> 5. Never an Easy Way Out</h3><p> <br/> I had to work really hard to get good grades&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t come easy. As a result, I knew I would need to develop other traits if I wanted massive success. In excavating those talents and abilities, I learned to tolerate discomfort, frustration, anger, failure, and rejection. </p><p> Mental toughness requires you to become acutely aware of all emotions so you can make the best choice about how to respond when the pop up. Mental strength is about accepting your feelings without being controlled by them.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> Stop expecting a handout; instead, develop the right attitude to make your own breaks in life.</p><h3> 6. Hard-Won Breakthroughs</h3><p> <br/> I took several wrong turns in life during my early years. Hoping for a breakthrough, I picked myself and started down another road, and I continued until I finally found the right path for me.</p><p> Our breakthroughs come from stress. We place a great deal of pressure on ourselves to see how much we can take and how well we respond. It&rsquo;s a form of training for life&mdash;we practice over and over again until we have a breakthrough and become someone we had no idea we could become. </p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> All the magic happens outside the comfort zone.</p><h3> 7. A Constant Hunt for the Good Stuff</h3><p> <br/> I spent several years trying to find the right job and the right relationship. During these gloomy times, I had to hunt to find the good stuff in my life. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot, and yet I made a concerted effort to identify at least 3 positive experiences every day.</p><p> Catch your negative thoughts before they spiral out of control and influence your behavior.Replace your negative thoughts with productive ones and reflect on your progress daily.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson Learned: </strong> Stop being a bore&mdash;instead, be grateful for your blessings.</p><p> Ironically, the disadvantages we&rsquo;ve faced in the past were the ones that helped us develop the mental toughness we need to be a massive success.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Let&rsquo;s just make this easy: don&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;utilize.&rdquo; &ldquo;Use&rdquo; is almost always the better choice. It&rsquo;s really that simple. </h3><p> <br/> I understand why you like &ldquo;utilize.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s got a nice ring to it. It sounds professional. It gives your copy an air of authority. But if it comes across my editing desk, I&rsquo;ll probably change it (there are exceptions I&rsquo;m willing to allow, and I&rsquo;ll get to those in a minute).</p><p> I know, I know, you&rsquo;re thinking I&rsquo;m that guy on the block who yells at the neighborhood kids to get off my lawn. And maybe editors can be a bit curmudgeonly&mdash;it comes with the territory when you&rsquo;re job is to enforce the rules. I don&rsquo;t like to think of myself as a curmudgeon (I don&rsquo;t yell at the neighbor kids, and come on, I have a soul patch!). I&rsquo;m willing to embrace the new when it comes to language. I really don&rsquo;t mind when someone uses &ldquo;their&rdquo; to avoid gender bias (Everybody take their seat). And as I like to point out when my father-in-law bemoans the use of &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; (Moses parting the Red Sea, he likes to say, was awesome, that cheeseburger was not) is that language evolves. Word meanings change over time. If none of this happened, we&rsquo;d be still be speaking Old English. So at some point in the future, this may be a moot point. Everyone will be utilizing &ldquo;utilize&rdquo; and editors will be swept under the wave of new usage and will be reduced to eye rolling when we come across it in copy.</p><p> So why even write about it? Well, because &ldquo;use&rdquo; is still a better choice. There are those who feel very strongly that &ldquo;utilize&rdquo; makes the writer sound pompous, and most editors will likely change it anyway. Also, the grammar nerds in your target audience will flinch when they see it, and you don&rsquo;t want your copy to make a bad impression, right? But no one will ever complain if you choose &ldquo;use&rdquo; in your copy, so why not stick to the path of least resistance?</p><h3> I mentioned before that there are exceptions to using &ldquo;utilize.&rdquo; First, there&rsquo;s utilize in the &ldquo;make use of&rdquo; sense of the word, but that can get a little sticky. Here&rsquo;s an example:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;The youth center received a donation of several computers, but it was unable to utilize them.&rdquo;</p><p> In this case, &ldquo;use&rdquo; might have been unclear&mdash;did the people at the youth center not know how to use the computers? But even in this case in which the center could not make us of the computers, I might suggest further clarification to address why (due to lack of space, for example). See, sticky.</p><p> The other exception is to use something for other than its intended purpose. For example:</p><p> &ldquo;MacGyver utilized the paper clip to defuse the ticking time bomb.&rdquo;</p><p> But even in that case, I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;use&rdquo; sounds better.</p><p> So let me just say again, make it easy on yourself, and choose &ldquo;use&rdquo; over &ldquo;utilize&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll almost always be in good shape.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thesovereignman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Simon Black  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.sovereignman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sovereign Man  </u> </a></p><p> In astronomy, there&rsquo;s an important concept known as &lsquo;parallax&rsquo;, which refers to how a star&rsquo;s position appears to change based on the position and motion of the observer.</p><p> The earth is constantly moving along its orbit around the sun. And as this happens, the position of a star in the night&rsquo;s sky will appear to change slowly, gradually over time.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a great view of the Southern Cross constellation from our farms in the south of Chile. But as the seasons change, the constellation appears to move very slightly, even though the stars themselves haven&rsquo;t budged an inch.</p><p> Small children discover an earthly example of parallax when they find that the position of an object appears to change slightly as they alternate closing their left and right eyes.</p><p> The idea is that the exact same object can appear to be different, even though neither you nor the object has moved an inch.</p><h3> Examples of parallax are everywhere&ndash; just look at China.</h3><p> <br/> If you close your left eye, China appears to be in a massive financial crisis thanks to a bursting credit bubble that has the potential to drag most of Asia, and possibly the world, into an era of massively depressed trade and asset prices.</p><p> But if you close your right eye, China has already become the world&rsquo;s second largest economy (and by some measurements the largest), and has accumulated more savings than every other nation on the planet.</p><p> Plus the Chinese renminbi&rsquo;s acceptance in foreign reserves, global payments, and international trade settlement is growing rapidly, and it even looks likely that the renminbi will be be anointed soon by the IMF.</p><p> These are two completely conflicting views of China. And yet they&rsquo;re both accurate.</p><h3> Or you can look at the US.</h3><p> <br/> If you close your left eye, the US dollar is strong. The labor market has recovered to its pre-crisis levels. The US is affluent and free.</p><p> But if you close your right eye, the dollar is astonishingly overvalued based on nearly every objective metric that exists, and the Federal Reserve is nearly insolvent on a mark-to-market basis.</p><p> The labor market has been completely hollowed out as the US work force now constitutes the lowest percentage of the American population since Jimmy Carter was President.</p><p> The US government itself is flat broke, based on its own financial statements.</p><p> Nearly every major program and institution, from Social Security to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, to the FDIC, is either insolvent or precariously underfunded.</p><p> The government cranks out 75,000+ pages of new laws, rules, regulations each year, many of which carry severe criminal penalties and govern the most private details of our lives, including how we are allowed to raise our own children and what we can/cannot put in our own bodies.</p><p> Police forces have turned into federally-funded paramilitary units, and a grand surveillance state now dominates over the citizens.</p><p> Civil Asset Forfeiture, the deliberate theft of citizens&rsquo; private property by the government with absolutely zero due process, is on an alarming rise.</p><p> And many of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution have become watered-down aphorisms rather than inalienable rights.</p><p> Again, two completely opposite views that are both accurate. And there are more examples everywhere.</p><p> Financial markets are on a knife&rsquo;s edge. Yet there are some absolutely incredible investments out there&ndash; high quality, profitable companies that are trading for less than cash, and beautiful properties that are selling for less than the cost of construction.</p><h3> Terrorism abounds. Risk abounds. But so does opportunity.</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s our world. It is simultaneously full of risk AND reward. The important thing is to look with BOTH eyes.</p><p> Know the risks. Be guided by objective data to understand them, and take action to minimize them.</p><p> But don&rsquo;t be overwhelmed by negativity. Don&rsquo;t panic. Instead, take simple, sensible steps to ensure your livelihood doesn&rsquo;t become a victim to someone else&rsquo;s stupidity.</p><p> Only then, with both eyes open, will you be able to see all the incredible opportunity that awaits, and be able to seize it from a position of strength.</p>",

    "title": "7 Bad Excuses and 3 Good Reasons for Not Engaging in Social Networks",
    "link": "7-bad-excuses-and-3-good-reasons-for-not-engaging-in-social-networks",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I originally drafted this list of &ldquo;excuses&rdquo; for not engaging in social networks back in 2010. That was back when Twitter was barely five years old, Facebook only had half a billion users ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1.5 billion and counting  </a> </u>  by 2015) and Google+ was merely a glimmer in  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Gundotra\" target=\"_blank\">   Vic Gundotra  </a> </u> &lsquo;s eye.</p><p> Back then, business professionals might have been excused for not paying attention to the 90 million worldwide users on LinkedIn. But these excuses are harder and harder to accept as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/272783/linkedins-membership-worldwide-by-country/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   115 million American and 11 million Canadian  </a> </u>  business people now use LinkedIn to prospect, sell, recruit and generally manage their business relationships.</p><p> Nevertheless, I still hear the same excuses. Here&rsquo;s how I respond to each one:</p><h3> 1. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for it.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Really? I have yet to meet a business professional who doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge that their business network is one of, if not THE, most important tools they have in business. It&rsquo;s who you know, not what you know, as the old saying goes. Online social networks are one of the most time-efficient ways of listening to your network and staying informed, while reaching out and adding value to key people. Successful business professionals make time for priority activities, like building their networks &ndash; even when it seems like there is no time.</p><h3> 2. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not where my clients are.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Well, at least this excuse recognizes that social networks are precisely for engaging existing clients and not just prospecting for new ones. If you&rsquo;ve actually surveyed your clients and know that most of them do not use social networks &ndash; in other words, if you are not projecting your own disinterest with social networks onto your clients &ndash; then you need to decide whether you can afford to neglect the portion (5% or 50%?) that do use social networks. You can be sure that if you&rsquo;re not engaging these clients online and nurturing your relationship with them, someone else is going to be trying to.</p><h3> 3. &ldquo;My firm&rsquo;s compliance department forbids it.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> For many regulated financial professionals, this so much less true today than ever. Yes, there are compliance restrictions in many settings, but the regulatory environment is nothing like it was in 2010. Social networks are emerging as places where people talk with each other, grow their networks and follow industry news. Even if you are operating in a more restrictive compliance setting, nothing is stopping you from personally using social networks and honing your own digital communications skills and awareness.</p><p> <a href=\"http://jaypalter.ca/2015/02/10-lessons-reformedbroker-can-teach-social/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p><h3> 4. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a clear return on investment.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> It wasn&rsquo;t long ago that every conversation about social media was about return on investment (ROI). Then people started to realize that social media wasn&rsquo;t all about marketing and selling, as it had appeared in the form of  consumer brand social media. Business-to-business (B2B) sellers and providers of professional services need to focus on using online social networks for educating, engaging and adding value &ndash; for NETWORKING, not marketing and selling. When we realize that the best social networking strategy is not short-term lead generation, then our need for quantifiable short-term ROI diminishes.</p><h3> Some excuses are better than others</h3><p> <br/> Not all excuses are all bad. Some betray a truth that must be addressed.</p><h3> 5.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> In many ways, this is one of the most honest excuses. Digital non-natives (those of us that didn&rsquo;t grow up with iPhones) can feel challenged and a bit disoriented by the hyper-sharing information landscape we now inhabit. What to blog about, what to share and why to do it is not obvious. What I say is this: People trust your knowledge and expertise, so share it with them. They want to know what you read and what you think about it &ndash; so share that kind of stuff. At the end of the day, people do business with people they know, like and trust. You need to be sharing things that reflect your unique perspective on the world, things that people can relate to.</p><h3> 6. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything unique to contribute.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This is the most baffling excuse I hear: Successful business professionals with years of education and training and practical experience telling me they don&rsquo;t have anything unique to say? And they genuinely think that. The best way to overcome this feeling is to realize that everything you know and do is unique to you because it is framed through the lens of your experience and personality. Your clients have chosen to work with you because of this uniqueness and the connection they feel to you. Your unique contribution is your perspective on the world. As Simon Sinek says, &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.&rdquo; Show people WHY you do what you do.</p><h3> 7. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand social media.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> I wish I heard this one more, but most people use the other excuses in order to avoid this admission. Social networking is evolving rapidly and, in turn, changing how and where we interact with each other. Acknowledging what we don&rsquo;t understand is the first step to learning. We all need to become students of social technologies because they are fundamentally about how we communicate.</p><h3> Social networks are not for everyone</h3><p> <br/> There are many people for whom social networks are just not a good fit. I come across these people all the time. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it.</p><p> I wanted to summarize a few of the best reasons that I&rsquo;ve heard for people not getting involved in online social networking:</p><h3> 8. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan on being in business for much longer.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Social networking and related digital technologies are evolving rapidly. Looking back on how much has changed in the past 5-10 years, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how much more will change in the coming 5-10 years. What I tell people is this: If you have a 3-5 year time horizon before you exit an active business role, go ahead and ignore social networking innovations.</p><h3> 9. &ldquo;My business caters to people who do not want a digital experience.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> As digital technology envelops us and transforms our interactions with each other, niche businesses will develop based on serving people in more traditional, non-technological ways. And the demographic bubble of the Boomer generation will ensure that there is demand for some of these traditional approaches for some time to come.</p><h3> 10. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not comfortable communicating online.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> If you were born in the late 19th or early 20th century, you could be excused for preferring travel by train or ship to commercial airplanes. Just as, if you came of age hand-writing your communications and perfecting the art of the face-to-face meeting, you could be excused for not embracing digital, asynchronous communications technologies.</p><p> It&rsquo;s alright to be uncomfortable or unfamiliar with digital communications. But let&rsquo;s agree to stop making excuses.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CheekyMunkeyUK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cheeky Munkey Ltd.  </a> </u></p><p> The internet offers a wealth of opportunity for staying in touch with family and friends; gathering helpful information, even paying bills and shopping from the comfort of your own home. If you have never used the internet before it can seem daunting but once you take small steps you will find it is much more accessible than you might first believe.</p><p> Naturally there are precautions you need to take to keep your data secure online. However, some of the scare stories you might have read make the internet sound more fraught with risk than it is. In this guide we will explore options to keep you safe and offer some further reading should you wish to delve into the topic further. We will also examine technical jargon, which might at first seem off-putting, but which will make sense once it becomes familiar to you.</p><p> Finally, we will look at some of the many ways the internet can be of benefit to your life, whatever your age. At heart the internet is about communication and bringing people closer. Whether that&rsquo;s your Grandson on a gap year travelling the world or the local department store who you would like to purchase a new vacuum cleaner from.</p><p> Make a cup of tea and take time to read this guide in full and then you can work through it section by section as you implement some of the ideas and enter the wonderful world of the internet.</p><h3> Technical Jargon and Getting Access to the Internet</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t want to start immediately with a computer at home your local library should have PCs available where you can familiarise yourself with introductory computer skills and they may even offer beginner&rsquo;s internet classes. This can be a worthwhile place to start. If you feel ready to connect to the internet from home, let&rsquo;s explore what you will need.</p><h3> A Computer</h3><p> This will usually be a PC which has Microsoft Windows installed or an Apple computer. Either way you will need to access the internet using some software called a browser.</p><p> If you purchase a Windows based PC there are several browser options including Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. If you use an Apple computer you will usually access the internet by a browser called Safari.</p><p> One final distinction is that your computer might be a desktop model, with a separate tower; monitor screen; keyboard; and mouse. Alternatively, it may be a laptop model with everything you need integrated. The latter allowing you greater flexibility as to where you use it.</p><p> An alternative to accessing the internet via a computer is to use a tablet, such as an iPad, or a mobile phone which could be an iPhone or an Android based model. These will usually have browser capability built-in and you will then just need a 3G connection or Wi-Fi to access the internet.</p><h3> Broadband Connection</h3><p> There are many companies who can provide you with access to the internet via broadband. These companies are called Internet Service Providers or ISPs. Depending where you live geographically and the ISP you choose, broadband speeds may vary. This guide from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/technology/broadband-tv-and-phone/guides/how-to-get-the-best-broadband-deal/what-broadband-speed-do-i-need/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Which  </a> </u>  will help you decide which broadband package will be the best option for you, depending on how much data you need and how much you wish to spend monthly.</p><h3> A Router</h3><p> Once you have selected an ISP and set up a contract with them they will provide you with a router. This is basically a small box which allows data to flow to and from the internet to your computer. A router can be connected via cabling or it may also offer a Wi-Fi option. Wi-Fi is a way to connect to the internet without cabling and it does so via radio waves, in much the same way as your mobile phone. The advantage of Wi-Fi is that it allows you to use a laptop or tablet wherever you are in the house.</p><p> You now have all the equipment you need to access the internet and can sit down in front of your computer ready to dive in and explore. Once you have opened your browser of choice you will want to find your way around the internet, let&rsquo;s find out how.</p><h3> Website Addresses</h3><p> <br/> Every website on the internet has an address of its own and if you know what this is you can type it into the browser bar at the top of the screen. Let&rsquo;s look at a website address we all recognise and examine the various components.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   https://www.Facebook.com  </a> </u></p><p> First, there is the &lsquo;http&rsquo; or sometimes &lsquo;https&rsquo;. What is the difference between these two?</p><p> The &lsquo;s&rsquo; stands for secure and therefore you should always check this is in place when you are using websites related to anything financial, such as online banking or when you are adding your credit card details to purchase something.</p><p> It is an extra line of security which the merchant uses so that your data cannot be accessed by malicious sources.</p><p> Next we have the &lsquo;www&rsquo; which stands for &lsquo;world wide web&rsquo; another term for the internet. The &lsquo;world wide web&rsquo; is a global interconnection of networks which allow us to access information across the world.</p><p> The next part is the name of the website itself, which is often a company name, such as Facebook. The &lsquo;com&rsquo; part at the end of this address is called an extension. The extension denotes whether the address relates to a company, an organisation, an educational establishment or even denotes a country. You will find examples of a wide range of extensions in this guide, including what they mean.</p><h3> Search Engines</h3><p> If we know the web address we can type it in as above with the example of Facebook. What happens if instead of having an address you want to search for information, such as a local plumber, a tutorial to show you how to sew a skirt or what time the local post office opens on Tuesday?</p><p> The great news is that all this information is now at your fingertips and you need what is called a &lsquo;search engine&rsquo; to find it. I am sure you will have heard of the largest search engine as the word has now entered mainstream language. The search engine in question is Google. There are other options however, such as Bing and Yahoo, and you should try them out to see what suits you best, but in this guide we will refer to Google as our search engine of choice.</p><p> All you need to do is to type  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google  </a> </u>  into the web address bar at the top of your browser and you will see a search box appear in the middle of your screen with the Google logo above it. You can then type in whatever you are looking for. Here are just a few examples:</p><li> emergency plumber in Portsmouth</li><li> low salt recipes</li><li> how do I sew a zip into a skirt <br/>  </li><p> You will then be given a long list of search results, which can go over several pages. You will need to keep scrolling down and click the &lsquo;next page&rsquo; option at the bottom of the screen if you want to see as many as possible. However, the ones that Google&rsquo;s search engine believes are the closest match to your query will be at the top of the first page. Spend a little time clicking on the websites it shows you here until you find what you are searching for. Sometimes, if you don&rsquo;t find exactly what you want, by slightly changing the wording in the query you can get a better result.</p><h3> Social Media and Blogs</h3><p> Two branches of the internet which bear mentioning, because they are a great way to keep in touch with both existing friends and family and to make new connections, are social media and blogs. Social media includes sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram and they are places where people connect; have conversations; and share information.</p><p> Both individuals and companies can be present on social media so it&rsquo;s also a good place to find out more about local and national businesses if you are considering shopping with them.</p><p> A blog, whose name came about from the longer word weblog, is a website which either individuals or companies regularly add information to, in what is called a post. You can find blogs about virtually every subject, such as crafts or classic car collecting, and they can also take the form of an online diary. If you want to delve into this subject a little deeper this  <u>  <a href=\"/category/learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BBC guide  </a> </u>  is a good place to start.</p><h3> Staying Safe Online</h3><p> <br/> We have established the internet can give you access to a whole world of information but what are the best ways to stay safe online?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s examine the key ways to improve your browsing security:</p><h3> 1. Install Anti-Virus Software</h3><p> There are malicious people who operate on the internet whose only aim is to infect computers with malware. Malware is software which attempts to disrupt the use of your computer; to steal personal data; or even to stop your computer from working. Malware is also continually evolving, so you need to keep your computer checked for malicious programs on an ongoing basis. The best way to do this is to install anti-virus software and to keep the software up-to-date. You can easily set whichever software you choose to automatically update and scan your computer daily for any issues. If the scan finds any malware it will then quarantine and destroy it before it causes any problems.</p><h3> 2. Choosing Robust Passwords</h3><p> Always select strong passwords for online accounts by making sure they are lengthy and made up of a mixture of upper and lower case characters; numbers; and special characters. Choose different passwords for all the different accounts you have and never reveal your password to anyone. In addition, if you have a Wi-Fi network in your home also ensure this is secured by password, so that strangers can&rsquo;t access your data.</p><h3> 3. Beware of Phishing</h3><p> Phishing is when you receive an email from what is supposed to be a reputable source, such as your bank or a store, requesting you to click on a link or input your personal information. These e-mails however are not from the person or business they purport to be, but are scams attempting fraud. Some of these can appear genuine so always be wary of any email you receive. If you want to check with the organisation whether the correspondence was from them, then contact them directly by telephone. The same is true if you receive an attachment in an email from someone you don&rsquo;t recognise. Never download the attachment as it may contain malware.</p><h3> Online Banking</h3><p> <br/> Online banking can make life much easier. You can transfer money to and from your account; pay bills around the clock; and escape waiting in queues at your local branch.</p><p> The tips mentioned above will go a long way to keep you safe and all should be implemented before you bank online. You can also check with your bank to see if they offer two-step authentication as this will keep you even safer. For example, some online banking can be set up so you receive a different code via a text message every time you log into your online bank account. This ensures that it is you accessing your account and not someone trying to commit fraud.</p><p> Never give out your user name or password to anyone, even if they purport to be from the bank, either over the phone or in an email. A bank will never ask for this information anyway. As a further precaution always check through your bank statements and if you see a transaction you don&rsquo;t recognise raise it with the bank immediately.</p><h3> Online Shopping</h3><p> Most reputable online stores will take every step possible to reassure you it is safe to purchase from them. However, to make sure you are as secure as possible ensure the following are in place before you make a purchase.</p><p> Secure Web Address: We talked earlier about making sure that online shops start their web address with https instead of http. Always check this is the case on the web page where you are being asked to input your personal and credit card details.</p><p> Physical Address: If you shop at a store whose name you recognise then this can give you some level of reassurance, particularly if they have a high street presence. If the website is for a lesser known store then ensure they provide a verifiable physical address and phone number.</p><p> Terms and Conditions: Check the store&rsquo;s privacy policy so you know what they will and won&rsquo;t do with your personal details. There should be a reassurance they won&rsquo;t pass or sell them to any 3rd party. In addition, always makes sure you read the store&rsquo;s cancellation and return policy.</p><p> One final point concerning online shopping and banking is to only do it on your own computer or one you know to be secure. It is best not to risk buying anything or accessing your bank account from a publicly used computer. In addition, don&rsquo;t use your mobile phone, tablet or laptop to make a purchase or to access your bank account on an unsecured Wi-Fi network, such as those in pubs and coffee shops.</p><h3> Making the Most of the Internet</h3><p> <br/> We have looked at making sure you are secure online and at two of the key advantages of the internet, which are shopping and banking. Now it&rsquo;s time to turn our attention to how we can make the most of the internet in other ways.</p><h3> Set Up an Email Account</h3><p> You will need an email address if you are going to do almost anything online, as this will be the method by which you receive logins and confirmations that accounts have been set up for you. E-mail also allows you to keep in touch with friends and family more quickly and easily, especially if they are scattered around the country or even the world. You can use a free e-mail account such as Gmail, Yahoo mail or Hotmail. Alternatively you can set up an e-mail account provided by your ISP, which will often be able to be accessed through Microsoft Outlook.</p><h3> Social Media</h3><p> We mentioned social media as a great way to connect with family but it&rsquo;s also a good way to find old friends you might not have seen for years or to connect with new people with similar interests or hobbies. Just as an aside if you ever decide to meet with someone who you have only come into contact with via an online source, always do so in a public place and preferably go to the meeting with a friend or family member. At the very least let someone know where you are going. People on the internet are not always who they appear to be and they can hide behind a false profile. Whilst you don&rsquo;t need to worry unnecessarily about this, it&rsquo;s always good to take precautions at any age.</p><h3> Research</h3><p> The internet is a great place to carry out research on whatever your interests are, from genealogy through to car maintenance.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YouTube.com  </a> </u>  has an array of videos which are tutorial based if you are struggling to master a skill or want to learn a new hobby, anything from crochet to astronomy.</p><p> There are also a wealth of how-to websites; informative blogs and even online classes available. Maybe you want to increase your computer skills; learn to ice a cake to a professional standard; or follow a daily yoga routine? It&rsquo;s all available online. The internet is also a valuable source of information if you are trying to plan travel, whether at home or abroad. You can look up train times; get detailed directions for car journeys; or plan your itinerary for a holiday. This is one of the strengths of the internet, there is truly something for everyone, whatever your interests.</p><h3> Useful Tools and Websites</h3><p> <br/> Some useful tools have already been highlighted as we worked through this guide but here are a few more resources which you may find helpful as you learn more about what the internet has to offer.</p><h3> Windows 10</h3><p> If you purchased a new computer to access the internet it may well have Windows 10 installed on it. This  <u>  <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-get-to-know-windows-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guide from Microsoft  </a> </u>  will help you make the most of all it can offer. If you are an Apple user then they offer similar  <u>  <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en_GB/manuals/macnotebooks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guides  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Vision Issues</h3><p> If you have any difficulties with your vision both Microsoft and Apple help to make the internet more accessible. You can find out how they do that in these  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windows10/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Microsoft  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple  </a> </u>  guides to accessibility.</p><h3> BBC Webwise</h3><p> This  <u>  <a href=\"/category/learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   website  </a> </u>  offers a wealth of information about improving your digital skills and learning about what the internet offers. It&rsquo;s a great place to start once you get online.</p><h3> Wikipedia</h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia  </a> </u>  is a free online encyclopaedia and offers information on almost every subject you can think of. It&rsquo;s a good first stop on any research quest.</p><h3> Online Marketplaces</h3><p> As well as a wealth of individual shops there are also marketplaces which bring together many vendors under the same roof. One of the most famous is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eBay  </a> </u> , but if you are interested in handmade items there are also sites such as  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Etsy.com  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://folksy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Folksy.com  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Health</h3><p> If you have any health problems the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NHS website  </a> </u>  can be a good port of call for any non- emergency issues. You can check symptoms; learn about diagnosis; and gain support for treatment moving forward with a condition.</p><h3> A Valuable Skill</h3><p> <br/> As you can see from this guide the internet offers a wealth of practical help, as well as entertainment and education. Therefore, extending your technical knowledge is well worth the time you will spend on it. The internet is a valuable resource for seniors and it can be particularly helpful for those with mobility issues as it makes doing many things, such as paying bills; keeping in contact with people; and shopping, much easier, as they can all be done from home. If you experience feelings of loneliness it can also help to alleviate this by making you feel less isolated.</p><p> If you run into any problems when you first access the internet try not to let it deter you as it isn&rsquo;t usually difficult to find a solution. Once you get past that initial learning curve, you will be so glad you made the decision to get online. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help from family members; from more tech savvy friends; and even at local classes which can run you through the basics, often for free.</p><p> The internet offers a wealth of opportunity for people, regardless of age, and as long as you implement the security precautions outlined earlier in this guide you can have an enjoyable and safe experience online.</p>",

    "title": "3 Roadblocks You Must Remove For Your Team (Before They Go Insane)",
    "link": "3-roadblocks-you-must-remove-for-your-team-before-they-go-insane",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Even if it all feels warm and wonderful, your team needs you to remove roadblocks. If they&rsquo;re frustrated with stupidity in the organization, they&rsquo;re frustrated with you. Sure, they appreciate the check-ins about their kid&rsquo;s soccer victories. And they want you to prepare them for the next promotion. But, if you&rsquo;re not out there with them doing some basic blocking and tackling, I&rsquo;d venture to guess, they&rsquo;re frustrated. Be a backer, and remove these three common roadblocks.</p><h3> Three Roadblocks Your Team is Longing For You to Remove</h3><p> <strong>  Roadblock #1: </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;re clear about what you want, but your colleague in the other department is sending an equally strong message to his team leading them in another direction.  Your team wants to achieve your vision, and feels your urgency, but they can&rsquo;t resolve the conflict without involving you&ndash;and the other team feels the same way. The conflict is getting more intense because no one feels empowered to reach a compromise. Both teams worry that any level of &ldquo;giving in&rdquo; will tick off their boss.</p><li> <strong>  The Roadblock: </strong>  Lack of Leadership Alignment</li><li> <strong>  To Get Results That Last: </strong>  Meet with your peer (and include a few key team members as appropriate) and align on a path forward. Hold metaphorical hands and send a clear messages to both of your teams about what needs to be accomplished and how they must work together. Anything else will waste precious time and energy, and make them question your leadership tenacity. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Roadblock #2 </strong></p><p> You know what your boss is asking for doesn&rsquo;t make sense for customers, employees, or shareholders.</p><li> <strong>  The Roadblock:  </strong> Your Boss&rsquo; Idea is Going to Hurt the Business</li><li> <strong>  To Get Results That Last:  </strong> When you let this go, you&rsquo;re hurting the business, and seriously damaging the relationship with your boss you&rsquo;re looking to protect. Trust me, your boss would much rather you take him off-line, in a private conversation and explain your concerns (listen carefully, she may have more information and an alternative perspective), than have you make a stupid decision. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Roadblock #3 </strong></p><p> Your team feels like they&rsquo;re operating in the dark. They do the best they can to guess what the stakeholders want, but when they present their strategy, it gets shot full of holes and creates frantic rework.</p><li> <strong>  The Roadblock:  </strong> Unclear Expectations</li><li> <strong>  To Get Results That Last: </strong>  Identify the key stakeholders and discuss their vision and expectations before your team gets to work. If gathering them all in the same room (or phone call) isn&rsquo;t wise or practical, do it one-on-one. If expectations aren&rsquo;t aligned it&rsquo;s better to work that out before the work begins. (See #1.) <br/>  </li><p> When you remove roadblocks, the team feels like you&rsquo;re on their side. Work gets done faster and with higher quality and less stress.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> In my  <a href=\"https://www.savvyladies.org/blog/teach-your-children-well-financial-literacy-is-the-key-to-economic-success\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   September column  </u>  , </a>  I wrote about the importance of teaching your children financial literacy.Mind you, keeping kids financially grounded is not for the faint of heart. By allowing children firsthand experience in earning, saving, and spending their own money, they are more likely to have a savvy sensibility about managing their expenses as adults. But kids are kids, and let&rsquo;s admit it&mdash;spending money is fun.So there&rsquo;s no better day than Thanksgiving to talk about the bounty of gifts you and your family has, and how kids can not only save for their financial futures&mdash;but how they can share their wealth with others.That is a tradition that I&rsquo;ve had with my children since they were little. In fact, Thanksgiving is more than a day for giving thanks&mdash;it marks the start of the season for expressing gratitude and sharing with others.</p><h3> Caring Is Sharing</h3>While many of us are focused on building wealth for our financial future, this is the perfect time of year to share with those who struggle to make ends meet. Here are a few of my family&rsquo;s traditions. I hope you are inspired to give back in your own special way.<li> <strong>  Thanksgiving baskets. </strong>  Part of my family&rsquo;s holiday tradition is to prepare items for Thanksgiving baskets for families of a sister parish in Washington, DC, whose congregants are less fortunate. Our mission is to provide money for food so that they can enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner in their homes.</li><li> <strong>  Blessing Baskets. </strong>  We also prepare Blessing Baskets filled with baby food, formula, and diapers to help the members of our sister parish take care of their babies.</li><li> <strong>  Choose a charity. </strong>  Other families that I know help their children understand the meaning of sharing by having their kids select a charity or special cause to support. Showing that you care about helping others sets a powerful example.</li><li> <strong>  Develop a family &ldquo;giving&rdquo; statement. </strong>  Similar to a family mission statement, a &ldquo;giving statement&rdquo; enables you and your kids to determine what percentage (of your income, or their allowance) you will give each month or year to a nonprofit organization, school, or other charitable cause.</li><li> <strong>  Turn the tables on &ldquo;Black Friday.&rdquo; </strong>  Instead of rushing out to the mall on the day after Thanksgiving, use your time, treasures, and talents to make gift bags for the giving trees.</li><h3> Timing Is Everything</h3>When you commit to instilling strong financial values in your children and encouraging their positive saving and spending habits, the benefits are immeasurable.Remind them that their self-worth is more important than their net worth. Managing money is a lifelong skill, so teaching your kids good habits early is a sound investment in their future. There&rsquo;s no time like Thanksgiving to start the conversation.&ldquo;The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&rdquo;&mdash; Chinese ProverbThis post originally appeared in Inkandescent Magazine.",

    "title": "Social Security: Now a Concern for Women",
    "link": "social-security-now-a-concern-for-women",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Social security has long been an issue for women. Now, with the changes to social security as a result of the recent Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, it appears that women are likely to be harmed more than any other demographic. The new rules governing social security filing strategies starting in 2016 make it more difficult than ever for women to maximize their benefits. </strong> <br/> <br/> Compared to other retirement assets, social security plays a disproportionately important role in providing income for women throughout their retirement. Generally speaking, some of the key factors affecting women in retirement are that they generally live longer than men, typically have a lower social security benefit amount, are more likely to be burdened with the expense of long-term care and they struggle more financially as a result of divorce. <br/> <br/> According to the Social Security administration, as of 2013, income from social security benefits accounted for nearly half of all retirement income for unmarried women, including widows age 65 or older. For retired women currently collecting social security, over 80% of them took their benefits early, permanently locking themselves into lower lifetime payments. For example, taking your benefits early, at say age 62 versus age 66, will result in a 25% permanent reduction in benefits. However, when surveyed, nearly 25% of respondents indicated that if they could do it over again they would have delayed the start of benefits in order to take advantage of higher lifelong benefits. <br/> <br/> To make matters worse, the new social security rules make it even more difficult for women to maximize benefits. For example, at present, married or qualifying divorced spouses who are entitled to both their own retirement benefits and spousal benefits can elect to collect just spousal benefits if they wait until full retirement age (66 in most cases) to file for benefits. A spousal benefit is equal to 50% of the other spouse's (or ex-spouse's) full retirement age benefit amount. While collecting spousal benefits, their own benefit would increase in value by 8% per year to age 70, when they would switch to their own now higher benefit. <br/> <br/> Under the new Budget Bill, however, the ability to temporarily claim just spousal benefits is being phased out. Married or divorced spouses who are at least age 62 by the end of 2015 will retain the right to claim only spousal benefits at age 66, assuming that their spouse has filed for benefits. Divorced spouses who were married for at least 10 years, divorced for at least two years and are currently unmarried are entitled to social security benefits off of their ex's earnings record. However, married individuals or divorced spouses younger than 62 by the end of 2015 will no longer be able to collect only spousal (or ex-spousal) benefits. They will have to take the higher of the two benefits when they file. <br/> <br/> Another major rule change involves the elimination of a claiming strategy called \"file and suspend\". This allowed a worker who reached full retirement age or older to claim social security and immediately suspend his or her benefits. Currently, this would allow a spouse and a minor child to collect benefits off of the worker's record while the worker allowed his own benefit to increase by 8% per year to age 70. Under the new budget rules, their is less than a six month window to take advantage of file and suspend. Only those who turn age 66 or older by May 1, 2016 will be eligible to take advantage of this filing strategy. <br/> <br/> The elimination of file and suspend typically harms married and divorced women in particular because they will no longer be able to collect a spousal (or ex-spousal ) benefits while allowing their own benefit to increase by 8% to their age 70. Many women have comparatively lower benefits than men because either they had lower wages than men (still a battle being fought) or they worked fewer years as a result of staying home to raise children. File and suspend offered a way for women to allow their benefits to grow and \"catch up\" while collecting spousal benefits. Now this opportunity is being phased out. <br/> <br/> For single women, file and suspend offered another benefit. Say a single women filed and suspended her benefit at age 66 and allowed it to increase by 32% to their age 70. Then suppose at age 70 she found out that she was seriously ill (or even that she just needed money for some reason), she would be eligible to go to social security and have them pay her a lump-sum of money equal to those 4 years of cumulative \"suspended\" benefits and then start her payout as if she had filed at age 66. File and suspend offered this \"safety net\" for women (and men) but it is going away in less than 6 months thanks to the new budget rules. <br/> <br/> More than ever, women need to take a closer look at planning for retirement. Given that social security is a critical component of retirement income for most women, it is imperative that women seek out advice from a qualified social security planning specialist who can help guide them through the \"new maze\" of social security rules. With deadlines as early asMay 1, 2016, there really is no time to waste.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114323730459013407332\" target=\"_blank\">  Michael Conlon </a> The duty of an investment advisor to put a client&rsquo;s interest before their own as a fiduciary permeates all aspects of operations of an advisory firm, but are most pronounced when managing client portfolios and engaging in securities transactions. When an investment advisory representative (&ldquo;IAR&rdquo;) is considering a trade for a client, they must also consider how that decision impacts their overall client base so that they can ensure the decisions made are done for all clients fairly and equally. As a result, areas of our operations where we are managing client portfolios must go through some aspect of compliance consideration in order to ensure that the proper process or controls are in place to address compliance risks.</p><h3> Portfolio Management In a Nutshell</h3>When managing securities for clients of your advisory firm, it is important to consider the compliance issues related to the group of all clients in addition to the unique issues for each individual client. The services your firm offers and the tools that are used to accomplish operational goals can introduce compliance risks that need to be considered and supervised for potential violations and to document such supervision for your firm's books and records.If your advisory firm allows clients to impose restrictions on the management of their portfolio, it is important to capture these restrictions and configure your tools or perform reviews to ensure they are not violated. For example, a client with a legacy share position from their prior employer may want to keep that position and restrict their advisor from selling it. The advisor would want to consider ways in which they could flag or restrict that position to ensure it is not accidentally traded during a rebalance of the client&rsquo;s portfolio. As CCO, you may want to put together a list of account restrictions across your clients and review the individual accounts periodically in order to confirm the restrictions have been honored.RIA firms are required to apply supervision to the investment decisions made for their clients to ensure related aspects of the fiduciary duty such as suitability, best execution, trade error management, engaging cash, rebalancing, trade restrictions, and other issues related to portfolio management are evaluated and analyzed for potential compliance violations. If an RIA firm is not applying proper supervision to their trade operations, this can lead to compliance violations, client complaints, and ultimately regulatory action. Since many aspects of an RIA firm&rsquo;s portfolio management operations are unique, depending on the services, vendors, and affiliate or other third-party relationships they may have, CCOs will want to review those different tools and relationships used by Supervised Persons of the RIA firm and have an understanding of how they are used in order to properly apply that supervision and compliance review.<h3> Through the Regulator&rsquo;s Eyes</h3>With regard to portfolio management at your RIA firm, regulators expect that you fully understand and can speak to compliance issues relating to your operational tools and services, including third-parties that may be providing services to your firm or to your clients. By doing so, you can demonstrate that as CCO you are providing adequate supervision to the activities of your RIA firm, and overall that the firm is upholding its fiduciary duty to its clients. You are expected to have an understanding of how compliance impacts your firm&rsquo;s portfolio management operations, speak to the issues involved, and maintain proper books and records that demonstrate that you are meeting these requirements in accordance with the Adviser&rsquo;s Act.<h3> CCO Best Practices</h3>CCOs of RIAs have an obligation to understand, supervise and document the firm&rsquo;s operations as they relate to compliance activities, depending on your tools and services provided. The CCO should review their portfolio management policies and procedures in their compliance program and speak to the following issues:<li> Are clients permitted to impose trading restrictions? <li>  How are the restrictions captured to ensure they are respected? </li> <li>  Is there a way to restrict in the system? </li> <li>  What is the frequency of review of client accounts with restrictions? </li></li><li> Sub-advisors <li>  Does your firm outsource investment management to another advisor? </li> <li>  Are you performing due diligence on the sub-advisor before engaging? </li> <li>  Are you providing ongoing supervision to the client assets being managed by the sub-advisor? </li> <li>  Do you have books and records to support your answers? </li></li><li> Automated order management systems <li>  Do you use a system to automatically execute trades based on pre-configured settings? </li> <li>  Are you reviewing exception reports of the automated system? </li> <li>  Are you providing ongoing supervision to the client assets being utilized in the automated system? </li> <li>  Do you have books and records to support your answers? </li></li><li> Other potential areas of concern <li>  Cash balances </li> <li>  Portfolio rebalancing </li> <li>  Brokerage recommendation or discretion </li></li>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.&rdquo; &ndash; Mother Teresa</p><p> Mother Teresa knew that change very rarely happens in big swooping gestures, but in smaller movements, often personal decisions. As a leader, you have the chance to make changes that could produce big results. But to be highly effective, those changes need to small and intentional.</p><p> Here are five small changes you can make that can lead to big results.</p><li> <strong>  Learn Something Every Day. </strong>  The more you know, they healthier you tend to be. Reading articles online will grow your knowledge over time. Warren Buffet, one of the richest people in the world, is said to read over 500 pages a day just to learn. If you aren&rsquo;t a reader, listen to books on tape or podcasts. This small change can add up to big results in your brain power and can also reverse any downward spirals in your thinking abilities.</li><li> <strong>  Do Something New. </strong>  Sometimes work can feel like a rut or a grind and you might crave a change. Instead of making a big change like a new job, make a small change. Switch up your schedule. If you eat every day at the same time, try eating 30 minutes sooner or later. Try a new perfume or cologne. Fresh smells can create innovative sensory experiences which can make your day or week feel brand new.</li><li> <strong>  Bring Playfulness Into Your Day. </strong>  Remember when you were 9 years old? What did you like to do? Try doing it again. Find a park and whizz down a slide or swing for a while. Maybe throw a football around or bake a cake from a recipe your mom always used. This kind of small change can slow down your life for a bit and hit reset. After recharging, your child-like energy will help you tackle your work in a new way.</li><li> <strong>  Change Your Speed-Dial List. </strong> If you have a top ten list on your phone that are made up of business-related people, maybe it&rsquo;s time to reevaluate that list. Business situations change, so it is important to reevaluate your business priorities. Every time you look at what is important in your life, even if you only make small changes, you naturally reset your vision for your work or life, which usually results in positive growth.</li><li> <strong>  Change Your Surroundings.  </strong> Your office often reflects who you are and where you have been. It might even reflect where you are going. If you want to grow, it is important to change your office. Life is full of adjustments and compromises and your office can be a vital reminder to you to move toward your goals. <br/>  </li><p> The opportunities of a new path are open to you, but you must move forward in focus. Making these small changes can increase your focus and productivity. Like Mother Teresa, if you cast those stones across the water making small changes in your life, the results will creative positive ripples throughout your life.</p>",

What is?Asking great questions.Whenever I&rsquo;m in front of my clients, I like saying &ldquo;The quality of your sales depends on the quality of your conversations. The quality of your conversations depends on the quality of your sales&rdquo;.Great questions elicit insights. Build rapport. Forge a strong, emotional connection with your prospect. Position you as a trusted advisor. Help you uncover the real, underlying buyer objectives. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Great%20questions%20do%20the%20selling%20for%20you.&amp;via=Acluytens&amp;related=Acluytens&amp;url=http://agocluytens.com/questions-uncover-buyer-objectives/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Great questions do the selling for you  </u>  . </a> By the way, if you want to know more about which questions I LOVE asking my clients, check out these three posts:</p><li> <u>  5 Helpful Sales Questions You Should Be Asking Every Buyer </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tested-proven-only-3-sales-questions-youll-ever-need-ago-cluytens/\" target=\"_blank\">   Tested And Proven: The Only 3 Sales Questions You&rsquo;ll Ever Need  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/selling-c-suite-5-questions-ask-before-meeting-ago-cluytens/\" target=\"_blank\">   Selling To The C-Suite ? 5 Questions To Ask Before The Meeting  </a> </u></li>But back to questions. Great questions sell. But it&rsquo;s not just about asking questions (after all, if it were just about asking questions, you could ask whatever you want and &ldquo;automagically&rdquo; close more sales. And things don&rsquo;t quite work that way, do they?).In addition to knowing which questions to ask (see above), you&rsquo;ll also need a strategy for asking questions. Specifically, I want you to start thinking about questions in four categories.<h3> Open Questions</h3>Open questions are questions designed to get a prospect to talk. Again, don&rsquo;t just use any questions (and please don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;What keeps you up at night&rdquo;), but make sure that each question you ask serves a specific purpose.Some of my favourite open questions are:<li> Why are we speaking ? Why did you decide to invest the time?</li><li> Can you briefly tell me what you&rsquo;re looking to accomplish?</li><li> What is your #1 priority right now, and why? (asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; is key)</li><li> Ideally, what would you like to see happen as a result of our work together 6&ndash;9 months down the road?</li><li> How would you know this has been successful? What would you see?</li>Open questions are great to start conversations, and help uncover buyer objectives. But they&rsquo;re not so great when you&rsquo;re trying to validate options, work towards a decision or seal the deal. That&rsquo;s when closed questions are a much better fit.<h3> Closed Questions</h3>Closed questions are questions that are designed to present a choice, and get a clear answer from your prospects (and by the way, the answer doesn&rsquo;t always have to be yes/no, see below).Some of my favourite closed questions are:<li> Are you looking to make a decision right now, or at some point in the future?</li><li> How urgent is this for you: very, somewhat or not at all?</li><li> (After I&rsquo;ve walked them through 2&ndash;3 scenarios on how to work together): which option would you prefer?</li><li> Are you ready to move forward, or is there anything else you need from my side?</li>Closed questions are deceptively simple, but they&rsquo;re a very powerful tool in any sellers&rsquo; arsenal of strategies. When used well, they can be used to convince buyers, create a sense of urgency and help close sales more quickly and effectively.Asking open and closed questions are must-have skills for any seller, and mastering them is key to sales success. But, if you&rsquo;re just using questions in this way, you&rsquo;re missing out. There&rsquo;s another, important secondary dimension to asking question.Watch &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffpai8c2rLk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  4 Must-Ask Questions To Uncover Buyer Objectives </a></u>&rdquo; on YouTube<h3> Macro-level Questions</h3>Macro level questions are designed to bring the conversation up to a higher level &ndash; to get your prospect to talk about their strategy, vision, long-term outlook and legacy.If you want to get prospects excited and talking about their dream, or vision for changing their world (organisation, life, career, &hellip;), there&rsquo;s nothing like asking a series of carefully crafted macro-level questions.Some of my favourite macro-level questions are:<li> What are your priorities for the next 2&ndash;3 years?</li><li> Let&rsquo;s imagine this goes well: what would you like people to remember you for?</li><li> At some level, we all work for more than money. What&rsquo;s your primary motivation (for doing this)?</li><li> Let&rsquo;s step away from the short term for a second: what do you think the long-term impact of this will be?</li><h3> Micro-level Questions</h3>Some prospects love to talk about the big picture stuff. And many prospects (especially in large organisations), love to talk in broad terms, using words like &ldquo;enablement&rdquo;, &ldquo;overarching objectives&rdquo; and &ldquo;alignig stakeholders&rdquo;.And that&rsquo;s fine, but all of those are very vague descriptions, and can carry a lot of meanings. For fear of being &ldquo;found out&rdquo;, or seen as not all that competent, many sellers are afraid to stop and ask them what they mean by those terms.Big mistake.Unless you know exactly what your prospect means by certain terms, you&rsquo;ll always stay selling at a vague, conceptual level. You&rsquo;ll never uncover the real details, the nitty gritty, the minute aspects of what they&rsquo;re really trying to achieve.Take a statement like &ldquo;we need to align the main stakeholders&rdquo;, for example. Whenever I&rsquo;m coaching salespeople, I notice they have a tendency to leave things like this slide. Just nod, and keep the conversation going.But the very best sellers do something very different. They dig, and they dig deep.To start, they might say something like &ldquo;Excuse me. &rdquo;Aligning stakeholders&ldquo; is a flag that can cover many loads. Would you mind expanding on that a little ?&rdquo;.Then, they use some of the questions below:<li> What exactly do you mean by _______?</li><li> Who should be involved?</li><li> Why does that matter so much?</li><li> In reality, what would that look like?</li><li> What would be the most important/first step we&rsquo;ll need to take?</li>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in sales training, you&rsquo;ve probably been told to &ldquo;ask questions&rdquo;. And then left to your own devices, or given a few &ldquo;sample&rdquo; questions like I included in this post. Problem is: that&rsquo;s either too broad, or too rigid.Simply asking questions isn&rsquo;t going to get you anywhere. And just having a carefully defined list of questions will often mean you&rsquo;re not uncovering as much information as you could, or you keep turning in circles.What you need is a framework &ndash; something that allows you to be systematic and strategic about asking questions. Scaling up and down as needed. Mixing it up as you move through the sales conversation. Asking questions that both clarify and define.<h3> Try This: A Simple Tool To Uncover Buyer Objectives</h3>Using the framework below, draft 4&ndash;5 questions for each category. Try to mix it up, and cover different topics, areas, angles, &hellip; The first few times, you might want to take this with you when you go to a prospect or client meeting. Then, as time develops, you&rsquo;ll start memorizing certain questions, and develop your own set of go-to questions. ",

    "content": "<h3> When the media talks about millennials, Gen-X and baby boomers in the workplace, most of the article titles pit them against each other. Baby boomers are frustrated by the entitlement and technology dependency of millennials, while millennials are tired of hearing these stereotypes and generalizations from older employees who seem envious or bitter.  </h3><p> <br/> In other words, no one seems to want to put in the time to get to know one another; thus, the stereotypes. In order to have an inclusive workplace, we need to put more effort toward understanding people in our office, regardless of which generation they&rsquo;re part of. This is what Mona Gable tells us in her article  <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/05/millennial-and-boomer-women-should-be-friends-its-good-for-their-careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Millennial and boomer women should be friends. It&rsquo;s good for their careers.  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  On a work trip to Chile, Gable was traveling with three millennial women. While she felt unsure of how the trip would go, she was pleasantly surprised to find that she learned something from the women, and vice versa.</p><p> Though there are many differences between the generations, female millennials and baby boomers have a lot in common, such as the struggle to be a woman in the workforce. One of those commonalities is that &ldquo;&hellip;young women are still fighting for the same family-leave policies we were two decades ago,&rdquo; writes Gable. &ldquo;Despite a majority of women with children in the workforce, we still don&rsquo;t have national child care or paid parental leave&hellip;&rdquo; Gable also points out another similarity&mdash;millennials and baby boomers have also gone through recessions and have experienced the hardship of entering bleak job markets.</p><p> Establishing common ground is important for being inclusive. After all, once we recognize our similarities, we can see that we have things to learn from each other, whether we&rsquo;re the same age or not. Gable mentioned in her article that she learned many things from her millennial travel companions, such as gaining fresh perspective on old ideas and navigating the world of technology. Likewise, millennials can learn from the professional experiences of more seasoned employees.</p><p> Inclusive leaders need to take a more active role in smoothing tensions between generations. We need to create a culture that fosters the kind of learning that can take place in an intergenerational office. One way to promote this inclusion and learning is to have mentorship programs in your office. Pairing one or two new employees with an experienced baby boomer can help to minimize the stigma and misperceptions of both generations.  </p><p> Another idea is to have mini presentations in the office. Your millennial employees can have an opportunity to present on skills such as how social media and SEO can enhance your company&rsquo;s visibility. Baby boomers can share the importance of face-to-face networking and provide advice on how to succeed in the workforce and grow careers. Allowing each generation to have the floor will provide them with credibility among their coworkers, which will increase inclusion and understanding of all generations in your workplace.</p>",

    "content": "<p> For many financial advisors, client service has turned into a series broken of promises.  The best of intentions have turned into sloppy messes.  They're are heaps of confusing, conflicting activities&hellip;poorly designed and impossible to execute.</p><h3> Why?</h3><p> <br/> It usually starts with too many clients.  And continues with mazes of perplexing clients segments.  In the end, there aren&rsquo;t enough hours in the day to keep up.</p><p> The freedom that should come with a healthy, growing business turns into ulcers.  You wonder&hellip;</p><li> when you spoke with a client last</li><li> where you&rsquo;ll find time to return calls</li><li> how you&rsquo;ll keep up with the recurring contact sequences you put in place</li><li> why you got yourself into this mess <br/>  </li><p> The freedom to work with clients you enjoy doesn&rsquo;t feel free if you can&rsquo;t make sense of it.  If it becomes unrecognizable because you&rsquo;ve layered patches on top of fixes, it turns client service into a chore.</p><h3> &ldquo;In a client-focused practice, the client part should be FUN.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> What&rsquo;s needed?  </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Two things:  </strong>  fewer clients and a repeatable service model.</p><p> Yes, that&rsquo;s what I wrote&hellip;fewer clients.  More is not better.  The 80\\20 rule tells the story, deny it at your own peril.</p><p> Think of this as getting down to your core.</p><p> In recent years, I&rsquo;ve worked with hundreds of advisors on this very issue.  From out of control teams with hundreds of tangled clients to highly specialized practices with clear focuses, the question remains constant:  <strong>  Can you do more with less? </strong></p><p> The answer is always a resounding YES.</p><li> Revenues double and triple as advisors shed hundreds of clients from their books.</li><li> High-quality referrals stream in as advisors raise the bar to entry into their practices.</li><li> Sanity is restored when teams really get to know their most important clients. <br/>  </li><p> These are all signs of freedom&hellip;financial freedom, freedom of client selection, freedom of time and freedom from stress.</p><p> <strong>  This freedom can be compounded when you add a REPEATABLE service model. </strong></p><p> A while back, I was talking with an advisor about his client contact routine.  He already bought into the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; mind set. </p><p> Yet while producing well over 7 figures of annually recurring fees with fewer than 75 clients, he admitted to &ldquo;losing touch&rdquo;.</p><p> And now, some of his clients were grumbling loudly.</p><p> For the first time in years, he had just fought off an account transfer.  This top 25 client was looking for greener pastures.  A decades-old relationship was willing to try out a veritable rookie at another firm.</p><p> <strong>  The client felt ignored.  </strong> He no longer knew what to expect from the advisor.</p><p> The fact that this client&rsquo;s portfolio was outpacing the S&amp;P 500 didn&rsquo;t matter.  All the time the advisor had put into this client&rsquo;s financial plan didn&rsquo;t matter.  The advisor&rsquo;s 60, 70 and 80-hour workweeks didn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p> Deep down, the advisor felt sure this revolt wasn&rsquo;t isolated to just one client.</p><h3> What was missing?</h3><p> <br/> A disciplined client care ritual.  The time gained from managing fewer relationships had spun out of control.  The goal of more time for fewer clients had been dashed.  He was actually spending MORE time in the office each week.</p><p> What could be more important than spending time with clients?</p><p> So we implemented a monthly contact routine.  The idea was to dedicate a specific hour each month to each client.  With 75 clients, that&rsquo;s been less than four hours per day.  <strong>  More importantly, it&rsquo;s a repeatable approach to client care. </strong></p><p> His clients love it.  Now, they know what to expect each and every month.</p><p> In subsequent months, the advisor spent less time in the office.  He had a huge increase in referrals from his clients.  His year over year production grew measurably.</p><p> By applying the discipline of a repeatable client contact to a limited number of clients, <strong>   he has improved the quality of his freedom. </strong></p><p> I have seen this scenario play out over and over again.  The results are dramatic and sustainable.</p><p> <strong>  Discipline applied to client care means greater freedom! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Glitter! Love it or hate it, the Holiday season isn&rsquo;t complete without a little sparkle! Our DIY project today sees us getting messy with glitter to create a set of pretty DIY ombre glitter pinecones. Perfect for adding a little festive twinkle to your Holiday home decor, our ombre glitter pinecones make a great kids craft or fun afternoon DIY project. You can use found pinecones, or purchase them from your local craft store. Starting at the bottom, use a paint brush to cover the bottom couple sections of your pinecone in mod podge or similar craft glue. Roll the pinecone in your darkest color of glitter and let it dry. Move up the pinecone, using a lighter color of glitter with every step until your pinecone is covered. Once they are all dry you can set them on the branches of your Holiday tree, group them together on your mantle or in a bowl as a table centerpiece. Perfect!</p><p> <img alt=\"Glitter_Ombre_Pinecone\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lia-griffith-media/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Glitter_Ombre_Pinecone.jpg\"/></p> ",

    "content": "<p> Today is Thanksgiving. For many of us, that means not just a traditional meal with family and friends, but also a reflection on what we&rsquo;re most grateful for this year. If you look around your table on today, the odds are high that you&rsquo;ll be sharing your feast with at least one family caregiver. <strong>  And since November is also National Caregivers Month, Thanksgiving is the perfect time to show support and thanks for the caregivers among us. </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s an important gesture, largely because caregivers as a whole are underappreciated and undervalued. I recently read a statistic that there are 90 million family caregivers in the US. In a population of 290 million, that means more than a quarter of the population is serving as a caregiver today. And what a job it is!</p><h3> Imagine reading this job posting:</h3><p> <br/> Seeking an energetic, personable, patient employee to work 20-120 hours a week&hellip;for the next decade or more. Must be able to manage minor and major crises on a daily basis, as well as complete physically strenuous tasks under emotionally taxing circumstances. Some finance and managerial skills required. No pay.</p><p> Would you apply? Caregiving may be one of the toughest jobs out there.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/ppi/info-2015/caregiving-in-the-united-states-2015.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Caregiving in the U.S.2015  </a> </u> , a joint study between the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.caregiving.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   National Alliance for Caregiving  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AARP  </a> </u> , reports that caregivers who provide unpaid care for 21 hours or more each week report the highest stress of all caregiving groups, and that the typical high-hour caregiver provides care for an average of five years and expects to continue care for another five years. Caregiving often consumes the life of the caregiver&mdash;sometimes for decades&mdash; yet their role has no economic value. They can&rsquo;t put it on a resume, they receive no Social Security credit, and they receive no monetary reward.</p><p> Perhaps the dilemma is so close to my heart because I speak from experience. My husband, Ed, suffered a debilitating stroke when he was in his mid-50s. On the day Ed was released, I was packing up his things to leave the hospital when  <u>  <a href=\"http://voiceofoc.org/2012/05/dr-ken-bell-ken-bell-associates-health-care-consulting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dr. Ken Bell  </a> </u> , our friend and the medical director at the hospital, came by. His words had a huge impact on me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to be a loving wife and a full-time caregiver,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;Get all the help you can so you can remain a loving wife.&rdquo; And I listened to him. That first year, I hired a live-in aide and a driver. I think that decision both kept me sane and protected Ed and my relationship in a very stressful time. It also helped Ed toward his recovery, largely because he despised needing help. He hated having the aide tie his shoes, so he learned to tie them himself. He hated being driven, so he learned to drive again. And through it all, I was free to dote on him in the role of his loving wife. As Ed&rsquo;s recovery advanced, I eventually had to let the help go, and I became Ed&rsquo;s caregiver after all. For the next eight years, I did my best to disprove Dr. Bell&rsquo;s advice and serve as Ed&rsquo;s caregiver while trying to remain a loving wife. It was the hardest job I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p><p> Dr. Bell&rsquo;s words of wisdom were foreshadowed years earlier when my mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease. She lived thousands of miles away in New Jersey, and I was racked with questions: What is my role? What can I do to help her&mdash;even from a distance? What should I expect as the disease progresses? I needed help, so I joined a local support group. What I saw there illustrated the challenges faced by family caregivers. Many of the (mostly) women in the group had given up their lives to care for their own mothers. As a result, they were filled with anger and resentment. They felt isolated and as though the weight of the world was on their shoulders. They hated the situation, and that was translating into hatred for the very people they were doing all they could to love: their mothers.</p><p> While in some cases a caregiver&rsquo;s isolation is circumstantial, in others it is self-inflicted. My friend Robert is struggling with his wife&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. She&rsquo;d been a highly respected physician, and he doesn&rsquo;t want the community&mdash;or even his own family&mdash;to know about her dementia. Keeping her condition a secret is adding even more stress to an already stressful situation, and I can see it wearing on their relationship. They&rsquo;re both so alone.</p><h3> But when caregivers are supported and openly appreciated, the outcome can be quite different.</h3><p> <br/> A decade ago, my good friend Denise was in between jobs. She was a busy, highly paid executive, and for the five years prior, her sisters had been serving as caregivers for their mother in her advancing stage of Pick&rsquo;s disease. The timing was perfect, so Denise postponed her job search for a year and stepped in to give her sisters a much-needed respite and care for her mother. She&rsquo;s told me that those 12 months were one of her greatest gifts. Yes, the job was tough, but she had the support of her sisters, and she was able to find a wonderful assisted care facility for her mother that could better serve her changing needs as the disease progressed. Even better, Denise was able to repair her relationship with her mother. Today they&rsquo;re closer than they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p><p> Every situation is different, but it seems that by working together as a family, even the most trying circumstances can be made easier. So take a few minutes today to express your thanks to the caregivers in your own family. Even better, take some time to review this  <u>  <a href=\"http://healthylivingmadesimple.com/tackle-caregiving-list/?utm_source=hootsuite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   caregivers to-do list  </a> </u>  together. Your appreciation and support may make all the difference in helping them enjoy the holiday season more fully&mdash;no matter what daily challenges they face in the month to come.</p><p> Is caregiving a challenge in your own family? Please  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:lauren@kleinadvsors.com\">   email me  </a> </u>  your story. I&rsquo;d love to hear it. And if there&rsquo;s anything I can do, let me know. I&rsquo;m always here to help.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> In recent months I have been observing a rather unnerving trend. People just asking for things, rather than adding value or trying to pay forward, especially on social media.</h3><p> <br/> Almost every day I get invitations to connect on LinkedIn and while I try to screen as much as I can, without prejudging, there is a considerable number of people who want to connect with the sole purpose of selling stuff. And by that I mean that as soon as I hit \"accepted\" I get a solicitation. Rather irritating......</p><p> It's become really bothersome and today, given the holiday spirit I decided to write about it and to ask everybody who is part of this business network to be mindful and considerate.</p><p> There is nothing wrong with using LinkedIn or other social media platforms for business purposes, but everything wrong with just connecting in order to push an agenda.</p><p> And that is what's been happening. Social media members not taking the time to research, analyze or pre-qualify. It seems that there is a large group of the business people just looking for key word matches and then, instead of building a relationship first, immediately pushing their service, whether it's a match or not.</p><h3> What happened to paying forward? To being considerate? To adding value first?</h3><p> <br/> Thanksgiving is a holiday where we should take a step back and be grateful for what we have, and I am. I am grateful for the ability to connect with people all over the world.</p><p> Just last week I had a meeting with a person who had reached out to me (after researching my background and determining a fit) during my visit to Vienna and after we arranged a conference call we realized that we were both in Vienna at the same time (her living there and me visiting), so we had coffee together. Once of those lucky coincidences where social media is a blessing.</p><p> So, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, let's be more mindful, more considerate and let's pay forward a bit, without driving our own agenda.</p>",

I&rsquo;m not talking about gratitude for the wonderful opportunities I&rsquo;ve been offered; the doors that have been opened for me; or amazing family, friends, and colleagues. These things are easy to be grateful for. I&rsquo;m talking about reflecting with gratitude on the mistakes I&rsquo;ve made, the massive failures I have experienced, the friends that turned out not to be so friendly, and the graveyard of skeletons in my closet. For every bone, every failure, and every mistake has contributed to my becoming the person I am today.</p><p> Thinking back on every wrong turn I have taken, poor choice I have made, and, what I thought at the time, were life destroying events, I am amazed that I am where I am today; stronger, wiser, and better than ever. These events did not destroy me, on the contrary, they have created a wonderful life for me and made me into a pretty darn good person, even if I do say so myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade who I am to be anyone else in the world.</p><p> Yes, sometimes I have taken the rough road and had to learn my lessons the hard way. But, then again, what better way is there?

    "content": "<p> Dear friend and fellow human being,I have had the privilege to live in four countries so far in my life. Although I became a US citizen in 2009, I see myself as a global citizen and I am thankful for being able to experience many cultures and have a unique vantage point to do the work I do in the world. As American Thanksgiving nears this week, I feel a huge sense of gratitude for the freedom that we have and the abundant choices we have.I have much to be thankful for in every aspect in my life. What I want to share with you is the gift that I have been given to do my life's work, which is what I am celebrating this year.Being an entrepreneur is risky but I have learned that being safe is also very risky at times. I have spent the last five months of my life interviewing 21st century leaders for Our Journey to Business Common Sense and weaving their stories. I have been in awe of the generosity and vulnerability that they have shared with us so openly. And most meaningful to me has been their trust in me to tell their stories.I am taking special care in birthing this book as I feel it is a movement for us to see business as a force of good in the world.Business is fairly new and we have the opportunity to shape it and create a more humane environment for all of us and future generations.A big lesson that I have learned is around co-creation with likeminded souls. There is so much that is possible when we come together around a shared purpose. I am thrilled to be sharing real life stories of these 21st century leaders in my keynotes and workshops.It is a dream to be able to help so many people not only find their voice but also build thriving 21st century organizations. We have to re-invent our organizations so they invest more in creating shared value for the planet too.One of my goals for 2016 is to connect with more people around the world so please let me know if you want to have a conversation or if someone in your community would benefit from us connecting. I will tell the stories of what is possible through the book and many keynotes, retreats and workshops around the world and listen and help leaders find the path to the new world of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.london.edu/lbsr/achieving-lifeworks?display=expanded\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LIFEworking  </a> </u> .We are on a mission to make change happen and I am thankful for those who want to join. There is this old technology called the two-way conversation that is making a come back so please reach out if you want to chat.If you are in the US, I wish you a happy and joyous Thanksgiving. If you are in another part of the world, I wish you bliss every day to celebrate this amazing gift we have called life.With deep gratitude and love,Ayelet</p>",

    "content": "<h3> There are people in my life that make me want to be a better person.  They&rsquo;re not perfect.  They too have grumpy days, bad hair days, self-doubting days.  They too are incredibly human, with all that entails.  But they are the leaders of leaders. </h3><p> <br/> They step up when nobody else does, without being asked.  They focus on whatcan be done, when the masses are focused on can&rsquo;t.  They are the people who light the way with their generous spirit.  Our organizations need more leaders like this.  Our communities need more leaders like this.  Our world needs more leaders like this.</p><p> My friend Alise is that kind of leader.  She never ceases to amaze me.  Alise sits on multiple non-profit boards, volunteers for every charitable event imaginable, speaks at conferences across the country, juggles her expanding business and family activities without breaking a sweat, runs, lifts weights, composts, remembers birthdays, has a PhD, cooks like a dream, is diplomatic, asks great questions and actually listens, is  humble, kind, thoughtful, genuine, powerful.   Oh, did I mention that she typically has anywhere from 20 &ndash; 60 people over for Thanksgiving every year?  She cooks 5- 6 turkeys, a ham (because &ldquo;Not everyone eats turkey, Honey&rdquo;), a vegetarian option (I&rsquo;m remembering a manicotti the year I got to partake), probably 15 side dishes, desserts, wine, a &ldquo;special holiday beverage&rdquo;.  You name it, she&rsquo;s thought of it.  It is breathtaking.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s what Alise does from a leadership perspective that makes such a difference in her results.  One Thanksgiving, when I was living in Dallas, I got lucky.  I was in on the &ldquo;behind-the-scenes-action&rdquo; that makes her soirees so wonderful.   Here&rsquo;s what I found to be her recipe for success:</p><h3> She was well prepared Alise left nothing to chance.  She thought through every detail &ndash; the right ingredients, the tools required, what guests might need and want, and what experience she wanted them to have from the moment they walked through the door until they departed.</h3><p> <br/> How often do we jump into meetings without having adequately prepared?  Or have conversations that go side-ways because we haven&rsquo;t thought through what the other person might want and need?  In OnStage Leadership we talk a lot about the difference between consciously choosing our actions vs. reacting to the world around us.  Choosing the right actions to get the right results requires preparation.</p><p> She delegated and then let go Because Alise was so well prepared, she had thought through all of the different tasks that needed to be done ahead of time.  She had assembled her team.  And she had set expectations appropriately (we all knew what we were in for, when her email went out detailing the day&rsquo;s to-do&rsquo;s).  She didn&rsquo;t waste anyone&rsquo;s time.  She matched our skills/talents to the different jobs (I am not ashamed to admit that I peeled 30 lbs of potatoes).  She appropriately matched the person to the task and then trusted us to get it done.   She held the vision, took charge of the things that required her expertise, and delegated the details.</p><p> Great leaders understand that if they want to accomplish great things, they can&rsquo;t get mired in the details.  If Alise had to spend her time peeling and chopping, she would either have to limit what could be done, expect it to take a lot longer, or know that it would have a tremendous impact on the quality of her results.  As leadership guru Warren Bennis once said, &ldquo;Failing organizations are usually over-managed and under-led.&rdquo;</p><p> She was in the trenches and expressed gratitude  I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed peeling potatoes so much in my life.  I watched people joyfully chopping green beans, setting up tables, moving couches, stirring hot pots, and tearing goodness-knows-how-many-loaves-of-bread into little chunks.  All the while, Alise made all of us feel like rock stars.  Alise.  Who was working harder than anyone in the room, took every opportunity to thank us.  She thanked us for being there.  She thanked us for helping.  She thanked us for our friendship.  Her spirit of gratitude was contagious.  I think it&rsquo;s safe to speak for everyone who helped out that day &ndash; we were all thankful to be there.  And wow, did we get a lot done!</p><h3> Imagine&hellip;working for an organization where everyone felt like rock stars and they were thankful to work their tails off.   What might be accomplished?</h3><p> <br/> This week I am thankful for the leaders of leaders.  The people out there inspiring us to be more that we thought we could be.  The people out there who carry a vision of what&rsquo;s possible, under impossible circumstances.  The leaders modeling the way.  The world needs more leaders like that.</p><p> Are you going to step up?</p>",

    "link": "the-growing-opportunity-in-cross-border-wealth-management-for-independent-financial-advisors",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> This article is the first in a series of industry content from Maxim Global Wealth Advisors designed to help financial professionals better understand the opportunities available in the cross-border financial planning marketplace.</p><h3> Globalization is increasing and the world is becoming ever more connected, driven by companies expanding globally, technology companies importing specialized talent and a growing open border policy by nations around the world.</h3><p> <br/> This globalization is also driving the growth of a large and underserved market niche for wealth management, known collectively as Cross Border Families, which is comprised of the following three sub-groups:</p><li> International professionals living in the U.S.</li><li> American expats</li><li> International families with assets in the U.S. <br/>  </li><p> These individuals and families have specialized needs and are subject to numerous and complex tax, legal, currency and planning issues. Furthermore, there are very limited financial planning and investing solutions available to this group, or professional advisors available with the knowledge, skills and experience needed to offer appropriate solutions.</p><p> The opportunity to serve these individuals and families is attracting attention due to the sheer size of the marketplace, however most advisors do not have the tax, legal or cross-border experience to provide a fiduciary experience. </p><h3> Most cross-border professionals with a connection to the U.S. feel extremely frustrated with the unique complexities brought on by the worldwide tax system of the U.S. and other countries. In addition, international financial institutions are hesitant to serve their citizens who have a connection to the U.S.</h3><p> <br/> This unique situation has led to an occurrence where cross-border professionals have very limited options for sensible investment and financial planning help.  Most investment firms and large banks (U.S. and foreign) choose to avoid this market completely because they are ill equipped and not staffed appropriately to service these clients.</p><p> The cross border niche is a growing and thriving market segment.   While there are few estimates that have been developed to quantify the total investible assets owned by this demographic, many industry experts believe it is in the trillions of dollars worldwide.</p><h3> What is contributing to this growth? </h3><p> <br/> There are a number of factors, however, Globalization is the driving force, with international corporations expanding overseas quickly, and as a result they are sending their executives to manage their international operations, and likewise bringing more talented professionals from their foreign operations back to the U.S.</p><p> Additionally, there is a strong magnet in the U.S. technology sector for global entrepreneurs, attracted by the opportunity to launch their new businesses in the thriving ecosystems of technology hubs in San Francisco, New York, Boston and other regions rich with technology talent and available start-up capital.  Some estimates show that as many as 50% of the founders of new Silicon Valley startups are foreign citizens.</p><p> The challenge and opportunity for the wealth management industry is that there is a lack of solutions for these investors.  Historically, brokers that are not skilled or knowledgeable about the proper tax implications, legal and titling issues, and appropriate investment knowledge, have serviced these investors, simply because they were the default option. </p><p> Compounding this lack of solutions is the movement by custodians and banks to exit this part of the industry due to the complexities involved, regulatory concerns and other issues.    New policies and procedures being put in place caused by new regulations are not allowing their advisors to service these accounts, and ultimately removing accounts that have a foreign address or a foreign citizen owner.</p><p> There is also the trend of growing government transparency and information sharing leading to new regulations and rules globally, causing the industry to increase their reporting by foreign financial institutions to identify all clients with a &ldquo;connection&rdquo; to the U.S. and report details of their financial holdings to the U.S. Treasury.  As a result, investors are rapidly changing their &ldquo;offshore&rdquo; and undisclosed accounts to &ldquo;onshore&rdquo; and fully disclosed accounts, all of which are rapidly contributing to the growth of investible assets of the cross border niche.</p><p> <strong>  There are three primary demographics within the cross border wealth management niche, which combined is estimated to number between 25 &ndash; 40 million individuals with as much as $6 trillion in U.S.-based investible assets, based on Maxim Global Wealth Advisors research. </strong></p><h3> Cross Border Professionals</h3><p> Foreign-born professionals living in the U.S., such as a high tech engineer from India working for a U.S. technology company.   These are foreign-born individuals who are well educated and work in a professional capacity in the United States.</p><p> There are estimated to be over 40 million adult foreign-born immigrants in the U.S. based on U.S. Census Bureau data.  Approximately 29%, or 11.6 million, have a bachelors degree or higher according to the Center for Immigration Studies. From a wealth management perspective that target market translates into a group who has income of greater than $100K per year or net assets greater than $500k.   Through that filter, the size of the market is approximately 10 &ndash; 15 million people.  When combined, the total investible assets are approximately $2 - $3 trillion, assuming average investable assets of $250k.</p><h3> Americans Living Abroad</h3><p> American expats are estimated to number over 8 million people, according to the State Department, AARO 2015 report.  Of these, about 3 million are considered to be working professionals or HNW retirees with income of more than $100k per year or net assets greater than $500k, according to research conducted by Maxim Global Wealth Advisors.  This segment represents between $500 billion to $1 trillion in investable assets, assuming average investable assets of $250k.</p><h3> Non-Resident Aliens</h3><p> Foreign citizens living outside the U.S., with no U.S. citizenship or residency, but with U.S. based financial assets.   This group represents a large population of foreign citizens living abroad who have assets in the U.S., either through having previously lived and worked here, from actively transferring funds into the U.S. for investment purposes, or from a cross border inheritance.</p><p> The size of this market is estimated to be 10 to 20 million people, based on estimates from Maxim Global Wealth Advisors.  This segment represents investable assets of between $1 -$2 trillion, assuming average investable assets of $100k.</p><p> A large percentage of this segment are foreign professionals who previously worked in the U.S. and accumulated certain financial assets that remain there even after they&rsquo;ve left the U.S., such as real estate, 401k and other qualified assets.</p><p> In our next article, we&rsquo;ll highlight the specific financial planning and wealth management needs of the cross border market.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> FINRA, together with the SEC and NASAA are on a joint mission to keep seniors and impaired adults from being financially abused. FINRA has proposed new rules that will allow a firm to put a temporary hold on financial transactions when abuse is suspected, and will allow the firm to contact a trusted other during this hold period.</h3><p> <br/> Where&rsquo;s the flaw? No rule yet mandates that every financial firm and every individual advisor obtain information for a trusted contact person for every client. Not only should this be required for all new accounts, it should be mandated that such trusted others be identified for every client over age 65. As the risk of dementia doubles approximately every five years after age 65, the reasons for the advisor to have someone to call when concerns arise is obvious.</p><p> As to the subject of the trusted other, the elder usually names an adult son or daughter as the trusted one. Sometimes that is all the information the advisor has. At the same time, the studies on elder financial abuse show us that family members are the most frequent abusers. Do you see the contradiction here? Every advisor should be required to obtain not only one &ldquo;trusted person&rdquo; but two or three so that if abuse is going on or seems to be a threat, the advisor can involve more than one person in the effort to stop it.</p><p> Another flaw in the proposed rule is that is it assumed that something helpful will occur during the hold period when the institution is excused from liability for not acting. But there is no clear evidence that either advisors or institutions are being trained to spot financial abuse warning signs before the money is all drained from the account. As we see it, the proposed rule focuses on doing something afterabuse is clear and the institution has &ldquo;a reasonable belief&rdquo; that financial abuse is occurring. We think the industry can do much better than reacting by being required to call someone after the client has been taken advantage of or had the portfolio plundered.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the truth: getting an unwilling aging person to step down from financial authority over his portfolio takes more than a few days or a couple of weeks. If there is a trust in place and the elder is the trustee, the terms often state that at least one doctor, or two must say that the client is no longer capable of handling financial matters. Getting a doctor or two to see the client, do an assessment and produce something in writing with the needed findings can take months. And we&rsquo;ve witnessed this exact scenario when it did take three months to oust the impaired, demented senior who wanted to give his predatory adult child a debit card for his cash management account.</p><p> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u> , where we educate both financial institutions and independent advisors about stopping financial abuse, we think the effort to keep elders financially safer needs to go to the front end of abuse, not the back end after it has happened. Proactive steps can be taken. We urge every financial professional to know the warning signs of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/?s=diminished+capacity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   diminished capacity  </a> </u>  so you can engage the trusted third party when the signs emerge, rather than waiting until someone, whether family or outside predator seizes the opportunity to exploit  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/?s=diminished+capacity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   diminished capacity.  </a> </u></p><p> To learn more about what you or your institution can do that we think is much better than simply being allowed to hold transactions for a bit when you believe abuse is going on, contact us at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aginginvestor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingInvestor.com  </a> </u> . We have an entire program outline ready for you with focus on prevention.</p><p> If your client is being manipulated, holding transactions when you&rsquo;re pretty sure it&rsquo;s gone on can do little to protect your client. The predators and thieves can empty an account faster than it would take you to fill out the forms FINRA will inevitably give you. Think the way you are trained to think about finances generally: plan ahead, anticipate problems before they get here, and take protective action.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you write content for the financial industry, you likely write for a mixed audience. Some of the people who read your content may be professional financial advisors. Others may be new investors who are still learning the basic concepts of investing. You can make your content more accessible to everyone by following a few plain language principles.</p><h3> The truth about plain language</h3><p> <br/> Some people think that plain language is about &ldquo;dumbing things down.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not. Plain language is about expressing yourself clearly and concisely without being condescending or making anyone feel dumb. What might make someone feel that way? Having to look up every fifth word they read in the dictionary or giving up on an article because it&rsquo;s too dense and exhausting.</p><p> Some people think that plain language is about &ldquo;dumbing things down.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not. Plain language is about expressing yourself clearly and concisely without being condescending or making anyone feel dumb.</p><p> Imagine a doctor who speaks like a medical textbook. Every other word they say is over your head and, despite asking good questions, you give up on having a meaningful conversation with them.</p><p> You know you&rsquo;re an intelligent person. But you&rsquo;re going to feel much less intelligent if your doctor insists on saying &ldquo;Choledocholithiasis&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;gallbladder stones&rdquo; and sighs when you ask them what that means. Especially since there&rsquo;s no reason for a doctor to avoid using a common and easily understood term like &ldquo;gallbladder stones.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Three elements of plain language </strong></h3><p> <br/> Without &ldquo;dumbing&rdquo; anything down, you can get your message across to a broader audience by focusing on these three things.</p><h3> 1. Organization</h3><p> Break your article into chunks so readers can scan it quickly and easily. This means using heads and subheads relevant to what you&rsquo;re about to say.</p><p> Make sure each paragraph focuses on a single topic. If you move onto a new topic, move onto a new paragraph, too. Readers find it easier to digest one main thought at a time.</p><h3> 2. Sentence and paragraph length</h3><p> Try to keep your sentences under 30 words and limit each paragraph to three to five sentences. If you have a long sentence that can&rsquo;t be broken up, try putting it into bullet points.</p><h3> 3. Word choice and style</h3><p> Write in a conversational tone and use active voice as much as you can. Avoid industry jargon that most people outside of your industry won&rsquo;t understand, and delete unnecessary words.</p><p> Avoid industry jargon that most people outside of your industry won&rsquo;t understand.</p><p> Choose familiar words over more obscure words, but don&rsquo;t avoid long words that would be easily understood by your audience just because they&rsquo;re long. Take a look back through this post and you&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;ve used some long words, but we&rsquo;re confident our audience will be fine with this.</p><h3> <strong>  A word on design </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a strong design element to plain language, which might be something you don&rsquo;t have much control over. However, using a readable font and including lots of white space will make your content easier to read.</p><h3> <strong>  Plain language in action </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s a short before-and-after example of the three elements of plain language in action.</p><h3> Before</h3><p> Despite a year filled with market and operational headwinds, much positive feedback was given to us by clients in recognition of the merit of our customer service, superior attention to detail and unyieldingly honest marketing campaigns.</p><h3> After</h3><p> Despite a challenging year, our clients told us they appreciated our commitment to customer service, attention to detail and honest marketing campaigns.</p><h3> What we did</h3><p> - Kept the sentence under 30 words <br/> - Used active voice <br/> - Deleted industry jargon <br/> - Deleted unnecessary words</p><p> Looking for a plain language expert who can work with you to improve your writing? </p>",

    "title": "Estate Planning Decisions",
    "link": "estate-planning-decisions",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> One of the reasons so many of us procrastinate when it comes to estate planning is a reluctance to think about death and dying. <br/>  </h3><p> Another reason that may be even stronger is the need to make decisions. It's not so hard to make an appointment with an attorney to draft a will. It's much harder to decide what the provisions of that will should be.</p><p> No wonder so many people take the simple approach of \"leave everything to my spouse and kids.\" That works perfectly well for many families. It's also pretty much what the probate code provides for if someone dies intestate.</p><p> But what if you don't have a spouse or kids? Or your kids are stepchildren? Or your only biological family is a handful of cousins you haven't seen in years? Or you own valuable heirlooms or artwork that no one in the family cares about?</p><p> In cases like these, it's especially important to stop procrastinating about estate planning decisions. Without a will, people close to you who are not blood relatives will inherit nothing. Possessions may be disposed of with little regard for their emotional, historical, or even financial value. Your assets may end up in the hands of distant relatives you've never met or even go to the state.  </p><p> If you don't want that to happen, but you still aren't sure what to do with all your stuff, here are a few ideas that might help you get started.</p><h3> 1. Consider the people close to you that you regard as family even though they may not technically be relatives.</h3><p> <br/> Besides stepchildren and grandchildren, this might include longtime friends, caregivers, or anyone else who is important in your life. If you'd like to leave inheritances to any of them&mdash;whether that might be a few pieces of inexpensive jewelry or a large sum of money&mdash;you need to make your wishes known through a will or other estate planning tools.  </p><h3> 2. Make charitable giving personal and meaningful.</h3><p> <br/> Think about what type of giving is most important to you, whether it might be helping the homeless, funding education or medical research, supporting the arts, or any of hundreds of worthwhile causes. Then consciously choose organizations with goals that match your own.</p><h3> 3. Feel free to be creative.</h3><p> <br/> Think about all the places where an unexpected bequest could help your community: libraries, community daycare centers, small museums, elementary schools, arts organizations, volunteer fire departments. Buy a park bench; give a piece of art to a hospital; donate your vintage record albums to a college music department. Have fun finding ways to leave small legacies.  </p><h3> 4. Build relationships with \"emotional heirs\" who share your interests in collections, antiques, tools, or other items or activities that have special meaning to you.</h3><p> <br/> This may give you a chance to pass your possessions on to someone who will appreciate them and who will also remember you through them.</p><h3> 5. Don't wait till you're gone.</h3><p> <br/> Consider donating collections or antiques to museums while you're still around to have some say in what's done with them. Think about giving personal possessions you value but don't necessarily use to someone who would appreciate them&mdash;while you are able to add to the value by sharing the stories behind those items.</p><p> Finally, remember to use and enjoy what you have. Ironically, thinking through those tough estate planning decisions can make us more aware of what is important&mdash;and what isn't&mdash;in the here and now. The most important question may be, not what to do with assets after we're gone, but what to do with them while we're still here.</p>",

We cautioned that &ldquo;it is not enough to simply ask questions, you have to be genuine in caring about her as a person. You have to listen, really listen and act on what she is telling you.&rdquo;</p><h3> We call this &ldquo;the art of mindful listening.&rdquo; And while we have blogged on &ldquo;listening&rdquo; before, it is such an important skill that we felt it was worth repeating.</h3>We all think we know how to listen. We shut our mouth, smile and maybe even nod for however long it takes for the other person to finish, at which point we usually launch into our own perspective of the issue &ndash; that is not listening.Consider the following exchange a friend recently related to me. The last time she met with her financial advisor, she told me, she was a bit down and he noticed. Somewhat uncharacteristically, upon being asked, she confided in him that she was a little jealous because her brother and his wife just got back from Spain, and she wished she could travel more.As she told me the story, I remember thinking, &ldquo;good on him for noticing she was down and asking the question.&rdquo;  Unfortunately he blew it with his response. First, he told her about his brother and how he travels a lot too. Then, he went into the details of an ill-fated trip he and his buddies took to Spain in university and then made a dumb joke about it being safer and cheaper to camp in the back yard anyway. After which, pulling out his charts and performance tables, he said, rather officiously, in her opinion, &ldquo;so shall we get down to business now.&rdquo;<h3> This is a good example of how not to listen.</h3>He missed a perfect opportunity to connect with her on a human level and to connect her money to the life she hoped for herself. He could have asked more questions to find out if she really wanted to travel and he could have suggested that together they could work on a plan that would allow her to travel in the future.As it was, he not only didn&rsquo;t make her feel any better, he effectively &ldquo;lost her&rdquo; two weeks later when he presented a template financial plan that was all about the growth of her assets and had nothing to do with the life she wanted to live. She has since switched advisors.<h3> Take away</h3><strong> When a woman tells you something, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s important to her.</strong>Find ways to incorporate her &ldquo;wishes&rdquo; into the financial plan you&rsquo;re creating. At the very least ask, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I work out a couple of options for your financial plan that would allow you to travel more?&rdquo; And watch her eyes light up. Now that&rsquo;s connecting financial assets to real life.Learn how to<b> Retain Female Clients</b>through this online course and earn CE credits.

    "content": "<h3> I know, we&rsquo;ve already been through this objection, but sales reps always want more input on it so here it is:</h3><p> <br/> The bottom line is that when someone says they want to think about it, it means they aren&rsquo;t sold yet.  And it could very easily mean that they aren&rsquo;t sold on your solution, and they never will be because they have something else in mind. </p><p> Your job is to either get to that hidden objection and learn what you need to do to overcome it, or get your prospect to reveal why they aren&rsquo;t going to go with your product or service. </p><p> And that&rsquo;s why you must get your prospect talking.  Now here is why this is so hard for sales people: They don&rsquo;t want to ask because they don&rsquo;t want to know!  Most sales reps would just prefer to let the prospect &ldquo;think about it&rdquo; hoping they will somehow convince themselves and buy at some time in the future. </p><h3> How often does that happen?</h3><p> <br/> What usually happens is that the prospect then disappears at this point, never to be heard from again.  And that&rsquo;s why sales reps dread this objection.</p><p> But top producers know that getting their prospect talking at this point is crucial to find out one of two things (and both of these things is a successful outcome):</p><h3> 1. What the hidden objection really is, and so find a way of dealing and overcoming it, or:</h3><h3> <br/> 2. What the reason is they aren&rsquo;t going to move on it, and so be able to hang this up as a learning experience and use the lessons to qualify the next lead better.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Let me repeat &ndash; BOTH of these outcomes should be considered a success.  </strong> The first because you&rsquo;ll learn what you need to do to get a deal, and the second because you won&rsquo;t start chasing an unqualified lead that will never buy, and you&rsquo;ll learn how to not create another one in the future. </p><p> So the following ten rebuttals to &ldquo;I want to think about it&rdquo; are designed to get your prospect talking &ndash; and then you&rsquo;ll be able to decide which category they go into&hellip;</p><p> [Note: I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t emphasize again that you should have avoided this objection from coming up in the first place by asking this type of qualifying question during your initial call:  &ldquo;And if you like what we have to offer, what would be your timeframe for getting started?&rdquo;]</p><h3> Objection: &ldquo;I want to think it over&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Option 1: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand.  Just out of curiosity:</p><li> &ldquo;Do you understand how the (explain the benefits of savings or making money here) work right?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;And do you understand what we mean when we say, (stress any warranties guarantees or customer service options) here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Then while we&rsquo;re on the phone together, what other questions do you have?&rdquo;</li><p> [If None]</p><p> &ldquo;Then just to clarify my thinking, what part of this do you need to think over?</p><p> <strong>  Option 2: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Are you going to be thinking over the (name two or three benefits) we spoke about today or about whether or not this solution is the right fit for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 3: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve given you a lot to think about today, do you mind me asking what part of this you&rsquo;d like to think over?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 4: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got other options to consider&hellip;do you mind if I ask how we&rsquo;re stacking up to what you&rsquo;re also looking at?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 5: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;__________, it sounds like you&rsquo;re probably considering other options as well &ndash; do you mind if I ask who else you&rsquo;re looking into?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer:</p><p> &ldquo;And how do we stack up compared to them?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 6: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;__________, besides yourself, who else would be weighing in on this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 7: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I totally understand, many people I speak with want to consider all their options before making a decision.  Tell me, who else is in the running for this?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 8: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no problem.  Level with me, if you would, what would be holding you back from saying yes right now?&rdquo;</p><p> Layer:</p><p> &ldquo;And is this even a realistic option for you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 9: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;And as you think about it right now, what would be the major reason for not moving forward with it?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Option 10: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand &ndash; not everyone I speak with is ready to move forward with it right away.  Quick question:</p><p> &ldquo;What would you need to see here for you to say yes to this?&rdquo;</p><p> As you can see, all of these responses are geared to get your prospect to reveal what it&rsquo;s going to take for you to get the sale &ndash; and some are also geared to get your prospect to reveal why they will never be a deal.</p><p> Again, either way you win.</p><p>  </p>",

In some ways, FutureAdvisor&rsquo;s service is similar to other offerings on the market, in that it uses algorithms to optimize the portfolio for a potential customer. It offers free services around portfolio optimization and the aggregation of investment data into a single source. Should a customer want FutureAdvisor to actually execute an investment strategy, the company can do that&mdash;and indeed expect that service to provide a good chunk of its services.On August 26, 2015, FutureAdvisor signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by BlackRock, a global leader in investment and risk management.<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/9.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"FutureAdvisor\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/9.png\"/></a> <h3> <strong>  10.

    "content": "<h3> Strategy.</h3><p> <br/> Probably the most misunderstood concept in business. Especially in professional services.</p><p> Guess what happens in professional services then?  Businesses get busy without having a clear strategy&hellip;and as a consequence are continually busy doing and creating systems and processes, but never feel like they are really getting any closer to achieving their goals.</p><h3> The business often has a Vision. A clear picture of what it wants to look like, and what success means to the owners.</h3><p> <br/> The business often is excellent at Operational Planning. Perhaps because we are trained as planners there is a tendency to gravitate straight from Vision to Operational Planning.  Many professionals move straight to working out details of the tasks and projects that need to be done, but without a clear idea of what their competitive strategy is or why they are doing some of the things they are doing.</p><p> Strategy (if we strip out all the jargon) is simply: What is your cunning idea for achieving the goal?</p><p> The best, and most famous, example of strategic clarity in this part of the world was demonstrated many years ago by Sir Peter Blake when leading an America&rsquo;s Cup yachting challenge.  He reduced the entire campaign to a simple idea: &ldquo;to win, we need the fastest boat.&rdquo;  Every &ldquo;business&rdquo; decision in the lead up to the campaign and through the regatta was tested with a simple question: Does it make the boat go faster?</p><p> This testing question was applied to everything from crew selection, to boat design, through to tactical decisions.  To achieve the vision the strategy was simple: Make the boat go faster. <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/download.png?w=610\"/></p><h3> Good strategy is what guides and shapes business decisions to ensure that the business resources are actually being focussed on doing the right things right.</h3><p> <br/> Working recently with a very good professional services firm which has built a very good business by most people&rsquo;s measures provided a typical example of the difference that strategic clarity makes.  In their case they are going through another rapid (and aggressive) growth phase, which is presenting a few challenges.  For years there has been a relentless focus on operational excellence, and they do many things very very well.  Some of those things which they do very well do not however lead them any closer to achieving the vision&hellip;.yet they have continued doing them anyway.  In effect they had hit a bit of a wall, simply because they were doing a lot of the wrong things right.</p><h3> Were they making the boat go faster?</h3><p> <br/> No.  They were loading the boat with excess&hellip;.excess people&hellip;excess processes&hellip;..excess infrastructure&hellip;.the boat was slowing down and struggling to regain momentum of any consequence.</p><p> Grand Vision coupled directly with Operational excellence, but lacking a clear strategy, resulted in chaotic busy-ness. The boat was going in circles slowly.</p><p> In this example their vision was clear. They are positioning for exit (retirement), and essentially the vision is to finish building a scalable and diversified advice business which is attractive to larger entities.  The keys to making it attractive and achieving the Vision were therefore having proven systematic solutions to key distribution issues:  recruitment/succession, training, compliance, sales performance and marketing systems, and so on, which can be replicated and duplicated profitably.</p><p> The struggle for this business is that they they hadn&rsquo;t achieved clarity on the strategy, so became consumed with having systems and processes for everything imaginable.  Even systems and processes which nobody else would really want or value.  Processes had processes.  The essential part of the strategy which had been missed was &ldquo;which can be replicated and duplicated profitably&rdquo;.</p><p> To define it at its most simple level, the strategy here is to create systems that someone else will pay a ton of money for because they can use it to fix their issues in a much larger business.  A larger entity will buy this business because it is cheaper than them having to figure out how to design all these remarkable systems and processes themselves.  That&rsquo;s the end game here. It follows that the testing question is:</p><h3> &ldquo;is this something that someone else will pay a ton of money for?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s the &ldquo;does it make the boat go faster?&rdquo; question for this service business.  It aligns the objectives of the business (the Vision) with the Operational decision making and allocation of resources and effort.  It gets the business focussing the talent, time and money on only working on what is valuable to the eventual buyer.  You know you have it right when you can come up with a simple &ldquo;testing question&rdquo; that reflects the strategy.</p><p> Suddenly decision making got a lot easier.  Suddenly figuring out what systems or processes mattered became a lot clearer.  Suddenly everyone had the same decision-making framework.  Suddenly all effort was focussed on achieving the vision, instead of just being busy creating superb stuff that nobody would ever really want.</p><h3> Strategy suddenly made sense.</h3><p> <br/> Strategic clarity is often the missing ingredient in otherwise great advice businesses.  It is the cunning idea that unites operational planning and execution with the achievement of the grand plan.  Without clear strategy good businesses generally just stay good instead of being great, simply because they are busy being busy on stuff that doesn&rsquo;t actually get them closer to the goal.</p>",

You&rsquo;re giving samples of your expertise and strategic thinking. And there is the added benefit of third-party endorsement.</p><p> There&rsquo;s tremendous value when a prospect says, &lsquo;I saw you on cable. I saw you in The Times.&rdquo; So if you&rsquo;re wondering why  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your competitor down the street is regularly mentioned in the paper and others barely know your office exists  </a> </u> , I&rsquo;ve prepared seven steps you can take to put your name in the public&rsquo;s eye.</p><h3> #1 Know Thyself</h3><p> Before offering yourself as an expert, be sure you truly are one. Don&rsquo;t try to be an authority on every financial planning issue. Two to three areas are usually enough.</p><h3> #2 Know the Media</h3><p> Learn which media is important to your clients. Do they prefer the local paper&rsquo;s financial columnist or are they Power Lunch viewers. This will help you refine your media outreach efforts.</p><h3> #3 Identify the Writers</h3><p> At each outlet you target there will be writers/editors specializing in business areas. Learn which writers or editors cover the areas you wish to promote. At radio or at cable stations this person will be a producer.</p><h3> #4 Have News</h3><p> Hard news is always easier to promote than soft features. Should there be something new that impacts a publication&rsquo;s readership, send a friendly e-mail to the right reporter or editor. After explaining why it&rsquo;s important, offer yourself as someone who can provide commentary on the issue.</p><h3> #5 It&rsquo;s Not Your Commercial</h3><p> Providing editorial commentary is not an opportunity to tell the world how great you are. You&rsquo;re being called upon to provide objective, unbiased insight.</p><h3> #6 Be Kind</h3><p> Do not use the media to disparage competitors and/or former partners and associates in even the slightest way. It usually backfires.</p><h3> #7 Be Honest</h3><p> Should a reporter call, be courteous, honest and respect their deadlines. If you&rsquo;re not comfortable or qualified to respond let the reporter know. Providing incorrect or misleading information will do more harm than good.</p><p> Still not convinced on the power of media relations? Consider that if reporters are not calling you, then they&rsquo;re calling someone else. Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather see your name in the paper than a competitor&rsquo;s?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I am fond of the phrase, &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t making mistakes you aren&rsquo;t trying hard enough.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> And here&rsquo;s the best proof of what can happen as long as one isn&rsquo;t afraid of making a mistake. Take it from some of the most successful in their field over the last century:  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Steve Jobs </strong> , <strong> </strong> co-founder of the original Apple computer, who was fired from the firm.</p><p> <strong>  Thomas Edison </strong> , inventor, who had 10,000 failed trials with his light bulb.</p><p> <strong>  Stephen Spielberg </strong> , movie director, went solo after being rejected three times from the University of California.</p><p> <strong>  Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg </strong> , both college-dropouts, went on to&hellip;.well you know what.</p><p> In elementary school, kids are taught the value of participation not only in the classroom, but in the outfield. However, as we get older, winning seems to be everything. Greed, competition, doing so at all cost, not willing to take risks, and not sharing solutions with our colleagues. But here&rsquo;s the thing: in business, there&rsquo;s this  &ldquo;zero-sum game&rdquo; theory which states that for one to win, another must lose. It&rsquo;s the idea behind most sports, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be the idea behind business. My point is that when one is in business, making situations a win-win can be possible.</p><p> For example, I was once charged with implementing the sale of a complicated business that was losing money and not a part of our key strategy. Our chairman made a deal with the buyer at dinner which only included the price and the instructions to do it as fairly and quickly as possible.</p><p> We came back the next day with lots of information about where we could increase our profit which was just as important as the purchase price. He and the buyer simply said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bother us, just find fair solutions.&rdquo; That guidance forced both parties to resolve numerous issues quickly and fairly, and complete a transaction that truly benefited both parties.  <br/> There are a variety of tools to make situations more win-win:</p><h3> Goals and Needs:</h3><p> The simplest technique is to understand the needs and goals of your partners in a relationship. In particular, ask and understand the importance of price, service, quality, and reliability in that relationship. The mindset behind buying a car is a far different than buying a cheap umbrella in a sudden downpour.</p><h3> Increase the value of the total rewards:</h3><p> A simple tool to increase the pie is to try out different strategies in pricing, how the product is delivered, and its quality. If these strategies are a cooperative decision, then as a group, modifications can be made as needed. Everyone wins!!</p><h3> Restructure the relationship: </h3><p> If you communicate with your partners, then lots of win-win consequences can occur. In my own experience, sharing forecasts, production plans, inventory quantities, and the like, is one of the easiest and most inexpensive tools with the greatest of outcomes.</p><h3> Be More Open: </h3><p> Organizations need to be open to measurement and feedback. Observing, understanding and sharing financials, operations reports, and sales reports are the first step. Simple research studies that social media can provide are tools to use regularly. A management style such as the &ldquo;walk around&rdquo; and asking simply, &ldquo;how are you doing, is there anything you need?&rdquo; can be priceless.</p><h3> Open Communication:</h3><p> You need a commitment to open communication. One of the investors on the &ldquo;Shark Tank &ldquo;TV program had simple advice for an entrepreneur who wouldn&rsquo;t stop talking: <strong>  Stop talking and listen! </strong></p><p> In summary, we need to change the paradigm of win-lose to win-win. That requires that we take different perspectives, encourage innovation (embracing mistakes that may arise) and improve communications with suppliers, colleagues, customers, and, yes, even competition.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a brand and why do we want it?&rdquo;</h3>Have you seen <u> <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3095080/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Happyish </a></u>? Critics have murdered it but some parts are absolutely worth watching. There is a scene in the pilot that says it all when it comes to branding and if I were not terrified of copyright laws I&rsquo;d show it to you. The main character, Thom, is an ageing advertising executive with a cynical aversion to change not even his Prozac can mitigate. One day he finds his boss watching the news, in awe at how Isis are &ldquo;excellent marketeers&rdquo; having established themselves in the public eye in a few years and he objects &ldquo;AlQuaeda is not a brand, it&rsquo;s a terrorist organisation!&rdquo; to which he receives the following response: &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s a brand, Thom. I&rsquo;m a brand; you&rsquo;re a brand. God&rsquo;s a brand. And a brand in trouble.&rdquo;<img alt=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/17.png \" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/17.png ?w=565&amp;h=486\"/>In my former job I was briefly our &ldquo;VP of Brand Strategy&rdquo; and I loved that title because to me that translated into &ldquo;keeper of our soul&rdquo; although the topic of &ldquo;What exactly is a brand?&rdquo; came up despite our agile, FinTech-y size. We too had investors and boards who wanted to know what brand really was. There are many definitions to show how it&rsquo;s the sum total part of all the experiences connected to a company&rsquo;s products, employees, physical presence, and so on and there are -thankfully- numerous studies to link ROI to brand development. In reality &ldquo;Branding&rdquo; is still a largely unstudied topic with psychological and sociological ramifications we have not yet fully explored in any industry but the best way to describe it in my opinion, is that your brand should be everyone&rsquo;s perception of you and if you are authentic it will be a mirror of your soul. If that&rsquo;s awesome enough &ndash; you get irrationally dedicated, loyal, fans. That simple.And that <u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2015/02/13/apples-119-billion-asset-hidden-in-plain-sight/\" target=\"_blank\">  pays. </a></u><h3> &ldquo;Are there banks who are brands?&rdquo;</h3>Now surely, with the amount of Irrational Bank Loyalty TM that&rsquo;s so clear in the Financial Services industry where switching rates are shamefully low no matter what we try, and the average UK marriage lasts 11 yrs while <u> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24123046\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the average bank relationship 17 </a></u>, banks get how important having a strong brand is and invest billions in getting those fans, right? Wrong.It&rsquo;s undeniable that banks have a certain amount of brand capital despite their customers&rsquo; protestations, there is enough emotional attachment to keep us hooked for reasons I&rsquo;ll elaborate on in another post, but all that&rsquo;s accidental not intentional, cultivated and earned.We all understand that being a brand pays yet how many of the banks in Europe even think in terms of being a brand? I can only see three. Yes you read that right &ndash; THREE. One of them is mBank who spent inordinate amounts of time wondering how to make their consumers truly fall in love with them when they built their golden standard in digital proposition from scratch, the other one is a constantly NPS (Net Promoter Score) obsessed ING (in particular in Spain) and the most successful one, the only one which recognises being a brand is valuable, desirable and necessary is CheBanca! where Roberto Ferrari&rsquo;s team has achieved the impossible &ndash; became a Superbrand and won awards over the likes of BMW or Nike in Italy despite being a bank.<img alt=\"\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-29-at-9.49.56-AM.png\" width=\"850\"/>click to viewHow did that video make you feel? A bit like you&rsquo;re cheating on your dreary day job of being a serious banker, right?&ldquo;Despite&rdquo; is the key word there. Banks are often mistaken for being arrogantly uninterested in making their clients love them because the cogs turn with our without their love, where else would they keep and get their money? I am not sure I agree it&rsquo;s all down to arrogance.  I&rsquo;m sure some eye rolling did happen when any bankers from the dreaded 3-4 top ones read the examples above as those are &ldquo;new&rdquo; or &ldquo;digital&rdquo; or &ldquo;small&rdquo; &ndash; all the excuses we&rsquo;ve heard about brand-makers before so yes, there is some element of corporate inertia at play but I&rsquo;d argue banks have an inferiority complex. The same one disallowing them from wondering about what it is that the consumer feels, a type of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no Apple or Disney, what are the odds I&rsquo;ll double my value just by having consumers adore me?&rdquo;. The banks I cited above did not have this inferiority complex they found out what consumers love and gave it to them.&ldquo;But where would I even start building a brand?!?&rdquo;<h3> Granted it&rsquo;s not easy. Marketing wise there&rsquo;s only so much Pintrest you can do when you sell loans.</h3>Physically &ndash; selling great tasting coffee in funky cups with some experience thrown in is indeed a far more addictive proposition than having someone come in to cash a check. Entering a Burberry concept store is indeed a day out and no matter which agency sanctions the walls&rsquo; colour, a branch is still a branch and short of offering people a champers glass, canapes, a massage while they wait and smart phone charging stations (which must be illegal somehow or all bank branches would give us more than lollypops and dog food) it&rsquo;s hard to make it fun and memorable while still retaining purpose &ndash; just ask the creators of the de-facto Internet Cafe Branch of a few years ago.Which leaves us with digital. That&rsquo;s where banks can build the much needed Brand Esteem &ndash; it&rsquo;s most important equity &ndash; the part that reflects how consumers feel about it. This isn&rsquo;t new, it is instinctively why every bank worth its salt has been designing, implementing and transforming digital strategies nearly exclusively focused on the front-end reimagining what they package online and on the mobile in the past few years because it&rsquo;s the one area where magic can happen at the experience level, but they&rsquo;ve done so mechanically, on paper, without brand building at heart.For many banks, in the absence of the deep cultural realisation that they need to transform from a faceless service provider to a beloved brand, this effort of redesigning the mobile and online offering has turned out to be an effort of doing what I call &ldquo;Design-experience-by-numbers&rdquo; instead of its much more powerful and lasting counterpart &ldquo;Design-experience-by-feeling&rdquo; where you create truly emotionally connected consumers &ndash; brand fans and not solely less dissatisfied users.This needs to change. And soon. I need more of the Challenger Banks talking about being a brand (Starling has done so, a couple of others did too but it&rsquo;s not enough yet), more of the big incumbents talking about passion scale and addiction potential and I need more FinTech to define itself as &ldquo;Brand Empowering&rdquo; if their offering is to banks and will indeed make consumers fall in love and get NPS to jump through the roof. (BTW if you&rsquo;re a bank reading this and don&rsquo;t use NPS stop making ridiculous excuses for why not and change that.)While there is a lot more to say on this, there&rsquo;s one thing we all know for sure &ndash; banks acutely need to become brands before the brands decide to become banks.",

How is it different?</li><li> <strong>  While growing up what people in your life influenced you to choose a career in this industry? </strong> What about them motivated you? How is your thinking similar to theirs? How is it different? <br/>  </li><p> Birds of a feather flock together. By understanding the people that current employees and future employees &ldquo;flock&rdquo; with, you gain greater insight into their motivations.</p><li> <strong>  Do their motivations align with whom you want for people in your organization? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Can you match job activities to satisfy the motivations of current and new team members? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> You can continue to conduct business as usual by asking yourself &ldquo;How do I motivate people to do X-Y-Z?&rdquo; Or, you can eliminate the guesswork and actually learn what motivates them by asking directly, <strong>  &ldquo;What do you need in order for me to support you to do your best work?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

    "content": "<p> First of all, what is a smart city? &ldquo;A smart city gathers data from smart devices and sensors embedded in its roadways, power grids, buildings and other assets,&rdquo; describes Jon DeKeles of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://smartcitiescouncil.com/article/our-vision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smart Cities Council  </a> </u> . &ldquo;It shares that data via a smart communications system that is typically a combination of wired and wireless. It then uses smart software to create valuable information and digitally enhanced services.&rdquo; The Council&rsquo;s goal is to &ldquo;create smart, sustainable cities with high-quality living and high-quality jobs,&rdquo; he writes.And depending on whom you ask, the smart city may go beyond even that. &ldquo;A smart city happens when  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/we-cant-allow-the-tech-giants-to-rule-smart-cities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   three specific networks interact  </a> </u> : the communications grid, the energy system and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/what-is-the-internet-of-things-google\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the so-called &ldquo;logistics internet&rdquo;  </a> </u> &ndash;which can track people and things through transport and supply systems,&rdquo; writes Paul Mason in The Guardian. &ldquo;In a smart city, you need data to flow freely across sectors that, in the commercial world, would normally be separate. The energy system needs to know what the transport system is doing.&rdquo;What makes this important? Because, increasingly, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/7/188741-the-new-smart-cities/fulltext\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   world&rsquo;s people are living in cities  </a> </u>  and the world&rsquo;s economy is driven by them. &ldquo;More than half of the world&rsquo;s population currently lives in or around a city,&rdquo; writes Gregory Mone in Communications of the ACM. &ldquo;By the year 2050, the United Nations projects another 2.5 billion people could be moving to metropolises.&rdquo; In the future, cities are expected to account for nearly 90 percent of global population growth, 80 percent of wealth creation, and 60 percent of total energy consumption, according to  <u>  <a href=\"http://cities.media.mit.edu/about/cities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MIT&rsquo;s City Science program  </a> </u> . Similarly, about 80 percent of global GDP is generated in cities&ndash;&ldquo;driven by a mixture of urbanization, geographic sprawl and concentrated zones of innovation,&rdquo; Mason writes.At the same time, cities are often the biggest source of environmental issues, so efforts to reduce their impact can have  <u>  <a href=\"http://newclimateeconomy.net/content/press-release-low-carbon-cities-are-us17-trillion-opportunity-worldwide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   big payoffs  </a> </u> . &ldquo;Investing in public and low emission transport, building efficiency, and waste management in cities could generate savings with a current value of US$17 trillion by 2050,&rdquo; according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.Solving the environmental challenges are a big reason why countries such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.chinabusinessreview.com/smart-city-development-in-china/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/Will-the-smart-cities-projectbring-in-job-opportunities-at-whatscale-and-in-which-sectors/articleshow/49552720.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   India  </a> </u> , with large, growing populations and economies, have been the quickest to embrace the smart city concept. Since 2013, 193 cities or city districts in China have developed plans to set up a smart city pilot, while in 2015, the Indian government announced that it would invest in 100 smart cities, according to Tom Saunders and Peter Baeck in their report,  <u>  <a href=\"https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/rethinking_smart_cities_from_the_ground_up_2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rethinking Smart Cities From the Ground Up  </a> </u> . The U.S. has also launched a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help\" target=\"_blank\">   $160 million smart city initiative  </a> </u> .Originally, smart cities were intended to be built from the ground up, sort of like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.simcity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SimCity  </a> </u>  in real life. But proponents soon discovered that didn&rsquo;t work. &ldquo;Many of the champions of these early smart cities were IT companies who knew a lot about advanced networking technologies and data analytics but little about how cities work, which is why they focused on building new cities from scratch rather than engaging with the issues actual cities face,&rdquo; Saunders and Baeck write. &ldquo;However, critics showed how impractical it would be to apply technology developed for utopian visions to real&ndash;world cities.&rdquo;Some of the issues smart cities have to deal with aren&rsquo;t all that different from the ones any company has to deal with, such as knowing what technologies to invest in, Saunders and Baeck write. For example, while a  <u>  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/02/23/urban-design-internet-of-things/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_reader=feedly#idKYakjA9PqJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   network of sensors  </a> </u>  embedded in roads and sidewalks could provide useful information, it could be more useful to first figure out what sort of problems the sensors could help solve. Moreover, upkeep and maintenance could make the project cost more than it saves, they explain.Similarly, smart cities struggle with silos and integrating information from different sources&mdash;just like companies&mdash;and there&rsquo;s more to it than just integrating technology. &ldquo;London, for example, has 33 boroughs that all generate their own data but share little of it with each other,&rdquo; Saunders and Baeck write.  &ldquo;While data integration can bring huge benefits, it requires significant changes in culture, as well as city staff who understand how to interpret findings. However, in the smart city, data integration often becomes more about multi&ndash;million pound city control rooms rather than addressing difficult issues around skills and culture.&rdquo;And, of course, there&rsquo;s the  <u>  <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/12/building-smart-city-security/?ncid=rss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   security  </a> </u>  issue to deal with. What happens if your smart city goes down, gets hacked, or  <u>  <a href=\"https://placesjournal.org/article/smart-cities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   has a bug  </a> </u> ? &ldquo;Cloud-computing outages could turn smart cities into zombies,&rdquo; warns  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.govfresh.com/2014/10/big-vendors-civic-hackers-future-smart-cities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Anthony Townsend  </a> </u>  inPlaces Journal.Ultimately, smart cities have some of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vala-afshar/smart-cities-start-with-s_b_8332816.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   same challenges that any company does  </a> </u> , such as making sure to fit new technology into workflows and using systems that can communicate with each other, Saunders and Baeck write. &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://gcn.com/articles/2015/03/05/elgin-811-cloud.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cities must become more like technology companies  </a> </u> &mdash;developing technology roadmaps, partnerships and key deliverables that advance the quality of life for their citizens,&rdquo; writes Dan Ault, senior management analyst for the city of Elgin, Ill.Moreover, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dustinhaisler.com/smart-cities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   most critical component of any smart city  </a> </u> &mdash;and one that often gets neglected&mdash;is its people, writes Dustin Haisler, Chief Innovation Officer for e.Republic. &ldquo;People are the smartest aspect of any city and are capable of far more than simply living in it.&rdquo;Most of all, experts agree, cities need to make sure they get their opinions of their &ldquo;users&rdquo;&mdash;the citizens. After all, that&rsquo;s just smart.</p>",

    "link": "preparing-for-any-client-meeting",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> A client meeting doesn&rsquo;t start when you walk in the door and say good morning to your client. Rather, it should begin a day or two earlier, as you mentally prepare and reflect on how to make that meeting a success for both of you.</h3><p> <br/> Too often we are preoccupied with a key message we&rsquo;re trying to deliver, a point of view we want to convince our client of, or an agenda that we&rsquo;re determined to get through at any cost. Such rigidity and lack of forethought can be disastrous. One client I know got a meeting, after waiting for months, with the CEO of a large Fortune-500 company. The senior executives representing this client were so focused on their own agenda that they missed valuable cues in the first five minutes of the meeting. They had failed to thoroughly research the CEO&rsquo;s agenda and history of public statements about the company&rsquo;s strategy. As a result, 25 minutes into a one-hour meeting, the CEO got up, told my client that the meeting was over, wished them luck, and left the room! Here are some suggestions for avoiding such an ignominious demise in any of your own client meetings:</p><p> <strong>  1. Have you spent as much time thinking about what your client is going to say as you have thinking about what you are going to say? </strong> Have you considered the different ways your client may react to your message?</p><p> <strong>  2. Have you put yourself in your client&rsquo;s shoes? </strong> What business or personal pressures is he/she feeling right now? How is his/her relationship with superiors, colleagues, and subordinates?</p><p> <strong>  3. Have you made a list of what you don&rsquo;t know about this client but would like to know? </strong> If it&rsquo;s a first meeting, have you found out everything you can about the individuals you&rsquo;ll be meeting with? Can you use this meeting as an occasion to become more knowledgeable about your client?</p><p> <strong>  4. Are you structuring the meeting to create a real dialogue with your client? </strong> This could mean having no written materials whatsoever&mdash;or, if you do, making sure you engage your client as you walk through the presentation, testing for understanding, agreement/disagreement, and corollary issues.</p><p> <strong>  5. For this client, what are the rational, political, and emotional implications of the issue at hand? </strong> Of your message?</p><p> <strong>  6. Your meeting has two objectives: </strong> to make progress against your client&rsquo;s business issue or need, and to develop/improve the relationship. How will you further both agendas?</p><p> <strong>  7. Are you focused on activities or inputs </strong> &mdash;on reports, hours billed, analytical formulas, deliverables, and so on&ndash;or are you constantly keeping the client&rsquo;s objectives and the value he/she seeks at the forefront of your discussions?</p><p> <strong>  8. Do you fully understand the perspectives of the various constituencies that surround your client? </strong> (e.g., senior management, subordinates, customers, capital markets, as well as different functions and organizational units?)</p><p> <strong>  9. Will you present yourself and your views in a way that reinforces your standing as a deep generalist </strong> &ndash;someone with outstanding expertise but also possessing a broad, top-management perspective and an understanding of the entire business &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; that surrounds your client?</p><p> <strong>  10. In your meeting, will you exhibit a mindset of &ldquo;independent wealth&rdquo;? </strong> (i.e., you are totally focused on your client&rsquo;s agenda, you demonstrate a love for your work, and you treat your client as an equal).</p><p> <strong>  11. If you are going to meet your client with other team members, have you: </strong></p><li> Established clear roles for everyone during the meeting?</li><li> Identified a colleague who will focus singularly on observing the meeting&rsquo;s interactions and taking detailed notes?</li><li> Thought through whether the mix of individuals you are bringing to the meeting makes sense and will provide a diversity of styles and approaches? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  12. Are you keeping in mind the behaviors that make us comfortable with any individual: </strong> praise, positive association, similarity, familiarity, openness, and rapport?</p><p> <strong>  13. Are you prepared to exercise a &ldquo;doubting mind&rdquo; </strong> &ndash;are you ready to question both your client&rsquo;s assumptions and your own assumptions? To reserve judgment about outcomes until you see the whole picture?</p><p> <strong>  14. Do you have an agenda and game plan for the meeting, and have you discussed this with your client ahead of time? </strong> Are you prepared to calmly abandon this agenda if your client wants to take the meeting in a different direction?</p><p> <strong>  15. Have you met or spoken with at least some of the clients who will be at the meeting, </strong> and socialized the information or conclusions that you&rsquo;ll be discussing in order to get their reactions and comments ahead of time?</p><p> <strong>  16. Whether this is the 10th or 100th meeting with this client, are you prepared to treat him/her like a brand new client? </strong> Are you bringing the same freshness, enthusiasm, and new ideas that you brought to the first or second meeting, when you were wooing this client?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Without a feminine compass, venturing into the lucrative market of women and wealth (while necessary for growth) can be dangerous, especially for male advisors.  Over the next decade, women will be the recipients of the greatest transference of wealth in our nation&rsquo;s history. </h3><p> <br/> While this shift presents an enormous opportunity for financial advisors, statistics tell us women are not happy with the financial services industry and this could lead to massive attrition.</p><p> <strong>  This combination of wealthy women and their less-than-stellar impression of financial advisors is already forcing changes within the financial industry. </strong>   According to The Gender Gap in Financial Literacy 2015 study, while more women are seeking retirement savings projections and utilizing asset allocation models than ever before, it seems they are doing so through their company retirement plans.  So why not through advisors?  Women&rsquo;s desire to plan and prepare for the future is natural to their nurturing and multi-tasking nature making them ideal candidates for financial advisors, yet there seems to be a disconnect.</p><p> The challenge for advisors today is that the approach that worked well for her husband, father or brother does not translate well for the wealthy woman who is representing her own interests, thus, change in the methods of effectively engaging women is eminent and necessary to future growth for advisors.</p><p> <strong>  Advisors today have two choices:   </strong></p><li> Embrace this shift by integrating a new, more feminine model for success leading the industry in attracting female clients and women-controlled assets</li><li> Or wait for massive attrition (women won&rsquo;t tell you they are not happy, they just leave) that will simply force change. <br/>  </li><h3> For many advisors&mdash; especially men&mdash;venturing into this untapped market can seem daunting, without a roadmap or feminine compass, trying to appeal to women has the potential to cause more harm than good.  </h3><p> <br/> While the desire to provide women with the environment they want may be sincere, the fear of potentially alienating women can prevent advisors from moving forward.</p><p> In reality, this fear can be real. Most women won&rsquo;t tell you they are not happy, they often won&rsquo;t say they felt disrespected, or that you are speaking over her head making her feel less than comfortable. No, she won&rsquo;t tell you, but she may tell all her friends and family about this one miserable experience potentially damaging your reputation.</p><h3> Achieving success in the women&rsquo;s market is not rocket science, but it does require a new approach that transforms the way you communicate and educate women. </h3><p> <br/> Prospecting, selling and closing while highly productive in a more masculine world does little to build productive relationship with women, often turning them off. A greater focus on building relationships, inspiring and motivating generates more positive and productive results with women.</p><p> Incorporating a more feminine business model, advisors are able to develop trusting relationships with women faster and more effectively. Using this new model, advisors begin to inspire women to consider other options and opportunities without selling her (which she abhors). And lastly, by implementing a more female approach advisors gain the skills necessary to motivate women by giving her a voice, listening to what is truly important to her and respecting her desire to become more confident in her journey toward financial independence.</p>",

    "link": "9-ways-to-help-your-children-during-the-holidays-post-divorce",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a child of divorce, I remember many holidays with my parents. Because my parents lived close to one another, traveling between the two houses (as well as two grandparents&rsquo; homes) were not all that difficult for my two siblings and myself. We would spend time with both parents on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, so holiday time didn't feel all complicated. I don't remember much strife between my parents. If there was &ndash; am I sure there was &ndash; they did a very good job of hiding it.</p><p> There is a level of undue pressure that is put on people to create happiness during the holidays. Yet, we all know it just doesn't always work out that way. Families come with a long history &ndash; both good and not so good. Divorced families have a whole other level of stress that is often part of the holidays. Divorce is difficult enough; add holiday time and everyone&rsquo;s stress increases.</p><h3> Here are 9 ways to make your holiday celebration time less stressful for you and your children.</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Stress awareness.</h3><p> Knowing that the holidays add a whole new level of stress beyond the day-to-day stress can help you plan better. Talk about it. Come up with a plan. Sometimes when we know that it will be difficult, we start thinking about how to reduce our stress. We don&rsquo;t deny, we just find ways to live with it.</p><h3> 2. It isn't about you.</h3><p> Remember that your children have two parents, and both of you are important to them. Spending time with the other doesn't mean they don't want to be with you &ndash; they&rsquo;re children! They want both of you. Don&rsquo;t take things so personally when they get upset or want to spend more time with their other parent. They are trying to figure things out, too. The holidays are for your children. This is hugely important to keep in mind.</p><h3> 3. You may need to adjust your expectations.</h3><p> Try to stay focused on your children's needs and how your decisions might be affecting their holiday time. Don&rsquo;t expect too much. Don&rsquo;t expect that they will be further along or happy with decisions. Although it is hard not to have expectations, we tend to get disappointed when we do. Have more of an open mind, especially if the divorce is new and/or this is your first holiday apart.</p><h3> 4. Decide on your plan before the holidays.</h3><p> By planning ahead and letting everyone know what the plans are in advance, everyone can be prepared. This is being proactive rather than reactive (the 'knee jerk' reaction is problematic). We become anxious when we don't know what's going on. People do better when they know what the plan is &ndash; even if they don't always agree with it.</p><h3> 5. Create new traditions as a new family.</h3><p> Your family is still your family &ndash; just defined a little differently. This might be a good time to 'shake things up' and make the holidays a little different. Sometimes keeping things the same &ndash; to the degree you can &ndash; is good, but sometimes a little change helps children recognize that a new tradition might be fun. Get them involved! Ask them what they might want to do differently. You might be surprised by their answers.</p><h3> 6. Keep the routine.</h3><p> As much as divorce (and life, for that matter) &ndash; is about change things, some routine and sameness for children is important. Too much change can overwhelm them. When deciding on your plans, think about what needs to change and what can stay the same. Even a little routine can help get you and your family over the hump.</p><h3> 7. Lighten up!</h3><p> Your kids will take cues from you. If you are stressed, angry, or bitter, they will feel those same feelings and be deeply affected by them. Manage your feelings effectively without burdening them. Turn to friends or family to help you through this time of year.</p><h3> 8. Validate and listen to their feelings.</h3><p> Children have their own journey through divorce just like you. They rely on both parents to be available to them, both emotionally and physically. Encourage them to open up and share their feelings &ndash; especially the guilt they often feel. They might have feelings about the happy holidays of yesteryear and want to know if they will be happy again during the holidays. Remember that they are still children &ndash; no matter their age or how 'mature' they may appear to be.</p><h3> 9. Stay flexible.</h3><p> Even we plan and hope for the best, things can go wrong. That&rsquo;s just life. But how you handle the ups and downs of life is key to surviving the already stressful holidays. How will you handle any changes? Are there other options? Ask, if I am not flexible, how will this affect my children?</p><p> Remember, going from being married to divorced is a major life transition. There is no way around that!</p><p> Levity, humor, flexibility, and the knowledge that we are all in this together and a work in progress that continues to evolve and grow will help you manage holiday time in a healthier!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What do clients really value the most?</h3>When I started my own firm almost four years ago, I spent a lot time asking myself and my fellow colleagues what clients really value the most. During conversations that I had with many wealthy individuals and investment professionals, I was routinely reminded of the following comment from a long-time client:\"Preston, I hired you to help our family develop and implement an investment plan. I am very happy with the management of our investments but do you know what I have come to realize that I really pay you for? Transparency, simplicity and peace of mind.\"This client's clear-eyed view of what was most important to him has stayed with me throughout the process of growing the firm. When my new partner and I were rebranding the firm Fiduciary Wealth Partners in early 2015, he and I decided to focus our approach on providing clients greater peace of mind by offering keep-it-simple investment solutions with full transparency.Fast forward to today and we are pleased to announce that we have been granted a registered trademark by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for<u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/transparency-fiduciary-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Transparency </a></u>,<u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/simplicity-wealth-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Simplicity </a></u>,<u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/fiduciary-peace-of-mind/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Peace of Mind </a></u>&reg;.As I have written about in a number of articles (some listed below), this idea has become central to our philosophy.<li> <u>  <a href=\"/advisor/absolute-value-and-transparency\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Absolute Value and Transparency  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"/advisor/whats-in-a-name\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   What's In A Name  </a> </u></li><li> <a href=\"/advisor/rock-science\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Rock Science  </u> </a></li>Related to simplicity, our investment process is focused on the consistent evidence that keep-it-simple index investment strategies often win.Index funds are not for everyone and we understand the argument for active management well (I spent over 20 years successfully selling active funds as a Managing Director of a large asset management firm).Beyond the merits of index versus active investments, however, we believe the wealth management business spends too much time and money promising relative outperformance. Considering how hard it is to deliver on these promises and the enormity of the resources (firm time and client fees) spent in pursuit of something that research indicates is very elusive, shouldn't we be focusing more on other things?Versus trying so hard to find and sell alpha, maybe the industry should be spending more time trying to understand clients' feelings about risk and reward (not just presenting output from questionnaires or Monte Carlo simulations). Maybe we should offer full transparency (openly discussing both sides of a trade, fully disclosing all fees and terms, potential biases and conflicts).How about just communicating using simple language so clients can genuinely understand their investments?  If so, maybe their greater understanding will help clients resist the urge to change course during short-term market corrections and instead stick to their long-term wealth plans.Investing should not be a competition, it should be a tool that enables an investor's achievement of specific, personal goals.Let's spend less time selling and sparring over relative performance and more time candidly discussing the pros and cons of issues important to our clients and their families.  How about listening not just to respond but to understand what clients want to achieve?  How about explaining what we can reasonably offer and, together with our clients, implementing strategies that increase comfort and peace of mind?At Fiduciary Wealth Partners, we believe that more time spent on simplicity, full transparency and creating peace of mind increases trust and helps us form more lasting partnerships for the benefit of our clients. This is why we are proud to announce our new registered trademark:<img alt=\"\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-30-at-8.17.06-AM-2.png\" width=\"648\"/><u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/transparency-fiduciary-services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Transparency </a></u>,<u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/simplicity-wealth-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Simplicity </a></u>,<u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/fiduciary-peace-of-mind/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Peace of Mind </a></u>&reg;",

    "link": "proactive-advisors-dont-leave-owners-empty-handed",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most advisors are not transaction intermediaries (investment bankers or business brokers) nor are we transaction attorneys, but all of us have worked with owners who have turned to us with questions about (or a desire to) selling to a third party. As financial planners, investment advisors, CPAs or attorneys whose expertise is not in M&amp;A, how we answer those questions has direct bearing on how successful that type of transaction will be.</p><p> There is much we can do for both our clients and their companies to ensure a successful sale&mdash;if we undertake that work before the sale process begins. Essentially, your job is to help owners define the destination and to find the &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; (or guns!) that can lower the purchase price or kill the deal completely.  These guns (or &ldquo;deal killers&rdquo;) can lurk in the owner&rsquo;s psyche or in the company.  Let&rsquo;s look as both.</p><h3> Educating Owners</h3><p> <br/> The sale process is not a cakewalk.  It demands time and attention from owners at time when their companies are under a buyer&rsquo;s intense scrutiny.  Your first job is to help the owner articulate and set his or her goals, quantify existing resources, project net sale proceeds and address any gap between what an owner has and what an owner wants before diving into the M&amp;A market.</p><p> It also falls to you to educate owners about the likely length and twists and turns of the sale process (including due diligence), and the need to follow the lead of advisors who have dealt with buyers in the past and know how they behave. You will be involved in choosing the transaction intermediaries and can help owners determine which one best fits their personalities and goals.</p><h3> Preparing The Company</h3><p> <br/> You, or another advisor, must make certain that the business is squeaky clean and ready for sale.  This pre-sale housecleaning includes reviewing and tidying up every document and issue that a buyer will examine. The issues that kill deals are generally issues that could have been eliminated with careful pre-sale planning. Consequently, the most cost- and time-efficient way to avoid Deal Killers is to prepare both owner and company.  In future articles we will examine the most common Deal Killers and how to de-fang them during pre-sale planning, but today let&rsquo;s look only at your role in helping an owner to establish goals and understand the process in a case study I call:</p><h3> How a business can sell for $19M . . . and its owner walk away empty-handed</h3><p> <br/> James Padgett called Ace Exit Planner, Shirley Locke, as a favor to a golf buddy.  James was thrilled with the $19M offer he&rsquo;d received for his company, but was concerned by his friend&rsquo;s off-hand comment that sale proceeds aren&rsquo;t always what they seem. He brought the Letter of Intent (LOI) from the buyer to this lunch meeting and explained that he&rsquo;d personally hired an investment banker who had negotiated the sale of his business for $19 million. Clearly, James was excited: first to be exiting and second to exchange ownership in a company for millions of dollars. </p><p> &ldquo;The terms of the buyer&rsquo;s offer are attractive,&rdquo; James explained. &ldquo;The sale price is $19 million&mdash;80 percent cash and 20 percent (about $4 million) in an earn-out. The buyer didn&rsquo;t want to pay that much but that&rsquo;s a fair price for a company with an EBITDA of $3.5 million!&rdquo;</p><p> Shirley nodded and asked one question, &ldquo;Mr. Padgett, how much cash do you need to net from the sale of your business to achieve your financial goals?&rdquo; Already using Locke&rsquo;s nickname, Padgett replied, &ldquo;Shirl&rsquo; I expect about $15 million&mdash;which I&rsquo;ll get&mdash;after paying capital gains taxes of 20 percent.&rdquo;</p><p> Shirl&rsquo; picked up the buyer&rsquo;s LOI which indeed offered to purchase James C corporation for $19M: the assets, not the stock, of that corporation. Locke explained to Padgett that a purchase of assets (almost entirely in the form of good will or depreciated property) meant that James&rsquo;s corporation would first pay combined federal and state taxes of about 40 percent of the sale price (or $8 million). That tax bill would shrink the proceeds (still in the corporation) to $11 million. James would then receive $11 million (as a dividend) and pay capital gains tax of 20 percent (or about $2 million). The net proceeds to James contracted again to $9 million.</p><p> James was not pleased but still anxious to sell. &ldquo;Just a minute, James,&rdquo; continued Locke. &ldquo;I estimate that the fees you&rsquo;ll pay to your investment banker, law firm and audit firm will total about $1 million. Your company will also have to pay off its $4 million bank loan from the after-tax proceeds.&rdquo;</p><p> James did the math. Those additional deductions left him about $4 million&mdash;barely more than one year&rsquo;s worth of EBITDA.  But Shirl&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t quite finished. &ldquo;Don't forget that the 20% earn out ($3.8 million) means you&rsquo;ll receive little or no cash at closing.&rdquo;</p><p> James had written two numbers on his napkin as Locke talked:</p><p> Sale price:                   $19 million <br/> <strong>  Cash in my pocket:   $ 0 </strong></p><h3> The Ask</h3><p> <br/> How could Padgett have gone this far in the process of selling his business? After all, he had a CPA firm, a business attorney, a financial and insurance advisor, a CFO and management team. He&rsquo;d already spent tens of thousands of dollars during the sale process.</p><p> How? James had consulted not one of his advisors and not one of them one had ever thought to ask James if he was, at age 63, beginning to contemplate someday leaving his business.</p><p> The moral of this story and recommendation to the thoughtful, proactive advisors who read these articles is simple:  Ask!</p><li> Ask your owner-clients if they have given thought to someday leaving their businesses.</li><li> Ask what actions have they taken to prepare for that day.</li><li> Ask what exit path they are thinking about and what they want to do after they leave their businesses.</li><p> Questions like these lead to discussion and discovery. Had an experienced advisor asked James (and the thousands of owners like him) these questions, James would not have proceeded into a sale blindly. He would have engaged in pre-sale planning.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Consumer Alert: </strong> Unless you are a day-trader, why should you care where oil prices are today or where they will be tomorrow? Unless you are a speculator, why should you give a moment&rsquo;s notice to guessing where interest rates will be six months from now? Unless your life is wrapped up in the world of rumor, expectations and stock guessing, why pay any attention at all?</p><h3> There are two answers that seem to lead the pack of possibilities.</h3><p> <br/> One is, as Simon Sinek points out in &ldquo;Leaders Eat Last&rdquo;, we are like drug addicts looking for that dopamine rush. That fix we get from watching the cable shows with the ticker on the bottom of the screen and the talking heads on top and a veritable Rose Parade of charts and graphs. Very exciting indeed!</p><p> The other possibility is that we believe we can outsmart the market, simply by watching, reading, listening and synthesizing data.  Which doesn&rsquo;t make you a dopamine addict, but simply deluded by the media spectacle, commercials, newsletters, books and other grinders of pulp fiction.</p><p> In &ldquo;What Investors Really Want&ldquo;, Professor Meir Statman demonstrates how playing against professionals is a completely different game than hitting a tennis ball against the wall. The odds of success change dramatically. So why are you&mdash;a rank amateur&mdash;trying to compete at the US Open? Why would you even think it makes sense? It&rsquo;s like the commercial with the guy who feels smarter because of the hotel he stayed in the night before.  Thinking you know something isn&rsquo;t the same as actually knowing it.</p><p> We become blinded by our own belief that we are smarter and therefore able to make rational decisions, supported by advertising that expounds on the simplicity of investing. All you need to do is follow a green line, buy a newsletter or answer a few questions on a website. Right? Of course, it makes as much sense as skydiving without a parachute. We are using the wrong set of assumptions when gauging our decisions. We assume that markets are rational, that we know when to buy and when to sell and then will act accordingly&mdash;all of which are generally completely wrong beliefs.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s be perfectly clear: speculating on an investment is gambling. It is no different than going to Vegas, buying a lottery ticket or handicapping the trifecta at the track. It is gambling. If you have the ability to sustain the loss without impacting your financial security&mdash;more power to you, if that&rsquo;s how you define entertainment. But if the loss would negatively impact your financial security, well, how shall I put this? You are either nuts, arrogant or completely fooled by the babble.</p><h3> Does anyone really believe that the talking heads on the cable shows have any knowledge or information that makes what they say important or meaningful?</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s face it, if they had real answers, they wouldn&rsquo;t be on cable&mdash;they&rsquo;d be on a yacht in the Caribbean. Get it?</p><p> So let&rsquo;s get back to reality. Stocks go up, go down and even stay static depending on a variety of factors both micro and macro. Markets (small cap, large cap, value, growth, mid-cap, international, domestic, emerging, interest rates, commodities) all move based on cycles&mdash;political, economic, and meteorological, etc.&mdash;as they will. Interest rates will hover near zero and will rise to ridiculous highs. Companies that seem like they will last forever will disappear. Where is Remington Typewriter or F. W. Woolworth today?</p><p> It&rsquo;s time to get wise before you speculate yourself into financial oblivion. Long-term investments should not be treated with short-term strategies. Measure performance appropriately, over a long enough period of time to judge your investments against appropriate benchmarks. If you&rsquo;re invested in a blend of growth and value large cap stocks, using the S&amp;P 500 is a pretty good indicator of your success or failure. But if you judge your large cap stock portfolio against the performance in micro caps or emerging markets, you are clearly using the wrong measuring tool. That would be like trying to measure the distance from NYC to Los Angeles with a yardstick.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve been on the speculation bandwagon, maybe you&rsquo;ve had a success or two that fed your excitement (like the slots forking over $100 every now and then). But overall, your chance of long-term success using this strategy is dismally small. Instead, turn off the TV, close your browser window, discontinue the newsletters and approach your financial future with realistic mature expectations. It&rsquo;s one thing to say you have a high-risk tolerance and quite another to watch your nest egg disappear on a whim.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> How Well You THINK is critical to tackle the problems that we confront in our daily lives. </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Edward de Bono&rsquo;s Six Thinking Hat technique </strong>  will help you think better and take control of every situation in life or business. This is a practical and simple tool created for focussed thinking, better communication and greater creativity.</p><p> When you are challenged with a problem, you tend to think only through your own perspective. When a complicated situation arises in your business, tackling the challenge using your habitual way of thinking can harm the overall growth of the business. Looking at a situation from a number of different critical perspectives, will broaden thinking and help improve the decision making. When decisions are to be made in a group, the individual strategies will not tend to converge. In a collaborative thinking activity even when the objectives are crystal clear, participants tend to think in different directions. Six Thinking Hats process helps to avoid this confusion and makes everyone in the group look in the same direction.</p><p> Six Thinking Hats technique trigger your minds into action and force you to think creatively considering different viewpoints. Six colors of the hats are for six types of thinking. Each hat identifies a type of thinking. Hats are actually directions of thinking and help the group use parallel thinking by &ldquo;putting on&rdquo; and &ldquo;taking off&rdquo; a hat as required making everyone think in the same way at the same time.  This hat systems can be used for problem solving, strategic planning and running meetings. The switching between thinking styles helps broaden your mind and forces each of the participants in the group to adopt to a particular thinking style as represented by the hat. The hats and colours are explained:</p><p> <strong>  WHITE HAT: </strong> neutral and objective, concerned with facts and figures</p><p> <strong>  RED HAT: </strong> the emotional view</p><p> <strong>  BLACK HAT: </strong> careful and cautious</p><p> <strong>  YELLOW HAT: </strong> sunny and positive thoughts</p><p> <strong>  GREEN HAT: </strong> associated creativity, and new ideas</p><p> <strong>  BLUE HAT: </strong> cool, related to control and organization of thinking</p><p> At a meeting, when the 6 Thinking hats technique is used, the sessions can be started using the Blue hat. The Blue hats plays the role of a facilitator or group leader- focus on the points to be discussed and defines the problem. Looking at the problem with the White hat, the group analyze the data and examine the facts and figures . With Red hat thinking, they put forward their feelings about the problem. When they think with the Black hat, the weak points, risks and fatal flaws get highlighted . With the Yellow hat however, group provides an optimistic view to the problem. They discuss  on the benefits and value the discussion can bring about. Wearing the Green hat the group proceeds to develop creative or alternative solutions to the problem. The Blue hat can be used by the meeting facilitator to switch styles as required. This deliberate role playing with hats supports cross-pollination/ diversity of thoughts and provides a common language and direction to thinking. People start using more of their brains and focus on one thing at a time. This approach helps create, evaluate and implement actions plans and reduce confrontations making people think better.</p><p> Six Thinking Hats is an effective thinking technique which results in productive discussions with solid outcomes in less time also providing alternative and creative solutions to all problems discussed. This unique and positive approach has been adopted by business officials, professionals, educators and government leaders around the world with great success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Financial services is a people business&mdash;advisors spend years cultivating relationships, earning their clients&rsquo; trust and building their businesses. There&rsquo;s a highly human element involved and many entrepreneurs are personally intertwined with their businesses. That said, thoughtful business owners recognize that there&rsquo;s more at stake than themselves as they need to ensure that their clients and staff will be well taken care of, if and when the time comes that they can no longer serve as CEO.</p><h3> <strong>  The first step: ensuring that you&rsquo;re emotionally ready to sell </strong></h3><p> <br/> Determining your emotional readiness to share some or complete control requires some soul searching. Once that hurdle is overcome and a business owner determines that he values protection of the legacy he has built more than he values total control, the next step is to identify your objectives. What is it that you are looking to solve for and what is it that you would be willing to give up? And, can you picture what life will be like once you sign on the dotted line? Only once you&rsquo;ve answered these questions should you start searching for a buyer.</p><h3> Know Thyself</h3><p> <br/> Like a marriage, you must &ldquo;know thyself&rdquo; before starting your search for Mr. or Mrs. Right. With a touch of gray hair on his head, David &ndash; the principal of a fee-only RIA with approximately $500mm of client assets under management &ndash; had built a successful financial planning and wealth management practice, yet he faced many of the same challenges that plague independent business owners throughout the country. Though David&rsquo;s firm was profitable, the ancillary administrative burdens took him away from what he loved most: interacting with clients, nurturing relationships, prospecting for new ones, and mentoring and grooming &ldquo;the next gen&rdquo; of advisors on his staff. With a changing regulatory environment, fears about how the DOL&rsquo;s fiduciary rules might impact him, and the overall cost of doing business on the rise, David was continually getting squeezed on pricing from the outside vendors he leveraged to run his business. Like any good businessperson and financial planner, David recognized the importance of continued growth and worried that relying on organic means alone just wouldn&rsquo;t be sustainable for the long haul. For the sake of his clients and his staff, he needed to ensure that he could survive in a low-return market. And David began to envision life beyond the business, thinking about time to work on his golf game, spend time with his grandchildren and just take life at a slower pace. While he had no plans to make a quick exit, his head and his heart were in the same place.</p><p> Nevertheless, many sleepless nights followed as David thought about what it would be like to give up some control and worried about how his employees and clients might feel about being part of a larger firm. Perhaps they preferred the small boutique culture that David had built? While there were a multitude of doubts lingering in David&rsquo;s mind, he knew that as a small RIA, he would face greater competition over time which would in turn drive fees lower, impact his firm&rsquo;s revenue and ultimately prevent him from continued investment in his infrastructure and staff. Additionally, David surveyed the independent advisory landscape and quickly realized that by joining forces with a larger firm, he could increase his enterprise value while ensuring that both his clients and his employees would be well taken care of.</p><h3> The Dating Game</h3><p> <br/> According to financial industry experts, M&amp;A activity hit record levels in 2015, and by July of this year the number of deals completed exceeded those closed in all of 2014. That said, selling a wealth management business is no easy task. While there are no shortage of would-be buyers out there, few have the capital and expertise to get a deal done. Sellers typically begin with a long list of potential buyers, but over time see that finding the right fit is a bit of a process as there are cultural hurdles that need to be cleared. For David, chemistry and like-mindedness were key.</p><li> Did they share the same investment philosophy?</li><li> Were their client service models similar?</li><li> Would the new entity fill the gaps that existed in David&rsquo;s firm?</li><li> Did they share the same long-term strategic vision for the business? <br/>  </li><p> Enter Joel, the principal of a $1.5B fee-only firm who had already completed one successful merger, had a robust infrastructure in place with over 30 employees, and access to the capital required to get a deal done. After close to a year of dating, it became clear to all parties that each firm&rsquo;s respective cultures were compatible and they saw the world the same way when it came to managing money and client service. Joel&rsquo;s brand was highly respected and had a successful track record of organic and inorganic growth with an infrastructure capable of sustaining future growth. Additionally, Joel&rsquo;s firm offered a trust and estate planning division, expertise David&rsquo;s high net worth clients required as their financial profiles were growing more complicated. It quickly became clear to David that by aligning with Joel&rsquo;s firm, a business that was scalable and had real enterprise value, David could offload the heavy lifting of running a business and get back to what he loved most&mdash;all while increasing the enterprise value of his firm.</p><h3> The Right Ingredients</h3><p> <br/> Finding the right fit requires commitment, patience and compromise on the part of both the seller and buyer. Upon embarking on this process, David had made the decision that for him, &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo; was not a legitimate strategy. He had spent years unsuccessfully trying to grow inorganically by recruiting advisors and had even tried his hand at acquiring smaller RIA&rsquo;s in the area. The burdens of running a business took him away from his core competency of &ldquo;making rain&rdquo; so he wasn&rsquo;t adding new clients at the same rate as he had been early on, so maintaining his profit margins had become challenging. While making the decision to sell wasn&rsquo;t easy, David came to the realization that merging was less about giving up what he had built and more about becoming part of something bigger and better. And as with any M&amp;A transaction, those that ultimately come to fruition possess the key ingredients for success: An emotionally ready and reasonable seller, and a flexible and willing buyer.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  What is the optimal filing strategy for social security benefits? </strong> Well, as you may suspect, it depends on a number of factors including your and (if married) your spouse's eligible benefit amount, how long you plan to work, your savings and retirement assets, pension income (if any) as well as any available \"special\" social security filing strategies, among others. However, one of the most critical factors to consider is life expectancy.  How long you are likely to live will have a significant impact in determining your optimal filing strategy. <br/> <br/> Obviously, no one knows exactly how long anyone will live but there are a number of important factors to consider including your own health status and family history. To be clear, the risk in retirement is not that you may die young and not get all your eligible benefits. <strong>  The real risk is that you may live a long life and outlive your money. </strong> Since social security is a pension that you can't outlive, consideration should be given to maximizing this benefit in order to protect your cash flow deep into retirement. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What if you do have longevity in your family? </strong> Clearly, if your parents, grandparents and other relatives lived a long life then there's probably a good chance that you may live a long life as well. If your own health status is also good then it probably makes sense to defer the start of your SS benefits in order to maximize the value of your payment amount. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What if you don't have longevity in your family? </strong>  In that case, it may make sense to take your benefit sooner even though it will be reduced in value. However, what if your spouse has longevity in her family but your benefit amount is higher than hers? In that case, it's typically better to defer the start of your benefit in order to maximize the value of your benefit. By doing so you will maximize the survivor benefit for your spouse. <br/> <br/> <strong>  What if there is a large difference in age between spouses? </strong> Generally speaking, the longer you wait to start taking benefits the higher your payment amount will be and the more lifetime benefits you will receive. But that's not always the case when there's an age discrepancy among spouses.  For example, I had a married couple client who were both eligible for maximum social security benefits. If they both waited until age 70 to file for benefits they would both max out their payment amounts but, surprisingly, would not maximize their combined \"expected\" lifetime benefits. The reason was because the wife was 9 years younger than the husband.  It turns out that they could actually get more in lifetime benefits if he delayed to age 70 but she filed early (at age 62) for a reduced amount. That would allow her to start receiving benefits earlier (albeit a reduced amount) but for more years before she ultimately switched to a higher survivor benefit. Since every situation is different you have to run the numbers in order to determine the optimal filing strategy.</p><p> <strong>  What if you are a widow? </strong> If you qualify for widow benefits you are eligible to file as early as age 60 for a reduced survivor benefit amount and can then later switch to your own benefit, assuming it's higher, in order to maximize your lifetime benefits. Once again, examining what your likely life expectancy will be is critical when determining the optimal way to coordinate the best way to take survivor benefits and your own benefits.</p><p> <strong>  What if you are divorced and not re-married?  </strong> Under the \"new\" social security rules resulting from the recent Bipartisan Budget Act, you will only be eligible for ex-spousal benefits if you are at least age 62 by 12/31/15. If you do qualify then you must analyze the best way to coordinate taking your own benefits with your ex-spousal benefits. In some cases it's better to take ex-spousal benefits first and delay the start of your own benefits to age 70. However, you must take a deeper look at the many factors involved in this decision including your life expectancy. As a single person living on just one social security benefit, it's important to structure your payout plan to maximize lifetime benefits in conjunction with your other retirement assets. <br/> <br/> Although estimating life expectancy clearly involves making a \"best guess\" based on family history and your own health status, it is one of the most critical components in designing an optimal social security filing strategy. The next critical step is to properly integrate social security benefits with your other retirement assets in order to maximize not only your social security benefits but also your overall retirement income.</p>",

Even so, you can&rsquo;t seem to accelerate your career at the speed you&rsquo;d like. Can anyone?</p><p> If you believe you&rsquo;ve been built for greater success at a higher level but aren&rsquo;t sure why you&rsquo;re not getting a promotion, check out the usual &ldquo;upward-moving career&rdquo; killers:</p><h3> You&rsquo;re not clear on your goals</h3><p> <br/> Whether your boss or company has effectively outlined it for you, make sure you understand what success looks like. Sometimes, organizations aren&rsquo;t sure what constitutes success. Make every effort to ensure you and your boss mutually understand your performance metrics and goals.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re out of sync with your boss</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s one thing to misunderstand your goals; it&rsquo;s another to be completely out of sync with your boss. Make every effort to understand the way he or she ticks, and tailor your communication and interaction appropriately.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re doing only what&rsquo;s expected</h3><p> <br/> The last time I checked, doing what&rsquo;s expected of you makes you blend into invisibility. No one notices unless you stand out, good or bad. Go beyond the usual day-to-day responsibilities. If you can&rsquo;t figure out a way to go beyond, then produce more of what&rsquo;s expected.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re surfacing issues, not solutions</h3><p> <br/> In every job that&rsquo;s ever existed and every job that will exist for all time there will be daily problems. Some of these issues are strategic while others are mundane. When you need help resolving these issues, make an attempt to offer solutions. This will help stimulate the thinking around your office as opposed to dragging down your boss and coworkers by your poor attitude.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re not engaging</h3><p> <br/> This is a two-fer. You&rsquo;re not behaving in an engaging manner, which causes people to avoid you. You&rsquo;re not engaging in the goings-on of the company activities, extracurriculars, and so on. Either way, you&rsquo;re still invisible.</p><h3> You only focus on the small picture</h3><p> <br/> The higher-ups think beyond their roles. They think on a macro-level and are constantly reevaluating the way the pieces work together. When you&rsquo;re at the bottom of the ladder, learn how what you do fits into the other areas. Never stop until you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s responsible for moving all the chess pieces.</p><h3> You&rsquo;ve never been on a drama diet</h3><p> <br/> Drama gluttons never get anywhere in life other than tired. Let it go. Be positive.</p><p> What are your biggest career stoppers?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Placing a call to customer support just got a little nicer and a little easier. </strong> <br/> <br/> Think about the last time you called a company's customer service number. Did you feel like you connected with the rep who answered the phone? Did the approach the rep took with you fit how you talk to others? Did your personalities mesh or clash? <br/> <br/> Now, think about the next time you need to call. Does it make you cringe?  <br/> <br/> I know how painful it can be to call customer service. There's the IVR menu that requires 17 prompts to get to the rep. And then the wait time for a rep to actually take/answer your call. Then the rep asks you questions that he should already know the answers to, based on the number you called from or the information you input through the IVR. And the time it takes to understand the issue, never mind to resolve it. All the while, you hope that the rep is patient, helpful, and nice. And more. <br/> <br/> The following outlines four things that companies need to remember as they design the customer service experience.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. First impressions are so important </strong> <br/> What is the first thing that you want your customers to know, hear, see, or experience with/about your brand? I can guarantee you that it's something positive. If that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/12/first-or-last-impression-which-one-is.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first impression  </a> </u>  isn't positive, then the chance that they'll pursue a(nother) purchase or a relationship is slim to none. No. Let's just call it what it is; the chance is none. The first impression sets the tone for what lies ahead; it sets expectations. Make it a great one! <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Treat customers the way they want to be treated </strong> <br/> The Platinum Rule states: Do unto others as they would have you do unto them, not as you would have them do unto you. Contrary to the Golden Rule, which focuses on treating others the way you want to be treated, the Platinum Rule recognizes that we don't all want to be treated the same, that we want to be treated the way we want to be treated. This Rule is much more empathetic. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Personalize the experience for the customer </strong> <br/> We are all different. We all have different needs, different feelings, different thoughts, different preferences, different perceptions, etc. As such, we want and need to be treated differently. Deliver a different experience to/for different people. <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Train for skills but hire for attitude </strong> <br/> You know the drill: Hire for attitude, train the skills. Get the right people in the door - not just those folks who fit your culture or your values but also those who truly want to be there, for the right reason. Hiring people with great attitudes (nice, friendly, professional, willing to help, courteous, empathetic, etc.) will help them connect with customers much easier than those folks with a bad attitude that no one wants to be around or talk to. Hire for attitude. Happy employees are more likely to yield happy customers. <br/> <br/> These four items are important for any call center (or retail outlet, or for that matter, anywhere  frontline staff are interacting with customers) to embrace. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a tool to help your call center with a couple - if not all - of these? <br/> <br/> Well, there is. And it is cool. <br/> <br/> Mattersight developed an award-winning solution, Predictive Behavioral Routing, that automatically matches customers to like-minded reps. Using algorithms that analyze customer speech for tone, tempo, and syntax to identify the customer's personality type and behavioral preferences, Mattersight can easily and instantly route each caller to agent who has demonstrated a high level of rapport with that type. When that match is made, agents can more easily and more genuinely help customers; the whole process becomes more efficient, and without a doubt, this makes for a better experience for customers. <br/> <br/> Forrester researched - and developed a case study based on - Mattersight's predictive behavioral routing and discovered that companies that used this system experienced four benefits:</p><li> incremental revenue</li><li> reduced customer service cost and effort</li><li> improved customer satisfaction</li><li> reduced hiring costs due to a decrease in turnover <br/>  </li><p> Not only does this tool improve the customer experience, but it enhances the employee experience, as well. When reps are paired with customers they're easily able to communicate with, there's an increase in positive interactions, which translates to a greater sense of pride because they are able to perform their jobs better. <br/> <br/> It's a win-win all around. And you can see how this system can help companies deliver on the four customer experience design requirements I outlined above. <br/> <br/> The bottom line is that people buy from people; and people especially like to buy from - or interact with -  people they like and connect with.  <br/> <br/> Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless. -Mother Teresa</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What is a Citation?</h3>Citations are listings, or mentions, of your website on other web pages &ndash; they act somewhat like links for &ldquo;Local&rdquo; SEO. However, a citation may or may not actually link back to your website, and unlike a good backlink, acquiring them is typically in your control through a registration process.The more places that your business is &ldquo;cited&rdquo;, the easier it is for the Search Engines to find your business, and the more confidence they have in listing it on the search engine results pages.<h3> Rules for Citations</h3>1. Make sure that your information (Business name, address, and phone number &ndash; NAP) is listed consistently across the web.2. If possible, include your address on every web page. I&rsquo;ve found that the footer can be a good place for this.3. Use a local phone number rather than a toll free number.4. If you have offices or stores in multiple locations, try to have a separate page for each rather than listing them all on one &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo;  page.5. I don&rsquo;t usually recommend paying for citations. The only ones that I&rsquo;ve paid for, and would recommend for most local businesses, are the Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, and any authoritative, industry related associations. (i.e. Financial Planning Association for Advisors)<h3> Citation Sites to Get You Started:</h3>There are 5 primary aggregators for local search data that send information out to the U.S. search engines and other business directories: <strong> Infogroup, Neustar Localeze, Acxiom, Factual, and Foursquare.</strong> I use <u> <a href=\"https://moz.com/local/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Moz Local </a></u> (not an affiliate link) to set these citations up &ndash; it is inexpensive and easy to do.In addition, you could get started by setting up on:<li> <u>  <a href=\"https://biz.yelp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yelp  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.superpages.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Superpages  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.yellowpages.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yellow Pages  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.expressupdateusa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Express Update USA  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.merchantcircle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Merchant Circle  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insiderpages.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Insider Pages  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.manta.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Manta  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.yellowbot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   YellowBot  </a> </u></li><li> and many others . . .</li><h3> Finding More Citation Opportunities</h3>1.<strong> Search:</strong> Use industry and location based search queries to find directories or business listings that you could use for citations. Search:<li> City + Directory</li><li> City + Business Listings</li><li> Industry + Directory</li><li> Industry + Business Listings</li><li> City + Blog (for possible links)</li><li> Industry + Blog (for possible links)</li>For example, I could search Henderson + Directory, Henderson + Business Listings, or SEO + Directory.2.<strong> Look at Your Competitor&rsquo;s Citations:</strong>Your competitors, especially those that appear higher in the rankings than you, may have found other opportunities for citations. To analyze their citations, type the business name, and either the address or phone number, in quotation marks in the Google search bar. The search engine results page will probably show many listings, including some from citation type websites.3. <strong> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.whitespark.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Whitespark  </a> </u> :</strong> Local Citation Finding Tool:Whitespark (not an affiliate link) offers a web tool that will search for &ldquo;Local&rdquo; citation opportunities for your business. They offer a limited &ldquo;free&rdquo; service that is worth checking out, but if you&rsquo;re serious about finding as many citations as possible, you&rsquo;ll probably want to subscribe.",

    "content": "<p> All over the the world our organisations are experiencing profound change. The most common way to react to that is the corporate change programme.</p><p> Every year businesses will embark on a series of reports , meetings, visioning sessions , training events and communication strategies. In almost every case the goal will be the same: to make fundamental changes to how business is conducted in order to cope with a new, more challenging market environment.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/aipmm/70-26633757\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   70% of these programmes will fail  </a> </u> . And it will largely be down to your culture.</p><p> <a href=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/blog-2-001.jpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Blog 2.001\" src=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/blog-2-001.jpeg?w=639&amp;h=479\"/> </a></p><p> Generally organisations don&rsquo;t change. They don&rsquo;t like it and don&rsquo;t see why they should.</p><p> They adopt a culture &ndash; a unique blend of practices , beliefs and customs &ndash; that takes a long time to form and an age to break down.</p><p> Think how hard is to is to make a significant change to your personal life: quitting smoking , losing weight , ending a relationship. Multiply that difficulty by the number of employees you have and the hundreds and thousands of inter-relationships.</p><p> Just as your body is designed to fight a common cold, most of our cultures protect the organisational DNA from any irritant antibodies. Add something new and it&rsquo;s likely to get rejected.</p><p> The challenge then is not to embark upon another change programme , but to disrupt your culture. To deliberately set out to mutate your organisational DNA.</p><p> But this isn&rsquo;t easy and will be resisted. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.creativitypost.com/business/how_hierarchies_kill_creativity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David Burkus  </a> </u>  points out, research suggests that there is often a cognitive bias against new introductions &ndash; a &ldquo;hierarchy of no&rdquo;.</p><p> It&rsquo;s going to be difficult for any of us to abandon our organisational structures &ndash; but there are ways you can create a &ldquo;hierarchy of yes.&rdquo;</p><p> Here are four ways to begin hacking your culture and challenging the status quo:</p><p> <strong>  1 &ndash; Hack your Hierarchy </strong></p><p> <a href=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/blog-5-001.jpeg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Blog 5.001\" src=\"https://paulbromford.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/blog-5-001.jpeg?w=639&amp;h=479\"/> </a></p><p> As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/tony-hsieh-tells-how-zappos-runs-without-bosses-1445911325?utm_content=bufferc34c4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" target=\"_blank\">   Tony Hsieh has said  </a> </u>  &ndash; one of the biggest organisational barriers to change can be managers themselves. Hierarchies simply aren&rsquo;t built to accommodate change. If change is going to happen, it often has to be project managed a year in advance!</p><p> We don&rsquo;t necessarily need to go the &lsquo;No Manager&rsquo; extremes that  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zappos?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zappos  </a> </u>  are doing, but we do need a more democratic work environment. One where employees&rsquo; input is sought into areas once reserved for a select few. Social networks are wonderful opportunities to do this but, even in 2015,  <u>  are still underused </u> .</p><p> It&rsquo;s more than seeking inputs, though. If we are serious about hacking hierarchy it means employees co-creating solutions with managers, not just feeding into meetings.</p><p> <strong>  2 &ndash; Innovate from the edges </strong></p><p> One of the mistakes change programmes often make is starting with managers. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to innovate from the centre of the business. It&rsquo;s easier to start at the outer edge and work your way in towards decision makers.</p><p> At  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bromfordlab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bromford Lab  </a> </u>  we&rsquo;ve had to distinguish between wicked problems which might require widespread organisational change &ndash; and the smaller changes and innovations we can introduce from the edges of the organisation.</p><p> It&rsquo;s why  <u>  <a href=\"http://jeffdegraff.com/blog/2012/06/forget-8020-use-the-2080-rule-instead/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jeff DeGraff  </a> </u>  argues for the creation of a &ldquo;20/80 rule&rdquo; to innovation: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to change 20 percent of your organization 80 percent than it is to change 80 percent of your firm 20 percent,&rdquo; he notes. Work your innovations from the outside in.</p><p> <strong>  3 &ndash; Create an innovation dispersal system  </strong></p><p> Keeping innovation locked up into a Lab or Hub type arrangement will only get you so far. You are going to need to infect emergent leaders if you want to bring about widespread change.</p><p> Leadership development programmes are a great way to make creativity part of everyone&rsquo;s role. However they can often instill too much adherence to past organisational behaviour rather than a more disruptive future model.</p><p> As part of our own Lab work we helped formulate  <u>  &lsquo;squads&rsquo; </u>  as a way of cultivating problems and getting things to test quickly. This is also a way of seeding innovation throughout the organisation and beginning wider cultural transformation.</p><p> <strong>  4 &ndash; Make everyone a disruptor  </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PaulBromford/do-the-right-thing-not-the-rule-thing-80a0f0286f74#.282guxfzx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Philippa Jones  </a> </u>  has recently called for people to use common sense rather than policies. For  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bromford.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bromford colleagues  </a> </u>  to bin the rulebook and think on their feet. For leaders to praise those who bend rules as long as it gets the right results for customers.</p><p> The organisation of the future will be one that differentiates their customer experience from the competition. Those who rip the rulebook apart, rather than slavishly follow the herd,  will be rewarded.</p><p> Giving people permission to create new rules is the quickest way to eliminate fear , the biggest enemy of innovation</p><p> These are all big, bold ways to hack your culture &ndash; but there are lots of mini-hacks you can do that will make a huge difference. Most colleagues are annoyed with a limited number of things which breed mediocrity.</p><p> The endless emails, the one to ones and appraisals, the meetings, the reports they have to write and the reports they have to read.</p><p> Most of us have the power to change these things. The power to test ideas and run experiments on doing these differently.</p><p> Our track record of introducing incremental change programmes is abysmal. And yet we now need to rewire our organisations for disruption. For sustaining as much rapid change as possible without falling apart.</p><p> The challenge is to develop a DNA that embraces those new and foreign ideas and quickly assimilates them.</p><li> A culture where change is led by everyone &ndash; not initiated by leaders and consultants.</li><li> Where everyone is actively questioning the status quo.</li><li> A culture that constantly asks: &ldquo;How can we do this better?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What would we do if we started again?&rdquo;. <br/>  </li><p> If we all get to that, we&rsquo;ll never need change programmes again.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p>  </p><h3> Once again, conventional wisdom is wrong.  It's the belief that partnership coaching is only for partners who are in trouble. </h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s unfortunate because successful business partners who get along well benefit greatly from coaching.  Even when everything is going well, there are always areas that can be improved and successful people always want to improve. </p><p> In fact, consider the clients of well-known coaches such as Tony Robbins.  I use him as an example because everyone knows him and that his clients are high level business execs and politicos who are for the most part successful and become moreso with coaching.</p><p> As the objective observer, an experienced partnership coach sees the blindspot that often mean money is being leaked.  No one, no matter their level of success can observe their own blindspots.  A coach can suggest strategies, hold partners accountable and in general, bring clarity to areas of vagueness and disagreement.</p><p> Coaching you about your business without a doubt affects your personal life as well.  Actually, your business is a large part of your personal life.  It&rsquo;s about you, how you want to live your life and what you want out of it. It&rsquo;s about your long term vision, your values, changes you are considering, relationships beyond your partner and what&rsquo;s next for you if and when you decide to leave the business.   In the present it&rsquo;s about what is working, achieving goals or taking a second look at them for modifying,  strategizing and staying accountable.   And it's about how you balance all of the totality of elements in your life.  An expert coach will inspire valuable personal growth and development to happen.</p><p> What can a business partnership coach offer a client that a book couldn't? Most self help books sit on shelves.  They can be excellent in pointing out issues, and some of those will be right on. But unless you are self-motivated, able to be objective about yourself, your partner and your business, create the best strategy and hold yourself accountable, the books are generally not going have the impact you desire.  A good coach would be able to personalize the issues to your unique situation and inspire you to operationalize what it is that you need to do.</p><h3> It is well known that when business is up, it is wise to continue marketing.   The same principle applies to your partnership.</h3><p> <br/> Some of the things I focus on with partners who are doing well, is to identify and describe the details of what is making it work.  Once you actually look at those and define them, they become tools that you can pull out of the tool box when you need a solution.   Without this examination, you may be doing them mindlessly.  Like driving a car&hellip;do you think through all the steps you go through to have it function successfully?  Not usually, but if you did consciously pay attention then in an emergency you might make a more thoughtful decision rather than operating on automatic, which may not be the best response.</p><p> Using deep questioning and active listening, skills which I teach, often brings the comment, &ldquo;I never thought of that&rdquo;.  At that point the door to new options opens and additional possibilities not previously apparent can now be examined and considered.</p><p> A Monthly Maintenance program is usually ideal for most successful partnerships plus an Annual Tune Up at an event such as a retreat.</p><p> It&rsquo;s too bad that the stigma of coaching still exists among many business owners because they deny themselves of realizing their business potential,  financial gain, and personal growth they could enjoy if they were to avail themselves of the service.</p><p>  </p>",

    "title": "The Waterfall Effect: Why Blockchain Is Still a Decade From Mainstream",
    "link": "the-waterfall-effect-why-blockchain-is-still-a-decade-from-mainstream",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The blockchain is a foundation, not a bit of froth</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m often asked how quickly the changes I outline will take place, and my answer is between 10 and 20 years.  The building of the real-time, almost free financial network on the internet using blockchain and mobile will take about a decade at least before it becomes mainstream.  Oh, some go.  That&rsquo;s a way off.  Can we talk about something happening sooner?</p><p> That&rsquo;s an interesting reaction, as sure we could talk about how Apple Watch Payment apps aren&rsquo;t working or the big deal with Chase Pay, but c&rsquo;mon.  I&rsquo;m not talking about incremental innovations here, but fundamental ones.  The rebuilding of the whole financial markets using shared ledgers.  The inclusion of 7 billion people in the financial network through mobile.  Those are the big ticket items.  Another user of Stripe is interesting, but it&rsquo;s not the massive change we can see coming downstream.</p><p> So why is this fundamental change going to take ten years, at least?  Because that&rsquo;s how long any major change takes to become mainstream due to The Waterfall Effect.</p><p> The Waterfall Effect is exactly that: the cascade of flowing change from idea to implementation to acceptance to mainstream; and you have to remember there are many players in play here.  It starts with a new technology, such as the blockchain shared ledger protocol. </p><p> The technology then has to be built into something robust and new providers are created to innovate &ndash; Blockapps, Chain, Chainalysis, Choosecase, Circle, Coinbase, Consensys, Epihpyte, Erethreum, Eris, Ledger X, R3CEV, Ripple, Symbiont, Tradeblock and more &ndash; and to allow this technology to be adopted. </p><p> Then the large incumbent technology providers start their programs to join these new innovators and bring them into an architecture that works for their bank clients.  Some say the incumbent technology companies move too slow.  In fact, some believe that the real problem is not the banks&rsquo; legacy systems but their legacy providers, but hey, let&rsquo;s not go there.  Eventually, the providers get it, and adapt and adopt the technologies into their frameworks and architectures.</p><h3> Eventually it&rsquo;s ready for bank prime time.</h3><p> <br/> Then that&rsquo;s another story, as now the banks have to adapt and adopt the frameworks and architectures from their incumbent providers and innovative start-up partners.  That takes time, and different banks move at different speeds dependent upon the use case and ability to change.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say this has taken about six years, and that&rsquo;s how long it&rsquo;s taken to get shared ledgers from Satoshi Nakamoto&rsquo;s white paper to serious use cases being adopted by banks as proof of concept (POC).  That&rsquo;s still a way off from POC to implementation and mainstream use.  The latter is still 3-5 years away in many cases.  For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say it takes a decade to get from the white paper to mainstream incorporation.</p><p> OK, so now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere, but we&rsquo;re still not there as the corporations and consumers haven&rsquo;t been touched yet.  Often a bank can innovate and sometimes even innovate fast, but then their customers have to change too.  Corporates will adapt and adopt a technology that will reduce costs and improve straight through processing but, a bit like the banks and their incumbent technology providers, the corporates also have legacy systems and legacy providers who also have to adapt and change.</p><p> Give that another five years and then, finally, consumers can have the service. </p><h3> But do they want it? </h3><p> <br/> According to many of my bank friends, every time they update their bank apps with new features and changed interfaces, their Net Promoter Score (NPS) goes down.  This is because 80% of customers don&rsquo;t like change.  Shoot.  So the consumer takes another year or two before they switch onto the new cheaper, faster service.  And hey.  We&rsquo;ve got there.</p><p> But this waterfall effect &ndash; new technology, start-up developers, incumbent providers, main markets of usage, clients of main market users and, finally, customer of clients &ndash; means that nay major technology change takes at least a decade to maybe three decades before it gets mainstream.  After all, the mobile telephone was invented in 1973 but took almost thirty years to become mainstream.  We talk about how things are moving faster &ndash; apps go viral in seconds &ndash; but these are things that move once you&rsquo;ve changed the underlying architecture, and that&rsquo;s why ground-breaking change takes decades.  Once you&rsquo;ve made the change however, everything that sits on that underlying architecture can move at light speed. </p><p> This is why the blockchain will take another decade before it is mainstream, as it&rsquo;s changing the foundations, the rails, the roads of finance.  It&rsquo;s not just a bit of froth on the foundation, like most of the apps out there.</p>",

    "link": "financial-advisors-you-might-be-marketing-the-wrong-way-if",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Changes in marketing have evolved and grown at a fast pace making it difficult for most brands to keep up. Key trends are changing the scope of effective marketing, making the role for marketing professionals more challenging but at the same time exciting.</p><p> Marketing professionals and strategies need to continually adjust and respond to technology changes and consumer attitudes. This means you need to look beyond outdated marketing methods and usual channels by leveraging what works today.</p><p> Here are 7 key areas to review &ndash; &ldquo;You might be marketing the wrong way if&hellip;&rdquo;</p><h3> You Aren&rsquo;t Focused On Relationship Marketing</h3><p> <br/> The goal of relationship marketing is to shift your focus away from short-term client acquisition to building loyal, long-term clients that grow your firm.</p><p> The days of mass marketing have faded as personalized, data-driven marketing takes center stage. Collect and utilize data to develop your relationships and  <strong>  personalize </strong>  your communication. Relationship marketing will help your firm create strong, emotional ties to your brand that will increase lead generation and word-of-mouth referrals.</p><p> Firms that focus on meaningful client relationships and conversations create brand advocates and raise the bar for competitors contending for purposeful connections.</p><h3> You Haven&rsquo;t Differentiated Your Firm <br/>  </h3><p> A recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pershing.com/our-thinking/thought-leadership/what-do-top-advisors-say-and-what-do-investors-really-think\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pershing Study  </a> </u>  cites 60 percent of investors found it hard to distinguish among advisors because most said the same things and made the same promises.</p><p> Do the words holistic, fiduciary, expert, and exceptional client service ring a bell? Nearly every advisor has used these terms to describe themselves and their firm. These terms rarely resonate with prospective clients, but stories and experiences do.</p><p> Think less about a 30-second sales pitch and more about your story: &ldquo;Why did you become a financial advisor?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How have you helped your clients?&rdquo; Put your answers into words and craft your message.</p><p> Here is a great example from one of the advisory teams we work with:  &ldquo;People want someone that can relate to their concerns, issues, problems, and dreams. We know the pain of losing a parent and how to deal with the costs associated with caring for a loved one. We have lived those real life events and can share our experiences with you, our client.&rdquo; </p><p> This message is authentic and resonates with clients. Create multiple scenarios that reflect how you have helped clients with specific challenges.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re Not Active on Social Media</h3><p> <br/> You need to be present and active on social media. Period.</p><p> Choose one or two networks to start and stick to a consistent publishing schedule. Publishing consistently to your social channels is important for two reasons: 1) you build credibility with your online community and 2) it improves your search engine optimization which increases the probability of being found online.</p><p> One of the most common mistakes we see is the absence of using social media as a means to capture potential client information. Use social media to drive traffic to your website and offer industry reports, newsletters, or other communication that clients and prospects can download once they have provided you with their name and email address.</p><p> Once you collect this information, move prospective clients into your sales funnel and start a drip campaign.</p><h3> You Aren&rsquo;t Asking Clients for Feedback</h3><p> <br/> Make sure you understand what your clients really want from you. Client research is one of the best ways to ensure you remain educated.</p><p> Utilize simple email surveys or ask your clients: &ldquo;What are we doing that you really value?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What one thing could we do better?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What is the most important thing we have achieved in working together?&rdquo; Utilize their answers and incorporate them into your story.</p><p> Assign someone in your office or a team of people dedicated to collaborate and brainstorm on ways to implement client recommendations.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re Not Using Video</h3><p> <br/> Placing your firm&rsquo;s video marketing on the back burner could be costing you more than you think. While video marketing is nothing new, many firms have been slow to incorporate this key component into their marketing strategy.</p><p> Grabbing the attention of potential clients is more important than ever in a world where consumers do their own research online before ever contacting you. Video offers you an effective way to communicate with current and prospective clients, showcase your brand and culture, and helps stir deep inward emotions that foster relationships.</p><p> You know the saying, &ldquo;facts tell, but stories sell.&rdquo; Video is an effective medium for storytelling. Make it a goal to create short one to two minute videos for company announcements, business updates, new products, frequently asked questions, and upcoming events.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re Not Focused on In-Bound Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Most of us are familiar with old outbound marketing methods of buying ads, email lists, and sending batch and blast emails or newsletters. The time has come to shift to an in-bound approach that focuses on creating quality content that draws prospects toward your firm.</p><p> The inbound methodology spans the entire lifecycle of a prospect, from visitor to client. Inbound marketing doesn&rsquo;t just happen, you, the marketer, have to do it. Your goal is to attract consumers, convert leads, close the sale, and provide exceptional service to retain clients. How do you do it? Align published content that appeals to your target market(s) (ideal client profile), in the right place (marketing channels), and at the right time (lifecycle stage).</p><h3> You Have an Out-dated Website</h3><p> <br/> No excuses for this one! Your website is one of the first stops people make to learn more about you. Visitors to your site need to receive an immediate positive impression or they are likely to move on.</p><p> Start with your homepage and ensure it focuses on your client and not on your firm. If your homepage talks about how wonderful you are and how long you have been in business, it&rsquo;s time for a change. Your homepage should focus on the needs of your market and the solutions you provide.</p><p> Other key components you need on your website are:</p><li> <strong>  Opt-In Form: </strong>  Provide visitors with a place to start a relationship with your firm. This is vital to growing your sales pipeline. </li><li> <strong>  Contact Information: </strong> This one sounds like a given; but, I have visited many websites where it was very difficult to find out how to contact the company. Boost your site&rsquo;s credibility by making your contact information clear: phone number, physical address, and email address.</li><li> <strong>  Optimize for Mobile: </strong>  Mobile internet usage has overtaken PC usage. Younger clients are attached to their smart phones while older generations are embracing mobile devices like tablets. If your website is not optimized for mobile, you are falling behind. If you are unsure if your firm website is mobile friendly, check with your web developer or visit  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\">   Google&rsquo;s Mobile Friendly Test  </a> </u>  to see if it passes the test. <br/>  </li><p> The best way to approach marketing is to stay agile. In the past marketing plans could be developed during the last quarter of the year. Today consumer behavior, industry trends, and competitor actions change too quickly for that approach to work. An agile approach means you carry out strategies, review how your market responds, and make tweaks to your marketing style throughout the year.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When we sell in a consultative environment, listening is more important than talking. </p><h3> Small Talk &amp; Big Listening</h3><p> <br/> Small Talk is important to build trust and to develop a relationship, but Big Listening is essential to move the sale along. There are still so many sales people selling in a B2B environment who feel the need to pitch their service or product first and foremost, rather than understanding their prospect's needs. Ask yourself, if you truly understand what your prospect is looking for before you suggest a solution. Once you identify this need you will be in a better position to provide a service that fits. Meeting a need is not only important, it is essentialfor sales professionals to be viewed as consultants or advisors. It not only helps to build trust it will also elevate your reputation. And, if you&rsquo;ve followed my blogging, you know I&rsquo;m on a mission to elevate the reputation of sales and its practitioners.</p><h3> Resist Yourself</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re in SALES, so we are often trained and expected to convince and to win over people. The temptation to \"shine\" and talk is strong, because we&rsquo;re taught that knowledge is power. Having all the knowledge to present the service/product that we are offering can blind us and that's when we might overwhelm our prospects, instead of listening and finding out what they really need.</p><p> In my book  &ldquo;Dating &amp; Selling - And Why They Are So Similar&rdquo; , I write about this in Chapter 4:</p><p>             <strong>   Did you listen to your date/prospect? </strong></p><p> If your date told you that she or he doesn't like violent movies, don't suggest to watch the newest Quentin Tarantino film.</p><p> If your prospect shares with you that they have a limited budget, don't show them a solution they can't afford. Put together a presentation that lists a couple of options, including one that is within their budget range. This shows respect, but it can also open their mind. Maybe they will be able to find additional money somewhere to buy the more expensive option. It is important however that you honor what they shared with you.</p><h3> Add Value &amp; Build Trust</h3><p> <br/> In addition, many sales people are expected to be aggressive and persistent. Persistence is good and necessary, but only to the extent that we add value and use the time with the prospect to learn more about their business. It's about finding out if there can be a fit. It&rsquo;s not about being persistent just to be persistent.</p><p> In order to be of value to prospects and clients we need to listen to their needs and respect their desire to choose. Once you allow your prospect to choose, you empower them. Once they feel empowered, they will become your ambassador.</p><p> People don't buy services or products because they are \"better\". People buy when they trust the people and the organization offering that service or product. And trust is something that needs to be built.</p><p> <strong>  You </strong>  can start building that trust with all of your prospects by adding Big Listening to your first task with each prospect.</p>",

However, you always have a problem figuring out how to approach people, no matter what the situation.</p><p> Thankfully, there are skills you can hone and then use in social or business settings. They may be verbal or nonverbal, and easy to grasp or require a little practice. I want to explore the science of great conversation with you.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at how you can  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1145238&amp;b=733599&amp;m=59453&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=www%2Ecreativelive%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Fmaster%2Dyour%2Dpeople%2Dskills%2Dvanessa%2Dvan%2Dedwards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   master your people skills  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=1145238&amp;b=733599&amp;m=59453&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=www%2Ecreativelive%2Ecom%2Fcourses%2Fpower%2Dbody%2Dlanguage%2Dvanessa%2Dvan%2Dedwards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   harness the power of body language  </a> </u>  to start conversations with anyone, anywhere, anytime.</p><p> How can you make dazzling conversation with anyone you meet? There is both an art and a science to effective communication.</p><h3> 1. Be Anti-Boring</h3><p> <br/> Everyone starts off conversations the same way. They say, &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; Instead, ask someone, &ldquo;What passion projects are you working on?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What gets you up in the morning?&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Start off Strong</h3><p> <br/> Start off the conversation with a &ldquo;how&rdquo; or &ldquo;why&rdquo; question. People will give you more thoughtful answers and really think about why you&rsquo;re asking them. Say, for instance, &ldquo;How did you meet the host?&rdquo; That way you&rsquo;ll learn about the person you&rsquo;re talking to, as well as the host.</p><h3> 3. Trips and Adventures</h3><p> <br/> Ask people if they have any trips or fun adventures coming up.</p><h3> 4. Foster Excitement</h3><p> <br/> Ask people if anything exciting happened to them that day.</p><h3> 5. Stories</h3><p> <br/> Tell a story. People love funny anecdotes and it makes your conversation more personal right off the bat.</p><h3> 6. Break it Down</h3><p> <br/> Break down a question for someone. Instead of being general and saying, &ldquo;How are you doing?,&rdquo; ask, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Fall treating you so far?&rdquo; Frame it in the context of time so he or she can thoughtfully answer the question.</p><h3> 7. Be the Highlight</h3><p> <br/> Ask a person, &ldquo;Have any highlights today?&rdquo; Not only is this person going to feel good because he or she gets to talk about him or herself, but it also starts off the conversation on a positive note.</p><h3> 8. The Handshake</h3><p> <br/> Use a firm handshake when you meet someone. Don&rsquo;t do the &ldquo;death grip,&rdquo; but make sure that your firmness level communicates that you&rsquo;re confident in yourself.</p><h3> 9. The Eyes Have It</h3><p> <br/> Make eye contact with someone. Power gaze at people; this involves looking at people&rsquo;s eyes and foreheads, and not below their mouths. That&rsquo;s only for social situations.</p><h3> 10. Power Pose</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t stand slumped over. Instead, do a power pose. Stand with your feet apart and your arms loose at your sides. People are going to be attracted to you and want to talk to you because you seem confident and in control.</p><h3> 11. Like-Dar</h3><p> <br/> Ask a &ldquo;like radar&rdquo; question. This is a question that will highlight what you two have in common. For example, you might ask, &ldquo;Keeping up with [certain sport] lately?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are your favorite restaurants around here?&rdquo; These questions and things in common will foster instant connections.</p><h3> 12. Smile</h3><p> <br/> Be positive and smile. Make sure your smile extends to your eyes so that it looks authentic. People are attracted to positivity, not negativity.</p><h3> 13. Authenticity</h3><p> <br/> Be authentic in your interactions and not sarcastic. People want to start conversations with you because you&rsquo;re being real, and not facetious.</p><h3> 14. From the Heart</h3><p> <br/> When cold calling or emailing someone, give him or her authentic compliments from the heart.</p><h3> 15. What Can I Do For You?</h3><p> <br/> During a cold interaction, say specifically what you can do for a person.</p><h3> 16. Warm it Up!</h3><p> <br/> To further your cold interaction and make it warmer, include an actionable question at the end of your call or email. For example, you could say, &ldquo;Could we jump on a call to discuss your goals with time management?&rdquo;</p><h3> 17. Your Feet</h3><p> <br/> In a group conversation, point your feet towards the person you want to hone in on and talk to. It shows that you&rsquo;re in tune with what that person has to say.</p><h3> 18. The Head Tilt</h3><p> <br/> In a group conversation, tilt your head to show that you&rsquo;re listening to the person. Then, he or she will see that you&rsquo;re paying attention and be more inclined to speak to you privately.</p><h3> 19. The Face</h3><p> <br/> Watch your microexpressions in any social setting, even if you&rsquo;re not talking to anyone. For example, if your eyebrows are raised and your lips are stretched or drawn back, it shows that you&rsquo;re afraid and not calm and collected. People want to talk to you if you&rsquo;re composed and not scared.</p><h3> 20. To Fist Bump or Not to Fist Bump?</h3><p> <br/> Do not fist bump when first meeting someone. Shake his or her hand instead. This creates oxytocin and an immediate connection.</p><h3> 21. Sweaty Palms</h3><p> <br/> Make sure your hand is dry when you go to shake another person&rsquo;s hand. Nobody wants to talk to someone with a wet hand, because it shows that he or she is nervous.</p><h3> 22. Vertical</h3><p> <br/> Hold your hand out and move it up and down with the other person&rsquo;s hand. If you hold your hand over his or hers, it demonstrates that you&rsquo;re condescending. If you put your hand out palm up, and hold it below the other person&rsquo;s hand, it shows that you&rsquo;re lower than him or her. You want to be perceived as an equal instead.</p><h3> 23. By the Bar&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> At any event, situate yourself right where people are exiting the bar with their drinks. This is when they&rsquo;re settling in and ready for interactions.</p><h3> 24. &hellip; or By the Food</h3><p> <br/> Sit down where people are eating too. As soon as they put their plates down, shake their hands and start talking to them.</p><h3> 25. The Sweet Spot</h3><p> <br/> Stand or sit still when you&rsquo;re in your sweet spot at the bar exit and the tables. Nobody wants to interact with someone who is fidgeting.</p><h3> 26. Watch Your Nerves</h3><p> <br/> On that note, watch your self-soothing behaviors. Don&rsquo;t clasp your hands together, tap your foot or self groom while waiting for people to approach you.</p><h3> 27. Alpha Behavior</h3><p> <br/> To demonstrate alpha behavior in a group and attract people to you, use expressive gestures. For example, describe two ideas coming together by bringing your hands together.</p><h3> 28. The Power of the Lean</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re in a group setting and trying to focus on connecting with one person, lean in when he or she talks. It shows, &ldquo;I want to be with you and talk with you.&rdquo;</p><h3> 29. Display Confidence</h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re standing and waiting for an interaction, keep your head up and your shoulders down to communicate how confident you are.</p><h3> 30. Vocal Power</h3><p> <br/> When you first start talking to someone, use your low vocal power to keep him or her engaged.</p><h3> 31. Remember to Breathe</h3><p> <br/> Take deep breaths and don&rsquo;t go high up with your vocals. End all your questions with a period, not a question mark. You want to sound like you&rsquo;re sure of yourself.</p><h3> 32. Be Passionate</h3><p> <br/> Add excitement into your introductions. Raise your voice, for example, when talking about your company or your passions.</p><h3> 33. Growth</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re in a group and you want people to pay attention to you, use the nonverbal hand signal for growth. This involves raising your hand in an upward slope. You&rsquo;re showing people using your body language how successful you are. Of course, we&rsquo;re all attracted to successful people and want to start conversations with them.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Expecting a bonus or a raise? Read these tips before you start Googling timeshares in Cancun</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve got an annual bonus or a well-deserved raise coming, it&rsquo;s easy to think of it as &ldquo;extra money&rdquo; you can use to splurge on a trip to Mexico, a new phone, or a serious visit to the outlet stores. It&rsquo;s particularly easy if you&rsquo;ve been sticking to your budget and feel you deserve a little fun after behaving so responsibly all year!</p><p> Before you blow it all on a phone upgrade or a cruise, though, consider these smart ways to really reward yourself with the extra infusion of resources.</p><h3> 1. Upgrade Your Budget Instead of Your Phone</h3><p> <br/> Still rocking a flip phone from the 90s? If so, yes, maybe you should invest in something smarter. But for most of us, it&rsquo;s smarter to spread the extra cash across several budget items. Go ahead and add a little to your entertainment or entertaining budget, but consider allocating the rest of it to these smart</p><h3> 2. Make a Bigger Dent in your Debt</h3><p> <br/> Are you feeling the weight of college loans, a mortgage, or, even worse, high interest credit card debt? You can lighten that load by using your bonus to make a larger payment than usual. It lowers your balance so it reduces some of those high interest charges moving forward. Increasing this budget category when you get that raise can also add up to a significant reduction of interest in the long run.</p><h3> 3. Invest to Watch it Grow</h3><p> <br/> Setting aside money when you have large expenses to deal with now can be daunting. But the earlier you start investing the more time your money has to grow. If you haven&rsquo;t already, create an investment account and put that bonus money to work for you, instead of leaving it in a checking account.</p><h3> 4. Kickstart Retiring</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve kicked your tires and they need to be replaced, by all means, safety first! Use some of the rest of the money, though, to max out your company&rsquo;s 401(k) contribution limits. If you qualify for an employer match, your bonus just got bigger!</p><h3> 5. Recalibrate Your Portfolios</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re already an investor, consider adding some of those extra funds to your investment portfolios. While you&rsquo;re at it, take a look and see what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not. Your financial advisor can help you evaluate whether your allocations should be adjusted based on your risk tolerance and your long and short-term financial goals.</p><h3> 6. Start a College Savings Plan </h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s never too early to start saving for a child&rsquo;s college education. By starting early, you can get a good head start and maximize compounded interest. Your financial advisor can help you choose a plan that works with your life, you goals your timeline, and, most importantly, your bonus!</p><h3> 7. Save for a Rainy Day</h3><p> <br/> Those emergency funds may seem like low priority, until you suddenly need them. If you haven&rsquo;t already, create an account with funds for unexepected expenses like job loss, emergency repairs, medical bills for you, your family, or your pets, and even weather emergencies (remember Hurricane Sandy?) A good rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses saved up just in case.</p><p> There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with treating yourself a little. You worked hard and you deserve it! Remember though, that by keeping the splurging and celebrating to a minimum, and letting that bonus or raise work for you, chances are you&rsquo;ll have much more to celebrate when next year&rsquo;s bonus comes around!</p>",

    "content": "<p> With the Holiday Season starting, we should be taking a careful look at our budget so that we can plan our shopping for gifts and other expenses responsibly. We&rsquo;ve all heard so much about debt that it can almost be considered another four-letter word, but are there circumstances when it can make sense to carry some debt? It is possible to have &ldquo;good debt&rdquo; as well as bad.</p><p> If debt is used responsibly to help you save money on taxes and build your wealth, it can be a good thing. However, if you have a problem keeping your spending under control or you are not living within your means, then debt can be a bad thing &ndash; especially if you are being charged high rates of interest on what you owe.</p><h3> Difference between Good Debt and Bad Debt</h3><p> <br/> The way you can tell whether debt is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is easy: If the debt grows your net worth, then it&rsquo;s good debt. Bad debt does nothing to help improve your bottom line.</p><h3> &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Ways to Use Debt</h3><p> <br/> There are instances where borrowing may actually help put you in a better overall financial position, helping to generate income and to increase your net-worth. As they say, &ldquo;It takes money to make money&rdquo;.1. Real Estate</p><p> <strong>  1. Buy a Home </strong></p><p> Most of us do not have enough cash to buy a home and so borrowing helps us to purchase this asset. Your home should increase in value over time, while your mortgage should be decreasing.</p><li> Buy Rental Property</li><p> If you are interested in investing in rental property, it often makes more sense to borrow than to use your own capital, since you can write off the lending costs. If the amount collected in rent covers most of the mortgage payments, then borrowing is probably the best way to go. Your own money is then available for you to invest.</p><p> <strong>  2. Investing </strong></p><li> Create Income</li><p> If you borrow for the specific purpose of investing to create income you can write off your loan interest costs.</p><li> Invest in an RRSP</li><p> If you don&rsquo;t have the cash on hand to invest in your RRSP, borrowing is another great option. It helps to reduce your tax burden and create a possible income tax refund, which you can then use to pay down your loan or other high-interest-rate debts. It will also keep you on track to build your retirement nest egg.</p><p> <strong>  3. General Investing </strong></p><p> Borrowing at a low interest rate and investing for a potential higher rate of return is another way to build wealth. However, this strategy comes with many risks and is not recommended for the inexperienced investor.</p><p> <strong>  4. Education </strong></p><li> Pay for your education</li><p> Borrowing for your own education or to enhance your professional skills is considered good debt, as it often comes with career advancement and higher pay.</p><p> Borrowing for your kids or grandkids&rsquo; education may also be the wiser choice if it is a choice between carrying debt or touching your retirement savings. Your financial advisor or accountant should be able to help you decide which is the better financial option.</p><p> <strong>  5. Small Business </strong></p><li> Buying a Business</li><p> It may make sense to borrow (as opposed to using your own capital) to buy a business. Borrowing frees up your own personal cash flow to use for other needs and for personal investments (RRSP).</p><h3> Recommended Debt Ratios</h3><p> <br/> It is important not to take on too much debt (even if it is good debt), as good debt can still put a strain on your cash flow and hurt your overall financial health. To find out whether the amount of debt you are carrying is manageable, calculate your debt to income ratio. (Debt payments/income x 100 = debit-to-income ratio.) For example, if you have $1,500 a month in debt payments and your income is $4,500 then your debt to income ratio would be 1500/4500 x 100 = 33%.</p><p> Calculate this number twice. Do the first calculation including only bad debt payments. The second time, include all debt payments. The bad debt ratio should not be higher than 10 or 15 percent, and your overall debt ratio should be well under 40 percent.</p><p> Credit Counselling Canada says your spending should be around the following percentages of your income:</p><p> 35% &ndash; House expenses (rent or mortgage) <br/> 15% &ndash; Unsecured lending <br/> 15% &ndash; Utilities <br/> 10% &ndash; Savings <br/> 25% &ndash; Day-to-day living expenses</p><h3> Warning Signs Your Debt is Getting Out of Control <br/>  </h3><li> Your debt ratio is above the 40 percent mark.</li><li> You&rsquo;re having trouble making your payments.</li><li> The amount of bad debt you are carrying is increasing instead of decreasing. <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s almost impossible to live debt-free but possible to keep bad debt to a minimum. It takes sacrifices and smart money choices.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Successful businesses are built on the backs of workers who believe in what they&rsquo;re doing and trust the folks they&rsquo;re working for. That&rsquo;s because those employees are engaged. Countless  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   studies  </a> </u>  show engaged employees not only are more productive, but they&rsquo;re also less likely to switch jobs.</p><p> How much do your employees trust you? If the answer is some variation of &ldquo;probably not enough,&rdquo; consider the following nine tips to strengthen the bond:</p><h3> 1. Be transparent</h3><p> <br/> Executives and managers certainly need to keep some information under wraps &mdash; and employees get that. But your staff wants as much transparency as possible. It&rsquo;s in your interest to cue them in to what&rsquo;s going on regularly.</p><h3> 2. Embrace the Golden Rule <br/>  </h3><p> We&rsquo;ve heard it ad nauseam, but it bears repeating: Treat others as you&rsquo;d like to be treated. Let your words and actions prove your commitment to them. Support them, recognize them, and listen to their feedback. Remember, respect goes two ways.</p><h3> 3. Get to know your staff <br/>  </h3><p> You spend so much time with your staff, and they spend so much time with you. Don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re strangers. Get to know your employees on a personal level, with respect to natural boundaries. Personal connections can help improve engagement.</p><h3> 4. Work hard <br/>  </h3><p> Nobody wants the boss who leans back in their chair with their feet on their desk while everyone else toils away. Work harder than your employees, and they&rsquo;ll be more comfortable following you.</p><h3> 5. Be great at what you do <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s one thing to work hard. It&rsquo;s another thing to deliver results. Great leaders understand their strengths, and they also know their weaknesses. They wisely choose to invest a vast majority of their energies on their strongest areas, and to earn your employees&rsquo; trust, so should you.</p><h3> 6. Don&rsquo;t gossip <br/>  </h3><p> Yes, we&rsquo;re all humans, and it can be tempting to let our inner elementary school selves rear their ugly heads every now and again. Be sure the unfair negative thoughts in your head are never verbalized, written down, or expressed digitally.</p><h3> 7. Be consistent <br/>  </h3><p> Nobody wants to hear one thing one minute and another thing the next. Words have meaning. Just as you probably wouldn&rsquo;t trust a friend of yours who consistently misled you, your employees won&rsquo;t trust you if you don&rsquo;t follow through on your word. So choose your words carefully, and mean what you say.</p><h3> 8. Talk less <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s a reason you&rsquo;re the boss: you&rsquo;re smart, and you&rsquo;re great at what you do. But true intelligence stems from the knowledge that we ourselves are not the be-all and end-all. Talk less and listen more. Your staff has wonderful ideas. You can help turn them into reality.</p><h3> 9. Take responsibility for failure <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;re in charge. While instinct might tell you it&rsquo;s easy to blame a failure on a member of your team who dropped the ball, never forget you&rsquo;re running the show. Your staff will respect you when you own up to shortcomings.</p><p> In order to take your company to the next level, it&rsquo;s imperative to hold the trust of your staff. When you make a conscious effort to change your leadership qualities, your employees will grow to trust you that much more. Your business will be stronger.</p>",

    "content": "<p> After a long protracted customer service call with his mobile phone provider, one in which the offending issue was not at all resolved, a friend received a text message asking for his feedback. His response came from a place of genuine frustration, and their response &ndash; clearly automated &ndash; only served to exacerbate the situation.</p><p> <a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/blog.storyforge.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/not-really-listening-_-survey-text.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"not really listening _ survey text\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/blog.storyforge.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/not-really-listening-_-survey-text.jpg?resize=235%2C417\"/> </a></p><p> My friend turned immediately to social media where he railed against the company, and shared this screen shot, extending the negative reputational impact of this one instance of poor customer service to thousands of his followers (note: a musician&rsquo;s sphere of social media influence is not to be ignored). The company&rsquo;s intent was good (ask customer for feedback) but how it was executed doomed it to failure.</p><p> I was reminded of this moment last week as I spoke with a friend who is planning the first-ever employee opinion survey for her company. The company has been through significant change in recent years. This survey &ndash; and more importantly the process preceding and following the survey event itself &ndash; will provide a great platform for employee engagement, culture shaping and leadership development &hellip; if it is managed thoughtfully and responsibly.</p><p> There five things leaders can do to set up their employee opinion survey to create positive change &hellip; and conversely, if not done, can doom it to failure.</p><li> <strong>  Know Your Purpose. </strong> Understanding why you are administering the survey is the foundational step. If you are checking it off a list of &ldquo;HR things&rdquo; that you read in Harvard Business Review are good to do, you will likely fail. You must understand the real outcome you are hoping to create, and how these outcomes link to the larger purpose of your business and what you are trying to achieve.</li><li> <strong>  Be Prepared to Act. </strong>  If you are not willing to make changes or honestly address the results of each question, then you shouldn&rsquo;t ask. For example: you ask your employees if they have good work/life balance but know in advance that your leadership team will be unwilling to consider alternatives to your current policies. Not good. Be open and willing to change &ndash; and communicate this genuinely &ndash; to set the survey process up for success.</li><li> <strong>  Communicate Your Purpose + Plan. </strong> Before you ask employees to invest their time and share their feedback, tell them why you are asking, when they&rsquo;ll hear from you and what you&rsquo;ll do with what you learn. Be clear and ensure all leaders are consistent with their messages, including the most important: what kind of privacy employees can expect. Is it completely confidential? To avoid losing trust, be clear and stick to it.</li><li> <strong>  Share the results. </strong> As soon as possible after the event (and within the timeframe you previously committed to) share the results of the survey and how you plan to address them. Four weeks ago I took a survey from a service provider and provided some very tough feedback. I have yet to hear back, or hear how or if they will take my complaints seriously. They may be working diligently in the background to address my concerns, but as a result of their silence, my willingness to share honest feedback, and my belief in their desire to hear it, are significantly diminished.</li><li> <strong>  Commit to Action. </strong> As soon as possible, coincident with the sharing the results if possible, commit publically to actions you&rsquo;ll take a result of what you&rsquo;ve learned. This may seem daunting for an inaugural survey, but is critical to ensuring that credibility, trust and optimism are engendered as part of the process. Some actions will be easy: in one company I worked with the call center operators complained in their survey of severely uncomfortable chairs, and a relatively small investment in new ergonomic chairs both improved working conditions and significantly increasing engagement. Some solutions may not be as clearly defined, even when the problems are &hellip; in these cases, leaders should commit to investigate further, outline how that investigation will occur (by focus group, employee committee, etc.) and commit to a timeframe for reporting and action. <br/>  </li><p> Throughout the survey process remember (and remind your employees) that the survey is one event in a larger and longer process of seeking feedback and improving as a result. Be grateful for the feedback you receive, and thank your employees for their candor and participation. In the end, what will make a successful second survey will be how you manage and act on the commitments coming from your first.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Customer Service Experience</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Some of my clients have mentioned to me that social media gives customers such an upper hand. One even mentioned that he felt that his customers are holding his company hostage. These clients are concerned that if they don&rsquo;t give their customers the service or experience that they think they deserve, they will turn to Twitter, share the experience on Facebook, post a negative review on Yelp, and more. </strong></p><p> You know what I think? I think that it simply means our customers are holding the company to a higher standard.</p><p> Customer service is different than in the past. One of the biggest differences is that today our customers are smarter than ever. They know what good customer service is. They hear their friends talking about it, they see it on TV. They don&rsquo;t just compare you to the service they receive from your competitor, they compare it to the amazing experience they received at the restaurant they dined at last night, or the hotel they stayed at on vacation. They compare you to Nordstrom, Zappos, and all of the other brands that are known for customer service.</p><p> When customers don&rsquo;t get the customer service they think they deserve &ndash; the service that they know a company is capable of providing &ndash; they no longer just complain to a few friends, or simply stop doing business with you. They want to tell the world about it. And, can you blame them?</p><p> I think this is good. Hold us to a higher standard. For some of us, stepping up will feel forced. For others, it will mean simply playing the game we are best known for. The bottom line is that it will be good for business.</p><p> So, how do you keep the customer from holding you hostage to a social media blitzkrieg? To start, meet the customer&rsquo;s expectations. Do what you&rsquo;re supposed to do, and do it with a positive attitude. And if you hear the customer complain, fix it. And do it fast. Don&rsquo;t let the situation get out of hand. If the complaint is not taken care of to the customer&rsquo;s minimal satisfaction, you risk them complaining to others; which means their friends at a party, family members around the dinner table, and their connections on social media.</p><p> Now, if you can exceed your customers&rsquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hyken.com/customer-confidence/dont-just-meet-expectations-exceed-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   expectations  </a> </u> , especially in contentious or tenuous situations; you create, as business guru Ken Blanchard calls them, &ldquo;raving fans.&rdquo; They will quickly learn that they can count on you, even when there is a problem. And the best part of that is that these fans will come back; and they are likely to talk about you to those same friends, family members, and social connections.</p><p> So, are our customers really holding us hostage? Or, are we just not willing to play the game the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be played today. If you&rsquo;re not already doing so, step up and deliver the customer service experience that your customers know they deserve.</p>",

They are, however, quieter than extroverts. Introverts talk plenty when they have something important to say, but they tend to stay quiet when the topic is small talk. </p><p> &hellip;Why? </p><p> Because small talk isn&rsquo;t important to them.</p><p> Now then, let&rsquo;s say you have 2 salespeople &ndash; an extrovert and an introvert. The extrovert is likely to talk &ndash; and talk &ndash; and talk &ndash; which is exactly what you expect from a sales person. And in the midst of all this talking, the extrovert will makes sales and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.charliehutton.co.uk/get-more-customers/get-more-clients/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   get more clients  </a> </u> .</p><p> But the introvert will do something the extrovert commonly fails to do &ndash; the introvert will ask questions and LISTEN to the answers.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t mean they wait for the prospect to stop talking so they can begin extolling all the many benefits of the product. </p><p> &hellip;I mean they LISTEN. </p><p> They want to know what&rsquo;s keeping the prospect awake at night in relation to the problem the product solves. They want to know the prospect&rsquo;s fears, desires, dreams, etc. They want to know what&rsquo;s worked for the prospect, what&rsquo;s failed for the prospect, and what that prospect really, truly wants so they can help this prospect get it.</p><p> And this same sales person will continue to use questions as they present their product or service, questions that direct the prospect to the desired conclusion &ndash; that this product is what they want and need.</p><p> Everything else being equal, 9 times out of 10 the introvert salesperson will outsell the extrovert &ndash; all because they asked questions and listened closely to the answers.</p><p> Introverted entrepreneurs have the same advantage as introverted sales people. They dig to discover what it is their prospects truly want. They ask questions, be in in person, over Skype, in forums, via email, etc. And they pay close attention to the answers.</p><p> These same entrepreneurs spend time researching what successful businesses are doing. They don&rsquo;t assume they already have the answers &ndash; instead, they look to those who&rsquo;ve succeeded and they ask how it was done and how it can be duplicated.</p><p> Now mind you, extroverts can master the skills of asking questions and listening to the answers as well as any introvert, if they try. It doesn&rsquo;t come as naturally for them, but it will come with practice.</p><p> And if you look at the most successful people in the world, what you will find is they stand on the shoulders of those who came before. They asked questions, got the answers and used this knowledge to carve their place in the world.</p><p> Try it. Next time someone asks you for advice, ask them questions first. Next time someone asks about your product, ask them about their needs first. Next time someone is on a forum looking for help, ask them for more information. And then pay close attention to what they say before you make your reply.</p><p> It&rsquo;s an almost unknown fact that asking the right questions and listening to the answers can be one of the highest paying skills in the world.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Sponsored by Fidelity Investments </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An RIA serving high-net-worth investors offers an entry-level service to help nurture clients with strong wealth potential. This is a case study on the strategies Wescott utilizes for reaching out to next-gen investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the emerging affluent may not meet an advisory firm&rsquo;s investable minimum today, recent Fidelity research <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1] </a> shows that this group of investors is well positioned to attain millionaire status down the road. What steps can advisors take to begin a relationship with these potential millionaires in the making as they build their asset base? To shed light on possible strategies for efficiently and profitably serving this segment, Fidelity spoke to a number of firms that are evolving their business models. The firm highlighted in this case study is Wescott Financial Advisory Group LLC, headquartered in Philadelphia, PA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 1987, Wescott is a feeonly investment advisory and wealth management firm registered with the SEC. Wescott&rsquo;s clients are highnet- worth individuals and families, trusts, foundations, pension plans, and institutions. Clients who are individuals or families typically have a range of financial planning matters that need to be addressed, which may include tax, estate, and insurance issues. They also have investable assets that exceed the firm&rsquo;s minimum of $2 million, and they would like to have these assets professionally managed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While working with its core wealth management clients, the Wescott team found instances when these clients requested assistance for other family members who didn&rsquo;t meet the required minimum. Wanting to be accommodating, the firm would establish ad hoc accounts at a lower fee structure to help these individuals with their portfolios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, Wescott opened an office in Miami. In many cases, the team was meeting with investors who were a strategic fit for the firm given the issues they were facing but, like some family members of clients, didn&rsquo;t meet the firm&rsquo;s minimum. Grant Rawdin, CEO of Wescott, wanted to find a more formalized way to work with these investors, including a growing Latino client base. After all, when he started the firm in his twenties, many of his clients weren&rsquo;t millionaires, yet they represent some of the largest relationships for Wescott today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wescott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Entrada&rdquo; program was launched in 2011 to provide investment management and associated financial planning services to clients with $250,000 to just under $2 million in assets. Entrada is Spanish for &ldquo;entrance,&rdquo; and Wescott views this as the entr&eacute;e into working with the firm. Fidelity interviewed Rawdin to learn more about Wescott&rsquo;s approach to serving what he describes as &ldquo;younger accumulators,&rdquo; and discussed four main components of the firm&rsquo;s strategy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Identify investors who are a strategic fit</li>\r\n\t<li>Scale the product offering for smaller accounts</li>\r\n\t<li>Leverage technology to create efficiencies</li>\r\n\t<li>Align younger advisors with younger investors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Identify Investors Who </strong> <strong> Are a Strategic Fit </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;Our goal was to find a way to build relationships with investors who have the potential to become significant clients for us in the future, so we launched Entrada,&rdquo; said Rawdin. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t offering the program widely to the mass affluent segment, but to select investors we see as a strategic fit. We determine if there is a fit based on the types of services they may require. First, we assess if there will potentially be significant money to be managed at some point because they are accumulating assets, advancing in their careers, or growing a company. Then, we determine what kind of planning may be needed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Many Entrada clients are younger, but they also include people who will be retiring in five to seven years, will be having a liquidity event, and are thinking hard about how to get ready for the future,&rdquo; said Rawdin. The firm doesn&rsquo;t want to lose focus on its typical high-networth client, however, and has limited the number of Entrada clients to fifteen percent of the business. &ldquo;We felt that once we exceed fifteen percent, we are developing another core product line and need to modify our infrastructure,&rdquo; added Rawdin. &ldquo;In addition, the ratios of revenues to assets and revenues to the number of clients would drop, and margins would decline when we grow that line of business further.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;People who become Entrada clients come in through Wescott and see their portfolios within the overall offering,&rdquo; said Rawdin. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t positioned as junior clients of the firm, but clients who are accessing an investment and service model that is more appropriate for the size of their portfolio.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We now have our core wealth management clients and our Entrada clients,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Those in the wealth management segment have an average account size of $5 million. On the first $2 million, they pay an investment management fee of 1.25 percent, which then declines in increments. There is an annual minimum of $25,000, which includes financial planning. Those in the Entrada segment have an average account size of $750,000. They also pay an investment management fee of 1.25 percent on assets under $2 million, but there is no annual minimum. There is a retainer fee for any financial planning that may be needed, which varies depending on the extent of the work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Scale the Product Offering for Smaller Accounts </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;We use the same people and process for building the models for Entrada and our core wealth management clients,&rdquo; said Rawdin. &ldquo;The Entrada models are simply scaled to accommodate smaller accounts. For example, our larger clients have customized portfolios with access to a number of strategies that include separate accounts, which wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate for Entrada clients given the high minimum investment required to gain access. Entrada offers clients three models that utilize different combinations of cash, bonds, and equities: moderate, moderately conservative, and aggressive. We manage all portfolios for tax optimization, and harvest tax losses wherever possible, so Entrada clients can receive a lot of services that are generally reserved for larger accounts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We handle financial planning for Entrada clients in the same way too,&rdquo; explained Rawdin. &ldquo;We have a conversation, gather data, and do a needs assessment to help develop a plan that can help keep Entrada clients focused on their goals. It normally doesn&rsquo;t require as much in-depth work, however, as our larger clients tend to have broader and more sophisticated needs that can include extensive tax and estate planning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Leverage Technology to Help Create Efficiencies </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe initial meeting with potential Entrada clients is done in person, but the ongoing flow of information is paperless. &ldquo;We have a vault that houses all the various reports and commentary, and Entrada clients receive an email when the latest information is available,&rdquo; said Rawdin. &ldquo;Some wealth management clients use this as well, but it&rsquo;s optional for them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ongoing rebalancing is also more efficient with Entrada as it&rsquo;s less involved than it is for the wealth management clients, where a lot of things are customized,&rdquo; says Rawdin. &ldquo;We are also able to streamline investment reporting for Entrada clients. Since the asset allocation strategies are more straightforward, we have simpler reports that take less time to prepare. For example, we don&rsquo;t need to provide extensive detail about each manager being used in order to assess the dynamics of the portfolio like we do for our core wealth management clients. Financial planning tends to be less complex for Entrada clients as well. The retainer approach ensures that our fees reflect the time required to prepare the plans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Align Younger Advisors with Younger Investors </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn 2008, Wescott began a formal program to groom its next generation of staff by adding several younger team members each year. &ldquo;We bring in recent graduates and teach them how we handle business at Wescott,&rdquo; said Rawdin. &ldquo;Our original intention was to train these advisors and bring them into our wealth management accounts so they could start to build relationships. However, we found that our younger associate advisors were bonding nicely with our Entrada clients, many of whom are younger themselves. We thought this was an ideal way to start an engagement that could last for many years, so have assigned them to this segment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have quarterly meetings with our wealth management clients depending on their preferences,&rdquo; added Rawdin. &ldquo;We typically meet in person with our Entrada clients once or twice a year, again because the issues are less complicated. Of course, staff members are available for discussions between visits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Moving Forward </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&ldquo;About twenty-five percent of people in Entrada portfolios are the children of our wealth management clients&mdash; or even their parents,&rdquo; said Rawdin. &ldquo;Others we have uncovered through business development efforts to grow our core wealth management clients, or through our acquisitions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Like many advisory groups, we have engaged in acquisitions of individual advisors and firms,&rdquo; explained Rawdin. &ldquo;When they have smaller accounts, we need to discuss who is going to Entrada and who is going to the wealth management program. For the acquisitions we have completed, this has worked quite well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Considerations for Your Business </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFirms are evolving their business models in a variety of ways in response to new market opportunities. After reading about the changes this one RIA has made, you may want to think about how your firm is addressing the emerging affluent investor who may be tomorrow&rsquo;s millionaire. Consider the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The team at Wescott knew they wanted to find a way to build relationships with investors who have the potential to become significant clients in the future. Do we have a clear goal and understanding of how a strategy to target a new market segment fits into our business?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are there investors who may be a strategic fit for our business, although they don&rsquo;t currently meet our asset minimum?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is there a model that could help us serve these investors efficiently and profitably?</li>\r\n\t<li>Have we thoroughly investigated technologies that could potentially help us grow, as well as streamline and scale how we do business?</li>\r\n\t<li>Do we have a strategy for bringing on the next generation of advisors, who may be able to connect with younger investors and form long-lasting relationships?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>&raquo; <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/298686795;120432729;z\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Continue to Full Article </a> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><strong>Related Articles </strong> </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keeping It in the Family: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/298686798;120432729;c\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Four Ways to Help Build Client Relationships Across Generations </a> </strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Winning Younger Investors: <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/298686796;120432729;a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Six Ways to Help Attract Gen-X and Gen-Y Clients </a> </strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"/?p=4#_ftnref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[1] </a> The 2014 Fidelity Millionaire Outlook Study.</strong><strong> </strong><br />\r\n\t<strong>For investment professional use only.

In the 1990s, just  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ebri.org/docs/default-source/rcs/2_rcs14-fs-2-expects-final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one in 10  </a> </u>  did.In reality, though, many older Americans today are retiring before they&rsquo;d planned, resulting in lower monthly Social Security checks, slimmer 401(k) accounts, and more golden years to pay for.There&rsquo;s no shortage of research looking into what derails these plans. But, for the first time, a  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/what-causes-workers-to-retire-before-they-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new study  </a> </u>  ran a statistical horse race among the various reasons known to impact older workers&rsquo; decisions. Health issues finished first in the race, followed by layoffs, and a spouse&rsquo;s early retirement.In an ideal world, eliminating these major shocks, along with a few less prevalent shocks that were also analyzed, would reduce the share of older workers retiring earlier than planned, from 37 percent to 27 percent.  [The remaining factors that were still unaccounted for in this analysis could be anything from not liking one&rsquo;s job to financial or health events that went undetected by the survey.]The analysis was limited to workers in a nationally representative survey who were age 58 at some time between 1992 and 2012. The survey asked when they expected to retire. The researchers then followed each person for up to a decade to determine who retired, whether the retirement was early or on schedule, and what intervening life changes might have caused a change in their stated plan. The changes tracked in each person&rsquo;s health and cognitive abilities included stroke, diabetes, cancer, and difficulty dressing and reading a map.The ranking was based on two things: 1) how likely one of these unanticipated life events was to bring on an earlier-than-planned retirement, and 2) the event&rsquo;s prevalence in the population. For example, involuntary job losses frequently force premature retirements but hit a fairly small segment of the population, so they ranked behind deteriorating health, which is common among older people.Financial problems should be critical to retirement decisions. But interestingly, money issues such as an increase in wealth had very little to do with the earlier-than-planned retirements. Another financial factor &ndash; the presence of retiree health care, which eases the cost of retiring &ndash; also didn&rsquo;t influence the retirement dates.It&rsquo;s nice to think we&rsquo;re in control of when we retire. But  <u>  <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/what-causes-workers-to-retire-before-they-plan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this research  </a> </u>  shows that events get in the way of our best-laid plans.</p>",

    "content": "<p> The flu is spreading rapidly throughout the US. If you listen to the media and/or the mainstream medical community, you will believe the only thing you can do to stay well is to get a flu shot. The reality is, however, that the flu shot protects you from a very particular type of influenza virus and will not increase your immunity to anything else&mdash;including common viruses or bacteria that cause colds, sore throats, sinus infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia, for example.So what can you do to stay healthy? Let me tell you what I do. Some of what I do, if observed, may seem odd, so I am discrete when I do it.</p><li> When passing a crowd of people or entering an elevator, for instance, I will first exhale and then inhale, so that I inhale my own air, rather than the droplets that may be already sitting in the air near me</li><li> After being in a public place for a length of time, I will not only use sanitizer on my hands, but will apply it to my face (this can be drying, so I make sure I moisturize also)</li><li> I make sure that my skin is well hydrated, especially my hands, so that infections can&rsquo;t enter or rest on the dry, cracked skin</li><li> I avoid hand to mouth, eye, and nose contact especially after shaking or holding hands or touching a public object (door handle, pen, etc&hellip;)</li><li> I keep my nasal cavity moist with products as Simply Saline</li><li> Avoid picking your nose!</li>One of the most powerful ways that I find to stay well during the flu season, or recover quickly if I do contract something, is to take supplements. The supplements I take are from a company called Designs for Health and I have provided links for more information. They really do work for me and I take most of them regularly at a lower dose and if I start getting sick, I up the dose. Here is the list:<li> <u>  <a href=\"http://drcharlescoachmd.dfhealthestore.com/immunitone-plus-91.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Immunotone Plus  </a> </u> &ndash; This formula is extremely powerful yet safe enough to use in high doses for acute applications, while also being suitable for long-term use in chronic conditions. This formula contains green tea standardized to a very high level of EGCG as well as standardized Echinacea augustifolia, Andrographis paniculata, and even Goldenseal. Standardized herbs contain optimal and consistent amounts of the most active compounds.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://drcharlescoachmd.dfhealthestore.com/olive-leaf-extract-90.html?___SID=U\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Olive Leaf Extract  </a> </u> &mdash;encapsulated olive leaf- one of nature's great immune enhancing botanicals. Shown to be effective for respiratory infections.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://drcharlescoachmd.dfhealthestore.com/zinc-supreme.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Zinc  </a> </u> &mdash;Many studies have shown that the use of Zinc, either in lozenge form or in a supplement as this one, greatly reduce the duration of most colds.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://drcharlescoachmd.dfhealthestore.com/c-bio-fizz-effervescent-144g-powder.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vitamin C Bio-Fizz  </a> </u> &mdash;A great-tasting fizzy C perfect for high-dosing with 2500mg of C per teaspoon along with other supportive antioxidants. Even kids love the taste!</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://drcharlescoachmd.dfhealthestore.com/vitamin-d-synergy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vitamin D3  </a> </u> &mdash;this particular brand provides vitamin K and is an essential co-factor for many immune function</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://drcharlescoachmd.dfhealthestore.com/ginger-tussin-syrup.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ginger-Tussin Syrup  </a> </u> &mdash;super concentrated ginger extract with osha and wild cherry bark to soothe the throat and enhance mucus secretions, while calming a cough and reducing inflammation.</li>These are my &ldquo;go to&rdquo; tactics and supplements for the flu and cold season.  You can pick and choose which ones might work for you. Of course, I can&rsquo;t guarantee you will stay well or get better more quickly, but I feel my suggestions will give you more of a fighting chance.",

    "link": "8-simple-questions-to-help-you-calculate-your-goal-for-new-relationships",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A few months back, one of my coaching clients unexpectedly announced that he needed to land at least 50 new relationships over the coming 12 months to hit his goals.</p><p> This new relationship target was more than double his total for the prior 12 months. And to reach this mark, this already successful advisor figured he would have to start prospecting much more aggressively than he had in recent years.</p><p> He was considering changing the way he had been running his very successful practice.</p><p> I was surprised by this assessment; it was vastly different than anything we had previously discussed. Plus, this roughly $700,000 producer had just completed his second consecutive year with more than a 25% increase in production.</p><p> &ldquo;A man flattened by an opponent can get up again. A man flattened by conformity stays down for good.&rdquo; &ndash;Thomas Watson Jr.&rdquo;</p><p> His goal of having his fee-based business revenues overtake his commission-based revenues had become a reality. By most accounts, this advisor was poised for another terrific year if he just continued to build on his past accomplishments.</p><p> After a few minutes of discussion, I decided to walk this advisor through a simple exercise to help him come up with a more realistic target for new relationships. I didn&rsquo;t want to shortchange his production goal, but I wanted to be sure he understood the basic dynamics of growing his production &mdash; combining repeat business with new business.</p><p> <strong>  I didn&rsquo;t want him to abandon a system that was already working very well. </strong></p><p> In the end, with a just a little nudge from me, my coaching client discovered 3 key facts about his new relationship goals:</p><li> First, he decided he did NOT need to begin any new prospecting initiatives. (By the way, he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy prospecting and wasn&rsquo;t sure where he would have found the time to do it.)</li><li> Second, he needed less than half the number of new relationships he had previously forecasted &mdash; 23 NOT 50 plus.</li><li> Third, by continuing to implement an advocacy-based referral process, he should produce more than enough leads to achieve his new relationship goal. In other words, his current clients are the key to BOTH new business and repeat business. <br/>  </li><p> As you set your sights on adding new relationships to your practice, it may be helpful to walk through a similar analysis. All you&rsquo;ll need is a pencil and a piece of paper to answer 8 basic questions.</p><li> <strong>  How much business have you done over the past 12 months? </strong>   For most advisors, this is an easy question.  Don&rsquo;t worry about products or payouts; just total all of your gross commissions and fees. For example purposes, let&rsquo;s use $500,000.</li><li> <strong>  How much of this revenue is repeatable? </strong>   In other words, if you didn&rsquo;t add any new clients in the coming year, how much business would you do?  Since no one can predict the future, you&rsquo;ll have to make an educated guess based on your experience, business mix and assets under management. For newer or more commission-focused advisors this number probably ranges from 40 to 60 percent of production.  More experienced, particularly fee-based, advisors with solid asset bases might use estimates in the 70 to 110 percent range.  To continue our example, let&rsquo;s assume 90% of $500,000, or $450,000.</li><li> <strong>  What is your gross revenue goal for the coming year?  </strong> Again, keep it simple. Don&rsquo;t worry about categories or grids. How much gross production have you targeted for the coming year?  In my view, anything less than a 10 percent projected increase may mean you&rsquo;re not stretching yourself enough. So, for our example, we&rsquo;ll use 10 percent growth, or $550,000.</li><li> <strong>  How much new business do you need to generate to achieve your production goal?  </strong>  Specifically, non-repeat business, revenues from brand new clients to your practice.  Your answer is the difference between your year-ahead target and your repeat business projection.  You&rsquo;re simply subtracting your answer to question 2 from your answer to question 3.  In our example, $550,000 minus $450,000 equals $100,000.</li><li> <strong>  What is your current average revenue per relationship? </strong>   Take your answer to question 1, your trailing year gross production, and divide it by the current number of households you manage. Alternatively, if you have instituted a minimum relationships size for future clients, you could base your calculation on this requirement. For example purposes, we&rsquo;ll assume 100 existing relationships, so our answer to this question is $5,000.</li><li> <strong>  How many new relationships will you need to achieve your production targets?  </strong>  If you divide your average revenue per client (question 5) into your new, new business total (question 4), you&rsquo;ll come up with a targeted number for new relationships. Continuing the computations in our example, our target for new relationships is 20, $100,000 divided by $5,000.</li><li> <strong>  How many referrals do you need to meet your new relationship target? </strong>   My work with advisors indicates that most close in excess of 50 percent of referrals.  So, if as in our example, you need 20 new relationships, you&rsquo;ll need about 40 referrals. You can adjust your actual referral target based on your past success rate and the quality of referrals you receive.</li><li> <strong>  How many referrals do you need per client to hit your goal? </strong>   Divide your answer to question 7, referrals needed, by your total number of existing relationships. In our case, you&rsquo;d only need .4 referrals per client to generate a total of 40. To take the example a step further, if you meet with your clients 4 times per year (in-person or over the phone), that&rsquo;s 400 meetings. You&rsquo;d only need to receive a referral one out of very ten meetings, 10% of the time. <br/>  </li><p> At this point, if you&rsquo;ve been running these types of calculations for your own practice, you may be thinking this exercise is too simple.  And depending on your experience as well as the quality of your client relationships, you could be right.</p><p> But, before you move on, consider two final points:</p><li> Sometimes human nature tempts us to look for complicated solutions to simple problems. My experience tells me that this can be particularly true for successful financial advisors. If you fall into this camp,  <u>  don&rsquo;t unnecessarily complicate your business </u> .</li><li> If you don&rsquo;t have a system in place for  <u>  developing a steady stream of referrals </u>  from your clients, spread your answer to question 6 (target number of new relationships) among your other prospecting strategies. Niche marketing, networking and prospecting your connections can lead you to similar calculations. <br/>  </li><p> Prospecting is tough work, but when you realistically set a target for new relationships and work backward to your activities, you can produce better results with a lot less effort and stress.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In a previous  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/understanding-alternative-investing-through-asymmetric-payoffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post  </a> </u>  we looked at alternative investing through the prism of asymmetric payoffs. Hedge funds, a classic alternative investment vehicle, tend to have a concave payoff structure that is akin to a covered call strategy &ndash; the upside is capped while the downside is shared with the market. While the overall beta of hedge funds is low (~ 0.34), the beta value increases during significant negative markets and falls sharply during significant up markets. Similarly, hedge fund returns have a correlation of about 0.7 with the S&amp;P 500 during significant down markets, but this drops to about 0.2 when markets rise. This is important because the volatility and diversification benefits that alternative strategies like hedge funds offer come from altering the payoff structure when markets go up, as opposed to taking different risks.</p><p> We closed by asking the question: why not utilize a strategy that has convex payoffs? The simplest way to construct one of these would be to buy protective puts in a long equity strategy to protect against large down markets. The problem is that tail-risk protection strategies carry a premium cost that can severely detract from long-term returns. In this post, we will look into what these costs are.</p><p> A recent paper by Israelov and Nielsen at AQR Capital Management &lsquo;Still Not Cheap: Portfolio Protection in Calm Markets&lsquo;  ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aqr.com/library/journal-articles/still-not-cheap-portfolio-protection-in-calm-markets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   link  </a> </u> ) showed that seemingly cheap put options only give the illusion of value. The authors make an important point:</p><p> &ldquo;Buying an option is not a bet that realized volatility will increase; it is a bet that realized volatility will increase above the option&rsquo;s implied volatility. Buying an option is expected to lose money even when volatility is low and rising if the spread between realized and implied volatility is sufficiently high.&rdquo;</p><h3> Portfolio Hedging using Put Options</h3><p> <br/> We consider a strategy that is long the highly liquid  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=spy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SPY ETF  </a> </u>  (which replicates the S&amp;P 500 Index) and is also long a 5% or 10% out-of-the-money (OTM) front-month SPY put option to protect the portfolio against a large downside shock. We use SPY options since these are more liquid and typically have a lower bid-ask spread than S&amp;P 500 index options. The options data is only available from January 2005 and so the strategy is tested between the period February 2005 and September 2015.</p><p> The put options are rolled over on the last trading day of each month, and the portfolio is rebalanced at close prices. For example, at the end of December, the strategy would go long an out-of-the-money put option that expires in February. This put would be sold at the end of January while simultaneously going long a put option that expires in March. To make the returns more realistic, we buy the options at their ask price and sell at the bid. The portfolio is sized to unit leverage and the amount of put options in the portfolio hedges 95%/90% of the SPY position at the time of purchase. As an example: if the price of 1 share of SPY ETF is $198 and a 5% OTM put option on SPY costs $2, the percentage of portfolio allocated to the option is 2/(198+2) = 1%. The remaining 99% of the portfolio is assumed to be long the underlying SPY ETF.</p><p> As one would expect, a strategy that is long equity and also long an out-of-the-money put does result in an asymmetric, convex payoff. The two graphs that follow show scatter plots of monthly returns for the Long SPY + Long OTM Put (5% or 10%) strategy versus S&amp;P 500 returns.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Put1-return-profile.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SPY - Put1 return profile\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Put1-return-profile.png\"/> </a></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Put2-return-profile.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SPY - Put2 return profile\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Put2-return-profile.png\"/> </a></p><p> The best-fit curve in both cases show a convex profile with positive coefficients for the quadratic term. The goodness of fit (R-squared) term is higher than that obtained when we try a linear fit to the data. Note that the asymmetry is more pronounced when using 5% OTM puts for protection, which has a larger quadratic coefficient. The betas across the entire period for the SPY + 5% OTM Put and the SPY + 10% OTM Put strategies are 0.70 and 0.85, respectively. As you go further out-of-the-money, it costs less to protect your portfolio against a large loss and the strategy starts to look more similar to a long SPY only strategy.</p><p> The convexity of the payoff becomes more clear when looking at realized betas for the two strategies in three different market environments &ndash; when the S&amp;P 500 falls more than 1.5% in a month, rises more than 1.5% in a month and is flat (between -1.5% and 1.5% monthly return). We see in the graph below that both strategies have more exposure to the market on the upside than the downside. For the SPY + 5% OTM Put strategy the beta rises from 0.46 in down markets to 0.62 in up markets, while for the SPY + 10% OTM Put strategy the beta rises from 0.68 in down markets to 0.75 in up markets.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Puts-Realized-Betas.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SPY - Puts Realized Betas\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Puts-Realized-Betas.png\"/> </a></p><p> Interestingly, the realized beta for both strategies is highest during flat markets as opposed to the strongest up markets. This is due to the fact that a lot of the large positive months for the S&amp;P 500 occur right after the large negative months. However, that is when implied volatility is highest &ndash; essentially, the cost of protection rises sharply when the market falls and this drags down returns during some of the strongest months.</p><p> That brings us right into the question of costs. As we saw above, protecting a long equity portfolio with puts results in a seemingly attractive payoff structure. But this is obviously not free. The following graph shows the cumulative performance for both strategies between February 2005 and September 2015. The strategy that is only long SPY (buy and hold) is also included for comparison.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Puts-cumulative-returns.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SPY - Puts cumulative returns\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-Puts-cumulative-returns.png\"/> </a></p><p> The overall return for a buy and hold SPY ETF strategy is 101.5% across the entire ten and half year period. However, if you bought protection each month to insure the portfolio against losses larger than 5%, you would have barely made any money: the overall return for the SPY + 5% OTM Put strategy is only 12%. The SPY + 10% OTM Put strategy fares a little better since the these puts cost less but the overall return of 38.5% is still significantly lower than buy and hold. Also note that these returns are before you factor in the transaction costs of rolling over put options each month.</p><p> The overwhelming cost of a put protection strategy can be seen in the following table detailing summary statistics and annual returns for the three strategies.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-OTM-Puts-summary-stats.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SPY + OTM Puts - summary stats\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-OTM-Puts-summary-stats.png\"/> </a></p><p> The period we consider here has not been a stellar one for equities, with the annualized return for buying and holding the SPY ETF only 6.8%. On the other hand, the annual returns for the SPY + 5% OTM Put and SPY + 10% OTM Put strategies are much lower, 1.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Buying protective puts would have extracted significant costs from the portfolio. Also, both protection strategies do not help in reducing the maximum drawdown (monthly peak-to-trough). The SPY + 5% OTM Put strategy has a drawdown of almost 45%, which is not very different from the 51% drawdown that the buy and hold strategy experienced.</p><p> In every year but for 2008, the protection strategies had lower returns than buy and hold. The SPY + 5% OTM Put strategy under-performs by an average of 6.3% annually while the SPY + 10% OTM Put strategy under-performs by an average of almost 4%. The under-performance is notable even in 2005 and 2006, when markets were relatively calm and volatility was low. The VIX index, which is the CBOE&rsquo;s market expectation of near-term volatility as conveyed by S&amp;P 500 Index option prices, averaged less than 13% in these two years.</p><p> Since the SPY tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index closely, the VIX is essentially a measure of how &lsquo;expensive&rsquo; or &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; the SPY options we use in our protection strategies are. To understand how the two strategies perform in different regimes of volatility, we sort our strategy returns over the entire ten and half year historical period by quartiles of VIX (as of close on the rollover dates). The following graph shows the average annualized return of both strategies over buy and hold in each month.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-OTM-Puts-returns-by-VIX-quartiles.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SPY - OTM Puts returns by VIX quartiles\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPY-OTM-Puts-returns-by-VIX-quartiles.png\"/> </a></p><p> The two strategies under-perform buy and hold in all VIX quartiles. The under-performance is greatest in the highest quartile (VIX averages 32%), but this is expected since options are most likely to be over-priced when volatility is relatively high. However, the under-performance is quite significant even in the lowest quartile, when VIX averages 12%: the SPY + 5% OTM Put strategy averages a return that is lower than buy and hold by 2.5% while the SPY + 10% OTM Put strategy under-performs by an average 1.2%.</p><p> The results presented above indicate that protecting a portfolio using puts to generate a convex payoff comes at significant cost. Protective puts have been costly even under benign market environments, i.e. when volatility is relatively low, and have not been &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; in any sense. Market environments, and volatility regimes in particular, tend to persist. So while one may believe that a protective put can be bought for cheap, these puts will have to be bought several times over before it actually pays off. Even in that case, as we saw with our protection strategy returns in 2008 and overall drawdown levels, the price of protection jumps sharply when markets fall.</p><p> As  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aqr.com/library/journal-articles/still-not-cheap-portfolio-protection-in-calm-markets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Israelov and Nielsen  </a> </u>  write in their paper:</p><h3> &ldquo;Proponents of buying put options in calm environments describe an opportunity to obtain protection at reduced prices during the calm before the storm. If history is any guide, the more likely outcome is that we are in the midst of the calm before the calm.&rdquo;  </h3><p> <br/> Their study, along with ours, indicate that the historical evidence appears to favor selling over buying options, even in calm periods &ndash; this strategy does result in concave payoffs but the seller is compensated since they are taking downside market risk, an important point we discussed in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/understanding-alternative-investing-through-asymmetric-payoffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   prior post  </a> </u>  about alternative investing. As the authors argue, purchasing put options, and their associated costs, may be rationalized if you believe that black swan events (think October 1987 when the market fell 20% in a day) are under-represented in the historical data and that put options are actually less expensive that they appear. However in that case the logical conclusion would be to allocate less of the portfolio to equities and more to uncorrelated or inversely correlated assets like fixed income.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Sales questions. Ask the right ones, and you&rsquo;ll build trust, uncover opportunities and cement your relationship as a trusted advisor. Ask the wrong ones, and you&rsquo;ll become known as &ldquo;a salesperson&rdquo;. <br/>  </h3><p> Voltaire once said  &ldquo;Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.&rdquo;  Yet, it seems that most sellers do a poor job of asking great questions. We ask leading questions. Questions we already know the answers to. Qualifying questions. Rhetorical questions. Yes/no questions.</p><p> When instead, we should be asking great questions.</p><p> For decades, we&rsquo;ve all been told to &ldquo;find the pain&rdquo;. &ldquo;No pain, no sale&rdquo;. Problem is, most buyers today either don&rsquo;t have (much) pressing pain, don&rsquo;t want to be reminded of it or put off doing something about it until the very, very last minute. Plus, do you really want to go in and start by putting the finger on the sore spot of someone you just met for the first time ? Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><p> Most buyers today think in much broader terms than pain. If you focus only on pain, you&rsquo;re missing out on (at least) 50% of the opportunity you could help uncover.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkaryNiGKQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sales questions: The 3 Only Questions You&rsquo;ll Ever Need (In A First Sales Meeting).  </a> </u></p><p> If you want to uncover the full range of how you could potentially help them, these three sales questions can give you an excellent start.</p><h3> Where do you want to be/go next ?</h3><p> <br/> First, get your buyer to paint a picture of the future they seek or desire for themselves, their career/business and their family (remember, emotion trumps ratio every time). Be specific. Ask for clarification. Ask &ldquo;what would that look/feel like ?&rdquo;. Dig for details (how much ? how soon ? in what form ?).</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to spend a good chunk of time on this. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how many things they&rsquo;ll say that you can help them with.</p><h3> Where are you/things now ?</h3><p> <br/> Now (and only after you&rsquo;re fully done exploring where they want to go), ask them where they are now. Get them to paint a detailed picture of where they are now. Specifically, how it&rsquo;s different from where they want to be. What&rsquo;s not going well ? What&rsquo;s the &ldquo;thorn stuck in their toe&rdquo; ? What do they wish would be different, or they could change ?</p><p> By simply asking these two sales questions, you&rsquo;ll cover fully 100% of the opportunity that is (potentially) there. You&rsquo;ll understand not only what they want to move away from (the &ldquo;pain&rdquo;), but also what they want to move towards (the &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;).</p><p> At RAIN Group, we call this pair &ldquo;Afflications and Aspirations&rdquo;.</p><p> But, there&rsquo;s one more question you should be asking.</p><h3> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s holding you back, or stopping you right now ?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Ask this question, and you get what I like to call the &ldquo;Discovery Question Triumvirate&rdquo; (DQT &ndash; just kidding, I made that up). You&rsquo;ll know everything you need to know to get started on the path towards positioning your services and seeing if there is a fit.</p><p> For 95% of my (new) clients, if they just stick to these three sales questions, dig until they find the true answers and help their prospect see how they can help them get from A (where they are now) to B (where they want to be), the quality and results of their sales meetings increases instantly and dramatically. I personally use these questions (or variations on them) in every single first sales meeting.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve ever been in a sales meeting with me, you&rsquo;ll know that&rsquo;s true. Fact.</p><p> And here&rsquo;s the real reason I religiously follow these &ndash; and recommend all my clients do the same.</p><p> No more waste.</p><p> No more fluffing around in meetings where no one has any idea of what is being accomplished. No more &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just get to know each other a little&rdquo;. No more &ldquo;shall we see if there&rsquo;s a fit.&rdquo; And &ndash; more importantly &ndash; no more time wasted on prospects who have no need, desire or plan to buy from you. Try these three sales questions, dig and present a plausible solution. All you need to do to instantly increase the quality of your sales meetings.</p>",

    "content": "<strong> For over  <u>  20 years (see earlier blog post) </u> , Capgemini has been tracking the growth of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) across the globe with our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.worldwealthreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Wealth Report  </a> </u> . Today, we released our  <u>  <a href=\"https://worldwealthreport.com/resources/world-wealth-report-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2nd Annual U.S. Wealth Report  </a> </u>  which identifies the U.S. metro areas with the highest HNWI population and assesses the impact automated advisory services (aka robo-advisors) is having on the U.S. Wealth Management industry.  Read on for highlights of this year&rsquo;s research.  </strong><h3> There is record HNWI Wealth in the U.S. with over $1 Trillion Added in 2014</h3>As much as the buzz has been on emerging markets of China and India, Capgemini has found that the U.S. quietly saw over $1 trillion added to U.S. High Net Worth Individual (HNWIs) wealth in 2014 to reach a total of $15.2 trillion.  The 4.4 million HNWIs in the U.S. by far still represents the largest HNWI market globally, with almost 2 million more than the second largest market of Japan.  In fact, 28% of new HNWI wealth added globally since 2008 was in the U.S.To put it in perspective, the five largest HNWI metropolitan areas in the U.S. have wealth levels which would fall in the list of the top 10 countries globally, with New York only exceeded by the U.S., Japan, and Germany.  Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., and San Francisco all have HNWI populations larger than the 11th largest HNWI country, India.<h3> HNWIs&rsquo; growing digital demands are changing the game &ndash; 87% of U.S. HNWIs under age 40 already consider all or most of their wealth management relationship to be digital</h3>There is clearly a large and growing HNWI market in the U.S.  However, the industry is facing a new wave of challenges, and technology is at the heart of the change.  Wealth Management has traditionally been slow to adapt to digital times.  For many years, firms held onto the conviction that Wealth Management was a face-to-face, relationship-based business.  In most ways, that remains true today.  However, the nature of the &ldquo;relationship-based&rdquo; business is evolving with technology advancements and demographic shifts.The changing mindset is largely from an awakening of how important digital is to HNWIs, especially younger ones (but also older and the ultra-wealthy).  87% of HNWIs under 40 already consider most or all of their wealth management relationship to be digital.  But it goes beyond digital as 85% of younger HNWIs are likely to leave their current firm if their needs are not met.  In fact, younger HNWIs are five times as likely to work with more than five different wealth management firms (49%) than older HNWIs (9%).These evolving HNWI expectations and increasing digital demands put incredible pressure on wealth managers. As important as digital is to HNWIs young and old, it is not a replacement for the wealth manager.  Digital is simply a tool that wealth managers can and should be leveraging to enhance their client relationships.  However, the emergence of automated advisory services (robo-advisors) is accelerating the evolution of wealth managers need to clearly define their value proposition.<h3> Use of automated advisory services (or robo-advisors) is on the rise with U.S. HNWIs noting a willingness to invest an estimated $1.5tn by 2017</h3>There has been a lot of hype around automated advisors.  AUM from the top U.S. automated advisors increased over 250% from March 2014 through September 2015.  None-the-less, the overall size to-date is rather insignificant with the top U.S. independent firms holding only about $8bn in assets (compared to $15.2tn total U.S. HNWI wealth).It&rsquo;s not today&rsquo;s size which is most worrying, it is the potential for disruption.  34% of U.S. HNWIs would consider using automated advisors.  For HNWIs under 30, this rises to 87%.  U.S. HNWIs noted a willingness to allocate an estimated US$1.5 trillion of assets to automated advisors by 2017 (US$4.2 trillion when including mass affluent).  Of course that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are actually all going to abandon their Wealth Managers.<h3> Automated advisory services offer great potential to help WM firms to meet HNWIs&rsquo; demand</h3>While robo-advisors have made inroads, they are still early in their maturity levels offering a very limited set of services.  High client demand and growing competition from non-traditional players has many wealth management firms making it a high priority to develop their own strategies for automated advice.  Traditional firms (and new ones) have a huge opportunity to claim a sizeable share of this market, but with these opportunities also come challenges.The advance of automated advisors is inevitable.  Automated advisory services offer great potential to help firms meet HNWIs&rsquo; demand for low cost and digital services.  With vendor consolidation expected, firms must choose their path:  build/acquire capabilities or partner with existing firms.  However, they need to move quickly as providing this capability to HNWI and mass affluent clients will quickly become table stakes for firms and the real value proposition of a wealth manager will be on holistic wealth advice.You can download the full report and further investigate the findings from the U.S. Wealth Report 2015 at <u> <a href=\"https://worldwealthreport.com/resources/world-wealth-report-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.us-wealthreport.com </a></u>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> 9 out of 10 projects fail, according to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/technology-business-transformation-technology-organization-large-scale-it-projects/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BCG  </a> </u> . How are your projects going?</p><p> Last week I was fortunate to attend an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.iod.com/connecting/local-networks/wales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Institute of Directors'  </a> </u>  Business Breakfast, being hosted by  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.dottedeyes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dotted Eyes  </a> </u> . The topic was \"IT for non-IT directors\" and focussed on how to improve the effectiveness of your projects. This was achieved through the metaphor of a safari and different big beasts to beware of through the project lifecycle.</p><p> At first this felt nostalgic, reminding me of all those years I spent in IT roles (including project &amp; programme management).</p><p> But as we worked through 7 tips to improve the chances of your project being a success, I was struck by something else. Firstly, that this content was clearly being shared from personal experience. Then, that it reminded me of my experience as a Customer Insight Leader. Many of these tips applied to how to succeed in that leadership challenge.</p><p> So, my thoughts turned to blogging. Here are my recollections of those tips for IT project success &amp; what they might mean for Insight Leaders:</p><h3> Stakeholder Management <br/>  </h3><p> Identifying the key stakeholders and ensuring all parties are suitably engaged early on is the first key to project success. Similarly, insight leaders can benefit from stakeholder mapping. Human nature means sometimes people will oppose your insight plans, just because they were not consulted. Near the outset, map out who has an interest and who has influence. Focus your efforts on the most powerful &amp; interested leaders in your organisation.</p><h3> Scope <br/>  </h3><p> Many a project manager will talk darkly about \"scope creep\" . It has been the death knell of projects that ended up simply out of control. Promising the earth is no good if such a stretch means nothing is actually delivered. Under promise &amp; over deliver has always been a good business maxim. Coupled with that, it's worth insight leaders ensuring that their briefing process include a clear communication back to stakeholders of what will &amp; crucially what won't be delivered. Analysts can be creative &amp; flexible but controlling scope matters too their work too.</p><h3> Business Case <br/>  </h3><p> If I had a penny for every project that has promised to improve customer retention, I'd be a rich man by now. Accountability for delivering on cost benefit analysis forecasts is too often lacking. But as well as the world of major projects that become money pits, greater commerciality can also help prioritise insight work. There are often unknowns as insights or hypotheses are sought, nevertheless with a seemingly endless stream of possible business questions, prioritisation is needed. Simon Norie has  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/i-want-to-make-changes-but-they-demanding-a-business-case/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   shared previously  </a> </u>  how this discipline can help.</p><h3> Requirements <br/>  </h3><p> As was amusingly shared, this does not equate to  Very Important Person's Personal Opinion . It's inevitable in the political minefield of business that senior leaders will seek to impose their preferences or agendas. Skilled project managers will however help them see the bigger picture &amp; through diplomacy &amp; courage avoid the project being sidetracked. Customer Insight Leaders need this same big picture thinking &amp; tenacity. Requirements should be gleaned from all the key parties, often crucially including front-line colleagues. Writing them down can help, but visualising them or bringing them to life in 'use cases' or 'customer journeys' can be even more powerful.</p><p> Design &amp; Build stages may still follow the traditional waterfall method. These days, however, they are likely to apply one of several flavours of agile development. Whether this looks more like exploratory throw-away prototyping, iterative programming or cross-functional SWAT teams, these stages still matter. However, the 7 tips shared here compliment rather than dictate these technical stages. In the related world of Customer Insight, I've also found teams with different technical approaches  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/are-softer-skills-for-analysts-being-neglected/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   all benefit from improving other skills  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Testing <br/>  </h3><p> Projects that are running late all to often cut the time for testing. As one wise project leaders has said, in fact you always test, it just depends whether you do it before or after you 'go live'. Most companies would prefer not to expose their customers to the frustration of testing new systems, so the former is preferable. Sometimes I find this rigour is also missing in insight teams. Have you as a their leader ensure a robust process of peer review and reconciliation against known sources? Nothing erodes the credibility of an insight team faster than becoming know for unreliable numbers.</p><h3> Project Management <br/>  </h3><p> Ok, this is not a stage like the tips listed above. Rather we were reminded that projects are all about effective people management &amp; thus are art as well as science. This is so true of leading customer insight functions. As a leader you should give time to hone your own people management, influencing &amp; communication skills, just as much as you value technical knowledge. Most senior insight leaders spend most of their time helping the business use insight effectively &amp; ensuring the right people are motivated in the right roles. None of that requires coding.</p><h3> Planning <br/>  </h3><p> Lack of sufficient contingency or insufficient time given to plan or identify risks at the outset, are common causes of project failure. It is a truism that \"most projects fail at the beginning not at the end\" . The same is true of much analysis. More time is often needed planning approach, identifying a clear hypothesis &amp; designing how it can be tested. It is worth reminding ourselves and our teams that working at this is working against human nature. The Planning Fallacy has been identified by  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/behavioural-economics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Behavioural Economics  </a> </u>  and we all suffer from such an optimism bias.</p><p> Do you deliver customer insight as projects?  Do you see relevant lessons from the world of project management?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TicoonTech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rick Hyde  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ticoon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ticoon  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.ticoon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Tech  </a> </u></p><p> Technology advancements, a stricter regulatory environment and a savvier consumer are forcing financial advisors to adapt their business practices &ndash; fast.</p><p> The successful financial advisor of the future will be a whole new breed of professional &ndash; a team player that is integrally connected to their clients&rsquo; financial lives, leverages technology to work flexibly and has systems and processes in place to ensure their clients&rsquo; interests are always paramount.</p><p> While many of these trends are already emerging in the marketplace, successful advisory practices will increasingly differentiate themselves from the rest with these four strategies.</p><h3> 1. Be Less Transactional and More of a Holistic Service Provider. <br/>  </h3><p> As digital technology automates more aspects of financial transactions, the role of the advisor needs to change too. Instead of brokering transactions (making investments, purchasing insurance, etc.) between clients and financial product companies, advisors of the future will focus on leveraging their client relationships by providing a broader range of services and a richer client experience.</p><p> For younger Millennial clients, who are often less experienced investors, the advisor of the future will provide basic financial help, be responsive to questions, and offer quick and immediate attention (via online/digital communications), while providing full transparency with respect to access to information and fees. The nature of the advice will also expand &ndash; for instance, the advisor of the future might even help a client pursue a salary negotiation or an asset purchase.</p><p> For older affluent clients, the advisor of the future will deliver a higher level of personal service &ndash; even taking on the role of financial concierge. Getting to know the client&rsquo;s spouse and children, all of who will be expected to be involved in the planning process, will help the advisor of the future make the transfer of wealth to the next generation an easier, more streamlined process &ndash; and one in which they continue to play a meaningful advisory role.</p><h3> 2. Build a Professional Dream Team to Serve Clients. <br/>  </h3><p> Adopting a team approach to managing more of a client&rsquo;s financial life is becoming common practice.</p><p> Smart advisors surround themselves with multiple professionals specializing in investing, wealth management, insurance or debt management, as well as other professionals such as lawyers, accountants and business consultants, to ensure that their clients get access to the knowledge they need to manage the full spectrum of their financial and business lives.</p><p> The advisor of the future will strive to play the role of quarterback for their clients, facilitating coordination and cooperation among the various advisors that are already part of their client&rsquo;s team. </p><h3> 3. Maintain a Virtual Office so You Can Go to Your Clients. <br/>  </h3><p> Future-looking advisors will strive to free themselves of the confines of the traditional bricks and mortar office and will leverage digital technology to virtualize their workspace. They will serve their clients wherever the client prefers: at their home or office, via video conferencing, using secure online channels or even at the coffee shop.</p><p> This begins with active engagement with prospects, clients and peers through effective use of online social networks to nurture their most valuable business relationships.</p><p> But it extends to the digital systems advisors use to manage their businesses, eg., back-office transactional systems, client management and marketing systems, secure access to and storage of their clients&rsquo; data, etc. Increasingly, these systems will increasingly reside in the Internet cloud and be accessed securely by mobile apps, tablets and notebook computers, so that advisors AND clients can have access to the data they need whenever and wherever they need it.</p><p> Embracing a new generation of financial technology, the future advisor will provide clients with a single online point of access to all products and services, including full-serve and self-serve options based on the customer&rsquo;s preference.</p><h3> 4. Develop Practive Around Core Values of Regulatory Compliance and Fiduciary Advice. <br/>  </h3><p> Contrary to some popular media commentary, the growth of low-fee, automated investment services, such as robo-advisors, will actually help successful human advisors of the future to differentiate their practices by offering personalized financial life planning and support. In fact, the more direct-to-consumer offerings that become available, the greater the need and opportunity for advisors to provide value-added, customized advice to help clients define and implement their financial life plans.</p><p> These advisors of the future will adopt the use of technology systems and business processes that ensure they meet and exceed regulatory compliance requirements while demonstrably acting in the fiduciary interest of their clients.</p><p> With so much changing in how financial services are delivered to the marketplace, there&rsquo;s one thing that will remain constant: When people need help with money and key life decisions, they will always seek out someone whose knowledge and character they trust.</p><p> The financial advisor of the future will strive to be that trusted life advisor. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Face it &ndash; what most of us do for clients is  <u>  <a href=\"/category/learn/robotics-and-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   indistinguishable  </a> </u>  from what other advisors do for clients, at least from the clients&rsquo; perspective. Claiming that we provide  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/client-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   great customer service  </a> </u> , financial planning, or adherence to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://advisors4advisors.com/marketing/client-communications/article/12757-marketing-the-fiduciary-standard-will-never-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciary standard won&rsquo;t work  </a> </u> . So, how can you differentiate yourself? One effective way is to &ldquo;productize&rdquo; your offering. Document your process, define what problem it solves and for whom, and package it as a single deliverable. <br/>  </h3><p> Here are a few examples:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gersteinfisher.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RealLifeFinance  </a> </u> TM (GersteinFisher, New York, NY)</li><li> <u>  Parent Care 360 </u>  (Andrew L. Comins, CLU, ChFC, MSFS)</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/retiresmart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RetireSmart  </a> </u>  (Mass Mutual)</li><li> <u>  Divorce Survival Kit </u>  (Carol Ann Wilson, CFDS)</li><li> <u>  Rescue Your IRA </u>  (Brogan Financial, Knoxville, TN) <br/>  </li><p> To productize your offering, first decide what issues it will address. Will it be oriented to risk management, college savings, retirement planning, a major life event like the loss of a loved one or a divorce, or some aspect of investment management? Identify what you will help clients work through and what the result will be at the end of the process.</p><p> Determine the outcomes and deliverables of your service. If it involves financial planning, decide what components of the plan will be fundamental. List what kinds of analysis you will perform. Decide what you will deliver and how it will look. Will it be a plan, ongoing reports, personalized page on a website, or a report? Will this be something that is delivered once during your relationship with the client, or is it an ongoing service? If it is ongoing, how frequently will you deliver it to the client?</p><p> Give everything a consistent look. The plan you deliver, any ongoing reports the client receives, the worksheets you use during the process, and the marketing material to promote the process should be named and design so that it is clear it all belongs to a cohesive system.</p><p> Once it is complete, give it a compelling name. If it is descriptive, a list can work well (our 10 point&hellip;, Our seven step&hellip;). If you can come up with something more like a brand name, consider trademarking. Whichever way you go, the point is to offer people something brief and memorable. If you have done it effectively, you can mention the name of your service to someone who is in your target market and they will ask you to tell them more about it. People will not remember everything about the description of your process or the steps involved in it, but they may remember the name. Once they have that in their memory, it gives them something quick and interesting to mention to other people.</p>",

    "title": "10 Money Apps to Help You Conquer Your Finances in the New Year",
    "link": "10-money-apps-to-help-you-conquer-your-finances-in-the-new-year",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Keeping track of your finances is easier than ever, with your computer, smartphone, and tablet all allowing you to efficiently manage your money. Today&rsquo;s apps are even better at helping you stay on top of every aspect of money coming in and going out.</p><p> The following 10 money apps are some of my favorites, and they&rsquo;ll help you conquer your finances in 2016. Ready to get on track for a successful 2016? Start downloading these money apps today!</p><h3> 1. Mint <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most popular finance trackers out there,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mint  </a> </u>  is simple to set up and intuitive to use. Mint syncs all of your accounts to give you a comprehensive picture of how much you&rsquo;re saving and spending throughout the year. The app sends you reminders before bills are due, and offers alerts on where you can save money.</p><p> In addition to helping you keep track of your bills, loan payments, and personal savings goals, Mint also summarizes  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/know-your-net-worth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   your net worth  </a> </u>  for you. If you input everything you own, including your car, house, and student loan debt, Mint will synchronize those accounts to determine your net worth. Each month, you can watch your net worth grow as you continue to make good savings and investing decisions.</p><h3> 2. Your Bank&rsquo;s Mobile App <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you bank with one of the big companies or a local credit union, almost all banks have a mobile app to help keep you connected to your money. Some institutions&rsquo; apps are increasingly sophisticated, too, using fingerprint or eye recognition technology instead of passwords for your login.</p><p> With many banking apps, you&rsquo;re able to deposit checks, transfer money, and pay bills. If you&rsquo;re ever out and remember you needed to transfer money, you can now do it &mdash; all with the touch of a button.</p><h3> 3. Waze <br/>  </h3><p> While not technically a money app,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Waze  </a> </u>  can save you in drive time. With the price of gas, that can really be helpful! Waze serves as a GPS navigation system, but what makes it unique is the fact that it&rsquo;s a crowdsourced platform. Open the app, type in your destination, and drive with the app open to get alerts from other drivers about accidents or road closures along your route. Waze helps you to avoid those troublesome spots by giving you alternate, faster routes.</p><h3> 4. Hotel Tonight <br/>  </h3><p> Formerly a &ldquo;tonight only&rdquo; hotel deals app,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.hoteltonight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hotel Tonight  </a> </u>  now let you book rooms 7 days in advance at deeply discounted rates. Hotel Tonight is ideal for last-minute travelers and planners, those who like to show up in cities on a whim and no scheduled hotel room.</p><p> Hotel Tonight is also a terrific idea for those looking for staycations. If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to stay at a fancy hotel or resort in your city, but never thought you could afford it, check out Hotel Tonight tonight and track how low prices are for a room at the resort. You&rsquo;re likely to find the cheapest rates during the week, but you can still find lower rates for booking last minute during the weekend, too. </p><h3> 5. GoodBudget <br/>  </h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://goodbudget.com/envelope-budgeting/#.VhwDF_lVhHw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   GoodBudget  </a> </u>  is an excellent money tracking app based on the envelope budgeting method. While the envelope budgeting method is excellent for planning out your spending, it&rsquo;s not exactly practical to carry around $300 cash in an envelope.</p><p> GoodBudget takes the envelope budgeting method and brings it into the 21st century. By splitting out your estimated expenses for the month, GoodBudget keeps track of your spending and subtracts it from its electronic envelopes. This app takes an excellent money planning method and makes it mobile, which makes it easy for you to stay on top of your finances.</p><h3> 6. Gas Buddy <br/>  </h3><p> The Gas Buddy app is based off the robust  Gas Buddy website, and now it&rsquo;s even more helpful as an app on your phone! The Gas Buddy app can show you the closest, cheapest gas station to you. Gas Buddy is based on user contributions, and when you report the lowest or updated gas station prizes, you&rsquo;re entered to win $100 in free gas.</p><h3> 7. Level Money</h3><p> <br/> <u>  Level Money </u>  is a budgeting and tracking app, especially designed for those of us who prefer a visual representation of our money to straight numbers. After linking your bank accounts, Level Money shows you how much is safely spendable, tracks your expenses, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/how-to-budget-and-manage-your-finances-on-a-variable-income/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   helps you plan your monthly budget  </a> </u> .</p><p> As you spend throughout the week, your full circle chart decreases as the amount you have left to spend is decreased. This not only helps you see exactly how much you&rsquo;ve spent so far, but also how close you are to being at $0 left to spend. Level Money is an excellent money app for those who prefer a visual representation of their finances.</p><h3> 8. RetailMeNot <br/>  </h3><p> Much like their excellent site,  <u>  <a href=\"http://retailmenot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RetailMeNot.com  </a> </u> , the RetailMeNot the app is an excellent aggregation of almost all the coupons out there for your favorite stores. Unlike other coupon apps that only give you discounts on things you don&rsquo;t really want, RetailMeNot has coupons for almost all major retailers. Before you go out shopping, check out your RetailMeNot app to see if there&rsquo;s a discount for you.</p><h3> 9. DealNews <br/>  </h3><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://dealnews.com/apps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DealNews app  </a> </u>  is an incredibly comprehensive money app designed to get you the best deals on quality items. With the DealNews app, you can read reviews on hundreds of discounted items, save deals for later, and create alerts for similar deals if you&rsquo;re not ready to buy right away.</p><p> Best of all, DealNews also has an app specifically tailored to Black Friday shopping. Get all the latest updates on Black Friday deals before they happen, so you can plan accordingly for your holiday gift-giving.</p><h3> 10. Shoeboxed <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re one of those people who has receipts  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/retirement-plans-for-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   for your business  </a> </u>  or to save later for taxes,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.shoeboxed.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Shoeboxed  </a> </u>  is for you. All of us have some type of receipt clutter around the house, and instead of saving everything in a shoebox in your house, save them in this electronic shoebox!</p><p> Shoeboxed scans your receipts and keeps track of everything for you once you tag a receipt as &ldquo;business expense,&rdquo; &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; and so on. You can scan receipts and documents with your phone or at home with your scanner and, best of all, export this data to QuickBooks, Evernote, Excel, and more. Shoeboxed makes finding and storing your important documents easy.</p><p> 2016 is the year to take control of your finances &mdash; so why not let technology make it a little easier on you? By using these 10 money apps to track your budget, save on shopping and gas, and possibly indulge in a deserved (and affordable!) staycation, you&rsquo;ll conquer your finances in the new year and enjoy doing it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> It might be hard to believe now, but Argentina once ranked among the top 10 wealthiest nations in the world, following the United Kingdom, United States and Australia.</p><p> Today, however, it&rsquo;s one of the most corrupt, according to  <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Transparency International  </u>  , </a>  a group that annually measures public sector corruption around the world. In 2014, Argentina ranked 107, sandwiched between Niger and Djibouti.</p><p> That&rsquo;s largely because for more than half a century, Argentina has been led almost exclusively by the far-left Justicialist Party, based on the political thought of Juan Per&oacute;n&mdash;an admirer of Mussolini&mdash;and his wife Evita.</p><p> But this week, Argentina said &ldquo;no, gracias&rdquo; to further leftist rule when it elected conservative businessman and two-term Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri to succeed Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner as president. It was an upset victory for the people of Argentina, who have seen their once-prosperous nation deteriorate under decades of Marxist policies.</p><p> It was also a strong win for investors around the globe. Not since  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/600-million-reasons-to-keep-your-eyes-on-india/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Narendra Modi&rsquo;s election  </a> </u>  last year has a leader&rsquo;s entry on the world stage inspired such bullishness.</p><p> In the three months leading up to the November 22 election, Argentina&rsquo;s Merval Index rose 30 percent as optimistic investors anticipated a win by Macri.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-11-27/COMM-argentina-presidential-election-drove-investor-confidence-11272015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Argentina Presidential Election Drove Investor Confidence\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-11-27/COMM-argentina-presidential-election-drove-investor-confidence-11272015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Last week I was in San Francisco speaking at the Silver Summit &amp; Resource Expo, where many fund managers commented that their Argentine holdings had seen huge jumps recently. Many people I spoke with there were bullish on the country.</p><h3> Latin America Veering Right to Escape Corruption</h3><p> <br/> I join many others in expressing my belief that this change in leadership points to an ideological shift in Latin America and a rejection of the Peronism that has threatened to turn the region into an also-ran economy. I&rsquo;m confident that once Argentina demonstrates to its neighbors that market-friendly policies stir economic growth and help lead to widespread prosperity, the people of Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and others will demand similar corruption-free leadership.In Venezuela&mdash;which is slightly less corrupt than the likes of Yemen, Libya and Iraq, according to Transparency International&mdash;the people are still reeling from Hugo Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s disastrous administration. With food shortages and hunger worsening, the government implemented fingerprint scanners in grocery stores last year to limit purchases of basic goods.</p><p> This, despite Ch&aacute;vez&mdash;a leader who was supposed to be &ldquo;for the people&rdquo;&mdash;being worth an estimated $2 billion at the time of his death two years ago. It&rsquo;s believed that he stole much of his wealth from the country&rsquo;s oil industry. Today, his daughter Maria Gabriela is the wealthiest woman in Venezuela, worth double that.</p><p> In August, global intelligence company Stratfor conducted an  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/bringing-venezuelas-economic-crisis-focus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   analysis of satellite imagery  </a> </u>  taken of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela&rsquo;s main port of entry for imports, between February 2012 and June 2015. The visible reduction in food container traffic is alarming.</p><p> Meanwhile, in Peru, First Lady Nadine Heredia is being investigated for money laundering and the usurpation of public functions. When I was in country earlier this month speaking at the Mining &amp; Investment Latin America Summit, there was a lot of discussion on rule of law and corruption in Peru and surrounding South American countries. It&rsquo;s estimated that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21646272-despite-epidemic-scandal-region-making-progress-against-plague-democracy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   stolen public money in Peru  </a> </u>  adds up to about 2 percent of GDP annually.</p><p> Latin Americans are increasingly saying enough is enough.</p><p> &ldquo;What happened in Argentina was the first change in Latin America,&rdquo; said former Brazil finance minister Ma&iacute;lson da N&oacute;brega, speaking to the  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-populist-pink-tide-is-ebbing-in-south-america-argentine-vote-suggests-1448326259?alg=y\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Wall Street Journal  </u>  . </a>  &ldquo;It may be the start of a downfall in populist governments. I think the next one should be Venezuela. And I think Brazil will follow suit in 2018.&rdquo;</p><p> Brazil President Dilma Rousseff, who won reelection last year, currently has an approval rating in the single digits. As I shared with you last month, her Marxist policies have suffocated business development. The country tumbled 18 points this year in the annual  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/the-10-most-competitive-countries-in-the-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Global Competitiveness Index (GCI)  </a> </u>  and is now considered to be one of the worst in terms of burdensome government regulations and unethical business practices. The people of Brazil deserve better.</p><p> This is part of the reason why I believe active management is so important. When I travel around the world and talk to different people, I obtain and return with tacit knowledge that can&rsquo;t be found by simply reading Bloomberg.</p><h3> Macri Bucks the Trend <br/>  </h3><p> In this troubling context, Mauricio Macri is a breath of fresh air. He&rsquo;s not what most people envision when they&rsquo;re asked to describe the stereotypical South American leader. Unlike Fidel Castro, Ch&aacute;vez, Rousseff and others, Macri never served as a Marxist guerilla in his youth. There are no pictures of him posing heroically in a steaming jungle, attired in military garb like fellow Argentine Che Guevara. Macri&rsquo;s more likely to be found playing a friendly game of soccer than delivering a rousing hours-long speech from a balcony. By most accounts, he&rsquo;s contemplative and soft-spoken.</p><p> But change is precisely what Argentina needs now. For the last 12 years, former President N&eacute;stor Kirchner and, following his death, wife Cristina managed only to cripple the country&rsquo;s economy even further. The size of the state doubled in the last 10 years alone. Entire industries were nationalized, taxing and spending skyrocketed, foreign investment fled and inflation exploded at an average pace of 20 percent a year.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-11-27/COMM-20-Years-of-Wild-Inflation-Argentina-vs-the-United-States-11272015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" Argentina vs. the United States\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-11-27/COMM-20-Years-of-Wild-Inflation-Argentina-vs-the-United-States-11272015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Under these conditions, holding gold in Argentina pesos has been a good bet for investors.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-11-27/COMM-Price-of-gold-per-ounce-in-argentina-pesos-11272015-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Price of Gold Per Ounce in Argentina Pesos\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-11-27/COMM-Price-of-gold-per-ounce-in-argentina-pesos-11272015.png\"/> </a></p><p> Realistic or not, Macri has vowed to roll back many policies from previous administrations. He also plans to cultivate a warmer business climate with Brazil, Argentina&rsquo;s top trading partner, and staunch the outflow of foreign capital. Last year, $2 billion left the country, a 75 percent increase from 2013, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p><p> Which is a shame. Argentina has a huge amount of untapped potential&mdash;a highly educated population, the fastest-growing middle class in Latin America and an abundance of natural resources.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s hoping Macri&rsquo;s administration can succeed at fostering a more welcome environment for business, one that might benefit the Argentine people and global investors alike.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> As part of an arrest team in the uglier part of Oakland, my job was to cover the back door while the FBI SWAT team crashed through the front door with a bantering ram. These were the sort of criminals who did not hold day jobs&mdash;we had waited until 5:00am to make certain they had made it back home. <br/>  </h3><p> I heard, &ldquo;FBI, come out with your hands up.&rdquo; I tried to control my fear as I waited for one of the suspects to make a run for it out the back door. I was wearing a bullet-proof vest and knew that I was surrounded by highly skilled FBI snipers, but that was not enough to assuage my worry that something could go wrong.</p><p> Then a scuffle, shouts, and the back door opened. One of my colleagues stepped out and gave me the OK sign that the suspects were in custody. As I lowered my weapon, my emotions immediately calmed down&mdash;the pressure was off.</p><p> As entrepreneurs and business owners, you may have felt fear when in a tense situation; or, found yourself sabotaged by an unwelcome emotion when under pressure.</p><p> Our brains are hardwired to make us emotional creatures&mdash;first and foremost. No matter how tough and self-controlled we think we are, our first reaction will ALWAYS be emotional. We can dampen or deny our emotions, but we are kidding ourselves if we think we can actually control the way in which our brain processes emotions. </p><p> You do have total control, however, over the thoughts that follow an emotion. If you are in control, you also have a great deal of power over the way in which you react to your emotion and the situation that created it.</p><h3> What Is Mental Toughness? <br/>  </h3><p> Mental toughness is managing your emotions by controlling our subsequent thoughts and behavior in ways that will set you up for success.</p><p> The key is to be aware of your emotion. If you are not fully aware of what you are feeling, you will be clueless in how to handle it effectively. You cannot change what you will not acknowledge.</p><h3> Self Awareness Is Essential <br/>  </h3><p> Mentally tough leaders understand that self-awareness is the first step in building an unbeatable mind. Self-awareness is not some touchy-feely exercise that is meant to make you feel better about yourself. </p><p> Instead, it requires mental toughness to come to terms with the good, the bad, and the ugly about yourself. You will need a strong mind to face who you really are, without the pretense of illusion or vanity. </p><p> And it takes an equally strong mind to not let your emotions jab you in the stomach when you admit to yourself that you are not Superman or Wonder Woman. If you are not in control of your emotions, you can feel like a loser and give up. </p><h3> Self-Awareness Takes Honesty And Patience <br/>  </h3><p> Mental toughness requires us to develop our strengths, and just as importantly, manage our weaknesses. </p><p> That means identifying what triggers 1) positive and healthy emotions, and 2) negative and unproductive ones. Mentally tough leaders know what triggers both types. Whether you like it or not, only by learning and understanding what triggers unhealthy patterns of thought and behavior can you begin to notice it and control it.</p><h3> 16 Ways Mentally Tough Leaders Become Self-Aware: <br/>  </h3><li> Stop treating your emotions and feelings as either good or bad.</li><li> Admit each emotion has something to teach you, even your negative emotions.</li><li> Recognize that pretending a negative emotion doesn&rsquo;t exist doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not still there, lurking beneath the surface and ready to sabotage you when you least expect it.</li><li> Put yourself under surveillance.</li><li> Notice what event, person, or situation provokes a good emotion.</li><li> Notice what event, person, or situation provokes a negative emotion.</li><li> Keep a journal of what you&rsquo;ve noticed.</li><li> Explore why you experienced a good and positive emotion.</li><li> Explore why you experienced a negative and painful emotion. Did I mention: Keep a journal of what you&rsquo;ve noticed and explored&mdash;no matter how unpleasant the emotional experience.</li><li> Work your way through the positive and negative emotion.</li><li> Express what you are feeling in less than 3 words if it&rsquo;s a negative emotion. Be honest and stop pretending your aren&rsquo;t feeling jealous, envious, angry, etc. Do NOT engage in dialogue about these negative feelings, however, as it will only increase your anxiety.</li><li> Drill down and ask yourself Why you do the things you do.</li><li> Revisit your values.</li><li> Spot your emotional reactions in others, including movies and books.</li><li> Use stress as a time to get to know yourself better.</li><li> Ask for feedback from people you trust. One more time: are you keeping track of this? <br/>  </li><p> Facing the truth about who you can be hard&mdash;even ugly at times. But it will remain ugly only if you don&rsquo;t start doing something about the things you don&rsquo;t like about yourself. Getting in touch with emotions that produce the thoughts and behavior you don&rsquo;t like takes courage and a strong mind. </p><h3> TIPS: <br/>  </h3><li> Start on one area at a time.</li><li> Find a trustworthy mentor or coach to help you through the process.</li><li> Forget about perfection, just measure your success.</li><li> Be patient with yourself.</li><li> Keep a journal or record of what you&rsquo;ve learned about yourself. <br/>  </li><p> What strategy have you used to become more self-aware?</p> ",

    "content": "<p> This post isn&rsquo;t going to be the funnest thing you&rsquo;ve read all week or probably all year, but it covers a very important topic that should be considered sooner than later.</p><p> It&rsquo;s about preparing your business and social media accounts for the inevitable &ndash; your sickness or death. While we&rsquo;d all love to pretend that immortality beams its way through Facebook or possibly the newest facial mask at the local spa, it&rsquo;s not the way life is. And that&rsquo;s okay, life is real and the more we understand its fragility, the more we&rsquo;ll appreciate it. And plan ahead for it.</p><p> This week, my phone rang and it was my father asking me to come help him because he&rsquo;d fallen off the roof. He said he was okay, but needed my help. I had no idea what to expect as I drove over, but nothing could have prepared me for the scene when I arrived. It&rsquo;s one of those surreal moments that I won&rsquo;t ever forget. My father was severely injured, and although he was mentally in a great place, his body was not.</p><p> We spent the evening in the ER before he was rushed to another hospital a few hours away for surgery and more tests. I thank God he survived the fall, and didn&rsquo;t die or paralyze himself.</p><p> But as we were sitting in the ER, I realized that someone is going to have to run his businesses, assist with his ordering, and that he won&rsquo;t be able to stand or walk for sometime. This for a person who is extremely active and basically spends all his time driving back and forth between three businesses in three different towns in the western mountains of North Carolina.</p><p> As business owners, we spend our time building a business that makes money and runs efficiently, but rarely prepare for a sickness, an accident, or worse &ndash; death. And what about our social media accounts?</p><p> A boy I went to high school with passed away over 4 years ago, and every year on his birthday Facebook alerts me because his family still hasn&rsquo;t been able to shut down his Facebook account. How sad!</p><p> But instead of being sad or getting caught up in the emotional side of this, we need to plan ahead &ndash; we need to have a solution for our businesses and social accounts, so our family/staff aren&rsquo;t burdened and we can still generate income if it&rsquo;s necessary.</p><p> You see, my father didn&rsquo;t plan ahead, and that&rsquo;s going to place even more stress on his recovery time because there will be pressure to get back to work and be healthy enough to participate. However, he is very blessed, has a wonderful staff who will jump in, and is loved by many people around him. It could be MUCH worse.</p><p> In my business, I planned for issues, but this event made me see how important it is that we&rsquo;re purposeful in our planning ahead.</p><p> So here&rsquo;s my action steps to consider and prepare your business for the inevitable.</p><h3> 1. Make your systems accessible for others to use and find <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m a systems girl &ndash; loveeee them! But are these easily accessible to others, no. Are they easy to follow along for someone else, no.  <strong>  And that matters. </strong></p><p> When I was living in Vietnam, it became imperative for me to be able to access my business systems online. As laptop after laptop was fried by the intense electrical outlets, I knew preparation was needed. So I began loading all my documents online. And when I launched ARCH, it was simple to migrate those systems to my remote team.</p><p> Systems are necessary for EVERY business. Without systems, a business owner and its staff waste a considerable amount of time because there are processes to everything we do.</p><p> But what&rsquo;s most important, for the sake of this article topic, is that systems will allow your business to run with or without you. It may not be able to run 100% without you, but it will get you as close as close can be.</p><p> Systems give others a roadmap for what needs to be done and how, empowers those who take over by giving them the tools to be successful, and cuts back on unnecessary communication.</p><p> The last part to this is to  <strong>  make sure your systems are easily accessible to anyone else who needs them </strong> , AND that they&rsquo;re compiled clearly so anyone can follow along.</p><p> For me, it&rsquo;s a main document that resides above the rest of the files and folders with clear instructions on how to utilize the systems, and clarifies naming conventions.</p><h3> 2. Have a backup plan <br/>  </h3><p> A backup plan is one that backs up your plan or your systems.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the bag an undercover agent stashed away in the event they need to pick up and leave everything. It&rsquo;s your insurance (literally or figuratively).</p><p> Your backup plan will be a document with clear instructions on how to deal with your business and social accounts in the event something happens to you.</p><p> For me, since I have a bunch of systems in place that be taken on by someone in my agency, it&rsquo;s simply writing out a master plan on how to deal with clients, when weekly meetings are, how to pay the staff, how to send invoices, etc.</p><p> It won&rsquo;t be a quick document to compile, but it will be a HUGE relief in the event something happens, and instead of worrying about your business in the ER, you&rsquo;ll be focused on yourself.</p><h3> 3. Train one person you trust to takeover <br/>  </h3><p> With the last two points to take into consideration, they won&rsquo;t fully work without one person who can step in and take over where you left off.</p><p> That person doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be someone who works for you &ndash; for many, it might be their spouse or another family member. Regardless, figure out who that person is in your life, speak with them, make sure they agree to be that person, and then make immediate plans to go over your backup plan with them.</p><p> If this person isn&rsquo;t directly involved with your business &ndash; speak with someone who works for you (a senior associate), explain that you&rsquo;ve put a backup plan together, and that this person would be taking your place in the event something happens.</p><p> When it comes to these types of situations, communication is our best friend &ndash; that and a solid backup plan.</p><p> By setting expectations and communicating your plans beforehand, there&rsquo;s minimal to no authority issues or pushback.</p><h3> 4. Keep all online account information somewhere accessible</h3><p> <br/> These days, we create new passwords constantly, and that can complicate backup plans and processes we have in place. It&rsquo;s great for privacy, but as in the example of my friend who passed away, privacy can go overboard sometimes.</p><p> Would you want your social accounts tweeting out content or Instagram account to lay dormant in the event you passed away?</p><p> Long term management of our social and online property is one that isn&rsquo;t discussed enough these days, but needs to be taken into account when considering plans for the future.</p><p> I have all my passwords in one place, but it&rsquo;s online. I&rsquo;ve been reminding myself to write those passwords in a book and hide it somewhere accessible, so it can be found easily if necessary. Plus, I haven&rsquo;t shared passwords with my trusted person.</p><p> That needs to change immediately.</p><p> Everything that&rsquo;s online is important, and we must think ahead to ensure it&rsquo;s cared for properly.</p><h3> 5. Do a test run <br/>  </h3><p> We can plan all day and be super detailed, but who knows what&rsquo;s actually going to happen when its time.</p><p> I&rsquo;m a big fan of setting things into motion to test them out after something they&rsquo;re put together. And this can and should be extended to backup plans.</p><p> Plan a day with your team, alert the person you trust, and completely walk away &ndash; see what happens. If your business is similar to mine, it will take a few days, but if its possible see what happens.</p><p> By giving the business a test run, you&rsquo;ll be able to see where the holes in your plan are and what needs to be done to acclimate it.</p>",

    "title": "Top 5 Digital Job Trends For 2016",
    "link": "top-5-digital-job-trends-for-2016",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Amy Edwards  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amy_edwards88\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Amy @BubbleJobs  </u> </a> With Christmas now just a month away, it&rsquo;s officially that time of year again: Prediction Time!Yep, over the next few weeks, you can expect your Twitter and LinkedIn feeds to be full of top prediction posts for the next 12 months on everything from SEO and Social Media to Marketing and Analytics (and everything in between!).Now, while I can take a pretty guess at some of the subjects above; today I thought I&rsquo;d stick to the one thing I know more about than anything else &ndash; and that&rsquo;s digital jobs.My day-to-day role means I see more adverts for digital job roles than even the most unsuccessful digital jobseeker &ndash; so I&rsquo;ve used that knowledge, along with my knowledge of the digital industry, to come up with my top predictions for the digital jobs market in 2016 (you can find my predictions for 2015  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/top-5-digital-job-trends-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> ).</p><h3> 1. Increased Focus On Content/Content Marketing:</h3>Since that nasty little Penguin first shook the SEO industry in 2012, we&rsquo;ve seen a big surge in companies shunning dodgy link building tactics in favour of building quality content (meaning the phrase &ldquo;Content Is King&rdquo; is officially now one of the industry&rsquo;s most annoying phases!). As a result, over the last few years we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of the big brands starting to invest more in <u> <a href=\"/category/wow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content specialists </a></u> and over the last six months or so, we&rsquo;ve seen these companies (and everyone else!) jump on the content marketing bandwagon.Why? Because it&rsquo;s a great way to engage with potential customers, generate leads, build marketing databases and just generally build a brand. That said; with another Penguin update <u> <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/googles-next-penguin-update-should-be-within-the-next-two-months-234672\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  scheduled before the end of the year </a></u> (we&rsquo;ll believe it when we see it!) and the fact that after that, Penguin will be rolled into Google&rsquo;s monthly algorithm updates, I think 2016 is going to be the year that content marketing really takes off. With that in mind; if you&rsquo;re already a content manager and you know how to build content and market it successfully, 2016 could be the year you&rsquo;ve been waiting for!<h3> 2. More Merging Of Roles:</h3>OK, so I know I first predicted this one <u> <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk/blog/blog/top-5-digital-job-trends-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  back in 2013 </a></u>, but over the last 12 months we&rsquo;ve definitely seen a big increase in brands and agencies looking to merge two completely separate roles into one in a bid to reduce hiring costs and produce a new hybrid breed of digital candidates &ndash; and I think that trend is only set to continue.Interestingly, while we first started to see a merge in similar roles eg. Content and Social a few years ago, in the last six months or so we&rsquo;ve seen companies trying to merge roles which don&rsquo;t necessarily go quite so well together &ndash; for instance, SEO and PR. With that in mind; watch out for some random new hybrid digital roles being advertised in 2016.<h3> 3. More CRM/Retention-Related Hiring:</h3>In addition to 2015 being incredibly popular for Content roles (they came second behind <u> <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk/vacancies/13/developer/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Web Development vacancies </a></u> when we counted up all of the roles we&rsquo;ve advertised on <u> <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bubble Jobs </a></u> in 2015 so far), in the last couple of months we&rsquo;ve also seen a big surge in demand for talented <u> <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk/vacancies/13/intell-insight-analy-crm-cust-data/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CRM and Customer Retention </a></u> pros from major brands like Dixons Carphone.This increase in popularity suggests that brands are finally starting to realise that simply attracting customers and getting them through the checkout isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; in order to really provide a great service and drive customers back to their sites again and again, they need to continue to deliver tailored relevant messaging and really make the customer feel valued.With that in mind; throughout 2016 we&rsquo;ll definitely see an increase in demand for talented CRM and eCRM Managers with proven track records of delivering great ROI and customer retention.<h3> 4. More Digital Strategist Roles:</h3>Throughout 2015, we&rsquo;ve seen a big surge in demand for talented <u> <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk/vacancies/13/strat-consult/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  digital strategists </a></u> from major names, including Monitor, Barclays and British Airways, as brands have started to look at the bigger picture when it comes to their digital presence and activities. From customer engagement to data and marketing, these digital strategy roles are multi-faceted and sometimes take the format of a consultant &ndash; providing a third party perspective on the business.In 2016, I think we can expect to see these jobs grow and mature &ndash; and take on a much more important role within agencies or wider digital businesses.<h3> 5. More Content/eCommerce Hybrid Roles:</h3>Following on from my second prediction, in 2016 I think we&rsquo;ll start to see eCommerce retailers re-evaluating their websites and starting to move away from a heavy sales focus and more into editorial content. With their unique brand of editorial content and sales, <u> <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/67158-why-lush-is-the-undisputed-master-of-b-commerce/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Lush </a></u> are already leading the pack with this strategy.Just to clarify; I&rsquo;m not saying for a second that traditional <u> <a href=\"http://www.bubble-jobs.co.uk/vacancies/13/ecom/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  eCommerce roles </a></u> will disappear (they never will!) &ndash; but I am saying retailers might start to look for eCommerce Managers and Merchandisers who can not only create and run an effective eCommerce store &ndash; but can also create effective editorial content to compliment products and drive interest/sales as a result.",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There are leaders, followers, and&hellip;well people who just get in the way!  Which are you?</p><p> In business today, it takes leadership to build a business that consistently engages customers. If customers aren&rsquo;t emotionally connected to your brand, through the experiences you provide, you will be vulnerable to offers and solicitations from your competitors. Such was the case for Mercedes-Benz!</p><p> Mercedes-Benz has long delivered on the brand promise &ldquo;best or nothing&rdquo; when it came to product innovation, safety, and even marketing prowess. However, calling US dealerships&rsquo; &ldquo;best or nothing&rdquo; when it came to customer experience would have been a stretch.</p><p> For approximately 3 years I&rsquo;ve worked with Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) executives as they transformed their organization into a verifiable customer experience leader. In my book Driven to Delight: Delivering World-Class Customer Experience the Mercedes-Benz Way, I offer tools and tactics everyone can use to be customer experience leaders within and beyond their industries. Here are a 6 key takeaways:</p><li> <strong>  Good Leaders Are Good Followers </strong> &ndash; Phew, you aren&rsquo;t alone on a journey of customer experience excellence. Be a student of companies and leaders that are delivering consistently engaging experiences for their customers. MBUSA leadership studied Zappos, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, Starbucks, and others as they embarked on their transformation.</li><li> <strong>  Aim High </strong> &ndash; Your customers are having experiences with providers far outside your competitive set. Strive not to just be the &ldquo;best-in-class&rdquo; &ndash; instead strive to be the &ldquo;best-of-the-best.&rdquo; Leaders at Mercedes-Benz USA didn&rsquo;t want to be the best among automobile companies; they wanted to be the best of those perennially recognized for experience excellence.</li><li> <strong>  Success Starts with Closing Your Mouth </strong> &ndash; The world is filled with people who talk a lot. If you are someone who truly listens, you will have a distinctive business advantage. When it comes to employees and customers, disciplined listening highlights wants, needs, and desires and allows you to begin to think of innovative solutions to meet those needs. Oh, by the way, by listening I mean using all your senses to tune in to those you serve. For example, listen with your eyes. At Mercedes-Benz USA, extensive training on active listening and empathizing was offered enterprise-wide early and repetitively along their journey.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t be Caught Without Your Map </strong> &ndash; Unless you happen to enjoy wandering about aimlessly, a customer journey map is an essential tool for streamlining customer experience improvement. Journey maps, such as those developed at MBUSA, detail your business from the customer&rsquo;s perspective. They enable everyone in your organization to see your customer&rsquo;s pain points, understand high value contact points, and execute to provide customer ease.</li><li> <strong>  Feedback is Your Friend </strong> &ndash; Mercedes-Benz USA and other customer-focused businesses develop tools to effectively capture and leverage &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; customer feedback both at the operational (transactional) and the relational (emotional) level.</li><li> <strong>  Obsess and Share </strong> &ndash; Don&rsquo;t make this the &ldquo;year of the customer.&rdquo; Develop a culture that tirelessly talks about your customer &ndash; one that sustains an obsession concerning customer needs. Mercedes-Benz USA has dedicated years to a concept they refer to as being &ldquo;Driven to Delight.&rdquo; That dedication is evidenced in robust training programs as well as constant sharing of customer delight stories. Alas, they also share stories where customers were less than delighted. Those stories create teachable moments for improving future customer experiences. <br/>  </li><p> You might think &hellip; I&rsquo;m not Mercedes-Benz! I don&rsquo;t have their budget. How does someone like me transform my customer experience without breaking the bank?</p><p> In truth, Mercedes-Benz USA leaders mobilized their staff and the employees at their more than 370 plus dealerships by  <strong>  prioritizing the customer  </strong> and reprioritizing existing programs and resources to serve them. They didn&rsquo;t spend their way to success! You can do the same.</p><p> Study the best, set audacious customer experience goals, listen, map out your customer journey, leverage feedback, and maintain a robust conversation about customer needs, victories, and opportunities within your organization.</p>",

    "title": "Is Your Financial Advisor Prescribing Before Diagnosing?",
    "link": "is-your-financial-advisor-prescribing-before-diagnosing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Some so-called financial advisors refer to themselves as financial doctors. We expect much from our doctors. Many doctors are awesome. I credit my kids to my own fortunate second opinion. Hopefully you will benefit.</p><h3> Financial Advisor- Solutions before advice <br/>  </h3><p> You go to the doctor&rsquo;s office with a stomachache. The doctor says that he has come across this amazing medication that he wants to talk to you about. It has shown to help with mental alertness. You tell him your stomach hurts. The doctor tells you that he has done a lot of research on this mental alertness medication and he feels it would be a great solution for you to consider.  He writes out a prescription and you start taking it.</p><p> After taking it, you feel more mentally alert but your ache persists. What if you found out that the doctor was not a general practitioner. In fact, the doctor is affiliated with a company that distributes mental alertness medication. In fact, he prescribes it to everyone he meets. What if the doctor generated a commission for prescribing the mental alertness medication. What if you found out that one of the side effects was a stomachache?</p><h3> Financial Advisor- Advice before solutions</h3><p> <br/> Now, even more sick, you decide to get a second opinion. The next doctor says not to worry about payment. They want to first determine if they can help you. When you meet the doctor, they ask you a series of questions, like family history, diet and exercise, etc. During this initial consultation the doctor does an overall wellness check. You share that some other items have been bugging you but you&rsquo;ve learned to live with them. You also learn about some things that you didn&rsquo;t even know you concern you. Now that you feel comfortable that this doctor can help you, you want to move forward.</p><p> The doctor says I feel that I can help you, but I need some more information before I can determine a course of care. The doctor sends you home with a checklist of information to gather together and bring with you to the next consultation. Between your first and second meeting with the doctor you receive a letter or email summarizing your prior consultation.</p><p> Are you feeling more mentally alert from the attentive bedside manner? You show up to next meeting with all of the information and medications you are taking from previous &ldquo;financial doctors&rdquo;. While discussing your information, you realize there is a high probability that your stomachache is being caused by some of your other health issues. The doctor then presents their diagnostic process. It is intended to not only address your stomachache, but improve your overall wealth care. After you&rsquo;re feeling better, she will monitor your health on an ongoing basis, to make sure you maintain this new level of wellness. You&rsquo;ve admitted to backsliding in the past. This process won&rsquo;t let you fall too far down. Now how do you feel? Maybe the stomachache was caused by the nerves of your poor financial health.</p><h3> Financial Advisor- Where&rsquo;s the catch? <br/>  </h3><p> How do you pay? While there is no third-party, wealth insurance, the doctor indicates that you will pay for this service by paying a fee based on all the information you have supplied. If you need prescriptions you can either buy them from the doctor or you can shop around and buy them elsewhere. The doctor feels that the most important part is for you to understand why you need the service.</p><h3> Did you really want to say financial planner that is accredited?</h3><p> <br/> So why haven&rsquo;t you found this financial advisor yet? Historically the industry has been driven by financial services product manufacturers. Likely a few come to mind. While many people use the term financial advisor, many are actually recommending you buy what they have in inventory and not advising you on your options. What I have explained here requires you to work with someone that can be compensated for advice only. That means that the financial advisor must hold the registration to charge a fee. You can still buy commissioned based financial services from your current broker(s) once the &ldquo;financial planner&rdquo; determines the prescription. I recommend using a financial planner that has an  <u>  <a href=\"http://envisionwealth.us/are-you-being-victimized-by-a-predatory-wealth-adviser/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   accredited designation  </a> </u> , such as a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; professional.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As the economic recovery begins to gain traction, employers &ndash; both big and small &ndash; will be in the hunt for new talent at all levels within their companies, up to and including the executive suite. The question is,  <strong>  will they hire the best people or future problems? </strong></p><p> When hiring at any level, an employer &ndash; before they even sit opposite a prospective job candidate &ndash; should have the following information completed:</p><li> An updated and complete position description that accurately describes the &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; of the position, i.e., the primary role the incumbent performs and how the position &ldquo;fits in&rdquo; to the unit&rsquo;s operations.</li><li> An accurate listing of the key tasks (probably no more than 10).</li><li> An accurate description of the skills and knowledge needed for the incumbent to perform the tasks in a consistent and satisfactory manner.</li><li> An accurate description of the criteria for evaluation for the position, i.e., how performance will be measured.</li><li> A preliminary list of questions they will ask a candidate to determine how the candidate measures up versus the job requirements. Additional questions will need to be developed once the hiring manager has an actual applicant to consider.</li><li> Finally, they will need a method and a tool to properly evaluate the answers a candidate will offer to the questions asked. The need for this process is critical when more than one person will interview the candidate.</li><li> In some cases, an employer will use an assessment tool to evaluate the applicant. There are some great tools on the market. Most will measure the candidate to the requirements of your open position. Some assessments will even give you additional questions to ask the candidate based on the answers to the questions asked in the assessment. <br/>  </li><p> So, with all of the above completed and on hand, the hiring manager is ready to interview&hellip;or are they? All of this critical preparation can go right out the window if the hiring manager doesn&rsquo;t approach or see the interview process as probably the most important task they are asked to perform. They are bringing in resources (your team) &ndash; expensive ones &ndash; to help the company achieve its mission and goals. These &ldquo;resources&rdquo; interact with your customers who pay you! When your team delivers good or better service on a consistent basis you&rsquo;ve got a real good chance to succeed. If the opposite occurs &ndash; well, you know &ndash; it gets ugly and it happens pretty fast.</p><p> Yet, despite the broad impact the wrong hires can have on a company, many hiring managers approach the interview as an afterthought or&ldquo;something they have to do&rdquo;. How many times have you seen a hiring manager go from a meeting right into the interview or finish a call as they sit at their desk to meet the applicant for the very first time! Here&rsquo;s my favorite: they look at the candidate&rsquo;s application for the first time, right after they sit down to meet the individual. To make matters worse, they usually have no idea what questions they will ask or why they are asking them. Last but not least, they talk too much in the interview and never listen to what the candidate is saying (or not saying). They are winging it, which is probably their standard modus operandi! &ldquo;Winging it&rdquo; when hiring is the best way to create a future disaster!</p><p> Any hiring manager needs to take the time to prepare for the interview using the information previously shared. Under normal circumstances, it might take 15 to 30 minutes&mdash;a timeframe that is insignificant when you consider the cost in time and money associated with hiring the wrong candidate, a future problem.</p><p> Hiring new employees into a company has a fair amount of risk associated with it. With preparation before the interview, that risk is reduced. It can be reduced even more by following a professional and comprehensive approach during the interview. Finally, the risk can be made acceptable (never zero) with a consistent and logical approach to assessing the candidate to arrive at the correct &ldquo;hire / no hire&rdquo; decision. Best employee or future problem; mediocre team or great performers; average company or superior company &ndash; it&rsquo;s your choice and it starts with the hiring process. Go ahead, keep winging it!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> While it is true that mistakes offer us great opportunities to learn, it's still better to not make mistakes at all, especially if you are holding a leadership role in your organization.</p><p> In this article, we'll talk about 5 of the most common management errors leaders are likely to commit and what you can do to avoid them. Learning these things early on in your career as a manager will spare you from a lot of trouble.</p><h3> 1. Failure to provide feedback</h3><p> <br/> When you're not able to give prompt feedback to your people, it's like depriving them of the opportunity to become better and perform better. You have to make them aware of what they are doing wrong because unless they are formally informed of the problem, they will continue making the same mistakes in the future.</p><h3> 2. Not being there for your people when they need you <br/>  </h3><p> As a leader, you have so many things to do and think about, so it's going to be hard for you to be available to your team. Yes, there are deadlines to beat, but you have to make an effort to have time for your people. If you're consistently not available when they need you, they won't get the support and guidance they need to be able to complete their tasks correctly.</p><p> To avoid this mistake, block out time in your schedule for your people. Have time to talk to them personally and listen to their concerns. Be aware of their needs so they would know they can count on you when they need your help.</p><h3> 3. Being excessively hands-off</h3><p> <br/> There is always a possibility that one of your team will misunderstood a task or a project's specification. When you don't stay in touch with this member while he or she is working on it, you won't be able to spot their mistakes, and it may be too late for you to correct those in the end.</p><p> Micromanagement is something that many leaders want to avoid. Yes, you shouldn't micromanage your people, but this doesn't mean that you should not care at all! It's important that you keep the balance just right.</p><h3> 4. Being very and too friendly <br/>  </h3><p> Many managers want to be seen as \"cool\" managers. They believe that this is key to keeping their people happy. Yes, workers are happier with a friendly manager, but you have to remember that there are tough decisions you need to make regarding some people in your team. You don't want your friendship with a member make it hard for you to do the right thing. You also don't want any of them to take advantage of your friendship with them.</p><p> Again, this doesn't mean you shouldn't try to socialize with your workers anymore. The success of your team is also affected by the kind of relationship you build with them. You just need to keep the balance between being the boss and being a friend.</p><h3> 5. Misunderstanding what motivates people <br/>  </h3><p> You may think that money is the ultimate motivator of employees. But well, it is NOT. Many leaders are wrong in assuming that their people are working only to make money.</p><p> You have to understand that there are many other things that can keep a person motivated and engaged in their jobs or careers, such as career advancement, work/life balance, and so on.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/what-is-mentoring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   As a manager  </a> </u> , it is your job to determine what drives your people to work with dedication and use them to keep them inspired and motivated.</p>",

    "link": "the-rise-of-online-robo-registered-investment-adviser-ria-firms",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a></p><p> It's hard to go a day without reading about the emergence of online registered investment adviser (RIA) firms. These firms have taken on many names including:</p><li> Online Advisors</li><li> E-Advisors</li><li> Robo Advisors</li><li> Internet Advisors <br/>  </li><p> However, there hasn't been much analysis done looking at the present number of these types of firms and the number of new such firms starting up for the first time as online advisory firms.</p><p> <strong>  How many Online or Robo Investment Adviser Firms are there Today? </strong></p><p> Fortunately,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/invafoia.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   public data provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  </a> </u>  provides some great insights. Since 2003, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2091.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC has provided an exemption for \"Internet Investment Advisers\"  </a> </u>  to register as an RIA firm at the federal level with the SEC regardless of the firm's level of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-calculate-investment-adviser-regulatory-assets-under-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   regulatory assets under management (AUM)  </a> </u>  as long as the firm meets the definition established under  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/275.203A-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rule 203A-2(f)  </a> </u> . The existence of this exemption allows us to take a look at the number of investment advisory firms currently registered with the SEC that are utilizing this exemption.</p><p> As of December 1, 2005, there are 12,026 total firms registered with the SEC. Of those 12,026, 107 firms are currently using the \"Internet Investment Adviser\" exemption to qualify for federal registration. Thus, today around 0.89% of federally-registered investment advisory firms are clearly defined as advisory firms operating either exclusively or primarily as an online or e-advisor. However, it's important to also include the large number of state-registered RIA firms as part of our analysis. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://meridian-iq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meridian-IQ  </a> </u> , including state-registered RIA firms which far outnumber the number of SEC-registered firms, the total number of investment advisory climbs to 33,671 meaning that roughly 0.32% of all investment advisers are operating as an internet-only firm (107 of 33,671).</p><p> <strong>  How many new Online or Robo Investment Adviser Firms are being Started each year? </strong></p><p> Although the number of online RIAs today represents a very small percentage of the industry, the number of new robo advisors being created each year is accelerating as illustrated in the chart below:</p><p> <img alt=\"Number Of Online Robo Advisors Started Per Year\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hubfs/NumberOfOnlineRoboAdvisorsPerYear.png?t=1449155755618\"/></p><p> To provide some additional perspective, in the 12 month period concluding on May 31, 2015,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/no-consolidation-the-ria-industry-continues-to-become-more-fragmented\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Meridian-IQ estimates that there were 2,241 new RIA firms started  </a> </u> . Thus, as of late, roughly 2.59% of new investment advisory firms being started are online or e-advisory firms (58 of 2,241 firms). While this is still a small percentage of new firms being launched, it does represent a more than 7x increase relative to the present 0.32% of total RIA firms that internet advisers currently represent.</p><p> <strong>  Does this Analysis include all Online or Robo Investment Adviser Firms? </strong></p><p> It is also important to note that looking just at advisory firms that rely on this exemption to register with the SEC does slightly under estimate the total number of online RIA firms. As an example, both  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wealthfront.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wealthfront  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.betterment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Betterment  </a> </u> , two of today's most prominent robo advisors, no longer rely on this exemption to register with the SEC as their AUM levels have climbed well above $100 million making the exemption no longer necessary to maintain the firm's federal registration. The same can be said for a handful of other online advisory firms as well. Thus, the total number of firms operating exclusively or primary as an internet advisory firm is probably closer to ~120 firms, or 1.00% of all SEC-registered RIA firms and 0.36% of all investment advisers (120 of 33,671). </p><p> In addition, this total does not include the emergence of traditional  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-guide-to-online-rias-and-robo-advisors-that-serve-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA firms that are now adding online advisory capabilities to their firm  </a> </u>  as a secondary or separate business line, as it is likely that the vast majority of these firms are already registered today as a traditional investment advisory firm at the state or federal level. We continue to see an increasing number of traditional advisory firms exploring this option. </p><p> As  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-choose-an-ria-compliance-consultant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA compliance consultants  </a> </u> , we are happy to further discuss how to start and register as an online RIA firm or how to best add online or robo advisor capabilities to your existing RIA firm in a compliant manner. In addition, our latest technology infographic also provides a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/download-the-2015-ria-technology-landscape-infographic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   list of automated portfolio management providers serving investment advisers  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m not a fortune-teller and I haven&rsquo;t met anyone yet who can accurately predict the future.  However, I do watch trends in social media marketing and feel it&rsquo;s important that I share this information with the financial services markets so we aren&rsquo;t so far behind!</p><p> Social media has been a tough place for our industry.  Whether you want to say it is compliance or the overwhelming nature of data itself, as a community of professionals we must pick a few areas and really go for it&hellip;especially in 2016.  You see, it&rsquo;s getting to the point where catching up is extremely difficult.</p><h3> I believe 2016 is a make it or break it year for us.</h3><p> <br/> This is the year where we play or get played.</p><p> So why not try concentrating on one [or all three] of these areas as part of your business plan for 2016?  If you need help or have questions, please contact me!  I want to see you be successful!</p><p> Here are my three big predictions for 2016:</p><h3> 1.  Video Killed the Radio Star in 1979 &ndash; &ndash; and still is. </h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t go anywhere online without a video playing.  When Buggles sang the song &ldquo;Video Killed the Radio Star&rdquo; they could not have possibly been able to predict how true that would be in 2016.  Some 37 years later and we are using video for damn near everything.</p><p> Video has lead to live streaming with tools such as Meerkat and Periscope, but I don&rsquo;t see the financial services market jumping on that bandwagon quickly (compliance!!) but these tools are invading our everyday space.  Did you see the story of the police who caught the woman who live streamed her drunk driving?  The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/13/us/woman-live-streams-drunk-driving/\" target=\"_blank\">   police (a lot like financial services) didn&rsquo;t even know what Periscope was and after people called in to report the young woman  </a> </u> , they had to figure out how to download the app and find her.  Video is powerful, folks.</p><p> Who would have thought YouTube would be considered a dinosaur of video&hellip;but it is.  When is the last time you went on Facebook without seeing a video auto-playing? Realize you are competing with videos from big brands too &ndash; so make &rsquo;em count!</p><p> One company in Indiana is doing it right for financial service professionals too.   <a href=\"http://www.covideo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Covideo  </u>    </a> in Indianapolis, Indiana has figured out how to make video for email easy and affordable.  You can turn your emails into a tool for face-to-face and just-in-time interactions with your clients.  If you&rsquo;re a financial services professional and want to use video in 2016, I have an affordable arrangement set-up with Covideo to have access to their Enterprise account at the Premium account price.   <u>  <a href=\"mailto:socialmedia@ashbrokerage.com\">   Contact me for more information  </a> </u>  and to get started.</p><h3> 2.  Email &ndash; &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just a fad, I promise.  </h3><p> <br/> There was a smidge of sarcasm in my lead-in as I remember the days of people who said email would never stick around.  How many of you remember getting your first email address?  AOL?  NetZero?  Yahoo?  Yep &ndash; those were the days!</p><p> Today, though, email has taken on a different look and feel.  You want your email to be more original, incorporate video (see #1 above) and provide value to the person it&rsquo;s bugging (and that&rsquo;s all email is &ndash; a disruptor, stop trying to make it something more than it is).   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/crestodina\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Andy Crestodina  </a> </u>  of Orbit Media  <u>  <a href=\"http://topdogsocialmedia.com/13-digital-marketing-experts-make-bold-predictions-for-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   is quoted as reminding that quality project  </a>  s </u> are a must!  He&rsquo;s right &ndash; we have to up our game!</p><p> <u>  Send me a sample of an email campaign that you&rsquo;ve done </u>  &ndash; I will critique it. You want to build influence with your email, provide help to challenging situations, all the while funneling your audience back to a site where you can convert them.  It&rsquo;s not an easy task.  If you&rsquo;re trying to do this as a financial service professional, you might need some help&hellip;I&rsquo;m just saying!</p><p> For example, are your emails visually appealing?  Do your emails look different on a desktop vs. a mobile device?  Are you using a quality (yet affordable) email provider to build campaigns that are trackable and provide feedback?  If you want, I can help you dig deeper and better understand this.  Emails should help build the Know-Like-Trust factor.  They shouldn&rsquo;t be something self-serving and bothersome to your readership.</p><h3> 3.  Guess what &ndash; content AND context are king!  </h3><p> <br/> Content with context is not for the faint of heart.  I recommend those who want to move the needle in 2016 as a thought leader to get real with their audience.  Stop being polite and get to the point of what you want them to know, learn, experience, feel and share.</p><p> Content with context lets you take your relationship-building to the next level.  My friend,  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nealschaffer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Neal Schaffer </a> , of  <a href=\"http://topdogsocialmedia.com/13-digital-marketing-experts-make-bold-predictions-for-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Maximize Social  </u>    </a> Business <a href=\"http://topdogsocialmedia.com/13-digital-marketing-experts-make-bold-predictions-for-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ,  <u>   says it best, &ldquo;I am going to be investing more in technology to help me expand relationships that I have created online.  </u> </a> &rdquo;  You can only have the right conversations with the right people when you stop being a robot and start being a human being.</p><p> Financial service professionals have mastered the business persona.  We know all the right answers for asset management, wealth creation, income protection, legacy planning, etc.  Those are very important issues, but I guarantee Grumpy Cat is going beat you out every time because the stuff we talk about isn&rsquo;t fun or funny.  So, how do we change this?  For one, we start being more like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/brittneycastro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brittney Castro  </a> </u>  of Financially Wise Women.   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/brittneycastro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   She&rsquo;s not afraid to be as silly  </u>    </a> as she is serious about money and financial planning.  She has the content WITH the context &ndash; &ndash; that&rsquo;s the secret sauce, folks.  (Go follow her too &ndash; she&rsquo;s pretty cool!)</p><p> Understanding that consumers are in control now is vitally important.  They pick what they want to see (to a large degree, at least).  They pick what they want to talk about.  They pick what will be shared.  Their expectation is about a relationship, some recognition, and a conversation.  The question you need to ask yourself is, &ldquo;Am I providing this to my clients?&rdquo;  If you have to think for more than one second how to answer this, then you&rsquo;re not doing your job right in marketing your business correctly.  That&rsquo;s 100% your fault, but in your defense, you&rsquo;ve never had to spend so much time thinking about this question.  That&rsquo;s why there are marketing folks out there you need to work with to help you out.</p><p> Any questions &ndash; let me know how I can help.  Make 2016 your year!  Stop being behind and get out in front of the pack!  You got this!</p><p> Be Bigger, Better and more BIONIC today!</p>",
