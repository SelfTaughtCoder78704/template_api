It&rsquo;s a great question, and there are a lot of great answers. I could give you, at least, <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brownelltravel.com/reasons-to-use-a-travel-agent/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fifty reasons why you need a travel advisor  </a> </u> , but, in honor of number one on my list, I&rsquo;m going to get to the point and share my top five.</p><h3> Time&mdash;We all wish we had more of it.</h3><p> <br/> The hours you spend sifting through the <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=hotel+in+new+york&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8\" target=\"_blank\">   600+ MILLION results for &ldquo;hotel in New York&rdquo;  </a> </u> (yes, that&rsquo;s how many results there are!) could be spent enjoying time with family and friends. I will edit the world for you. As a travel advisor, I have the resources, connections, and experience necessary to sort quickly through the clutter and provide you with a trip that is unlike anything you can book yourself. </p><h3> Value&mdash;Who doesn&rsquo;t want more value for each dollar spent?</h3><p> <br/> As a Virtuoso-affiliated Advisor, I can access exclusive benefits and amenities that people cannot get any other way. (Think: upgrade, complimentary breakfast, $100 food and beverage or spa credit, and free Wi-Fi.) Brownell Travel, the company I selected to affiliate with after a lot of research, is also a member of many <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brownelltravel.com/brownell-advantage/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   preferred partner programs  </a> </u> , including <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brownelltravel.com/brownell-advantage/ritz-carlton-stars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ritz-Carlton STARS  </a> </u> , <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brownelltravel.com/brownell-advantage/four-seasons-preferred-partner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Four Seasons Preferred Partner  </a> </u> , and <a href=\"http://www.brownelltravel.com/brownell-advantage/peninsula-hotels-penclub/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Peninsula PenClub  </u>  , </a> so I can access even more exclusive amenities and benefits for you!  </p><h3> Customization&mdash;A travel advisor&rsquo;s recommendations are tailored specifically to you.</h3><p> <br/> When you use a travel advisor, you get to speak with a real person in real time. We listen to you and create a travel experience that takes into account all of your unique wants and needs. We do not base our recommendations on an algorithm that would recommend the same cookie-cutter package to 125,000 other travelers. And if you have questions or concerns at any point during your travels, I&rsquo;m available to help you. You have a safety net that you won&rsquo;t have if you book online yourself.</p><h3> Access&mdash;Perhaps one of the most exciting reasons to use a travel advisor is the access we have to exclusive, one-of-a-kind experiences.</h3><p> <br/> Through my partnerships, I can help you realize your wildest dreams. Do you fancy an afternoon with Lady Grantham? I can arrange a private tour of Highclere Castle, the setting for Downton Abbey, followed by a meet and greet with an actor from the show. Or would you rather island hop on your private, fully-staffed yacht in the Seychelles? If you&rsquo;ve dreamed it, I can arrange it.</p><h3> VIP Experience&mdash;You don&rsquo;t have to be a celebrity to travel like one.</h3><p> <br/> Your travel advisor not only communicates your preferences and needs to travel suppliers but also makes sure you are &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. ____&rdquo; . . . not Reservation #471894. Brownell Travel has spent 128 years building amazing relationships with travel providers and partners around the world. In turn, our travel partners look forward to hosting our clients and treat them like VIPs.</p><p> Whatever trip you&rsquo;re planning, there are serious advantages to using a travel advisor. Our knowledge of the travel industry, experience, partnerships, connections, and access allow us to create unique, customized experiences you won&rsquo;t soon forget. And the time and money you save can be used on another trip!</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 14:27:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 14:27:44.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_ACh0uxg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-reasons-why-you-should-use-a-travel-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"8800\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 14:27:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 14:27:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-reasons-why-you-should-use-a-travel-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8799\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4181\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Five-Reasons-Why-You-Should-Use-a-Travel-Advisor.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"948\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453838400,"author_id":95,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4028,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Absolute Musts to Provide the Best Customer Service","link":"3-absolute-musts-to-provide-the-best-customer-service","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Ever wonder why some companies lead their industry while others as always seem to be chasing them? It&rsquo;s simple really.</h3><p> <br/> It usually comes down to a few key areas customers consider important. Every human being on the planet wants a nice product and great service. Of course, they need to be able to afford whatever you&rsquo;re providing. The value is critical.</p><p> Overall, however, we can strip it all down to these three absolute musts to provide the best customer service:</p><h3> The Question</h3><p> <br/> Read all the books you want about satisfying customers and building your faithful followers, but nothing is more important than knowing what the customers truly value.</p><p> You can ask them what they consider great customer service. You&rsquo;ll undoubtedly get some helpful insight, 90% of which you probably already knew before you asked.</p><p> If you want a bulletproof technique to yield some surprises, ask &ldquo;What level of service would you require from us to never consider using one of our competitors?&rdquo;</p><p> Of course, you&rsquo;ll need to tailor this question a bit if you&rsquo;re providing solely a product. Alter as appropriate.</p><h3> The Delivery</h3><p> <br/> You can under-deliver, deliver, or over-deliver what the customers expect. The best customer service, however, requires more or faster or whatever is appropriate for over-delivering your product and service.</p><p> Delivering what your competitors deliver simply means you run the risk of becoming invisible, squeezed on price, or both. Ewwww. Leave that for the competition.</p><h3> The Bonus</h3><p> <br/> People love (good) surprises! Toss in some complimentary bonuses or giveaways or coupons for free stuff. Throw in whatever you can build or have at your disposal.</p><p> Some might consider this over-delivering, but these bonuses should truly be separate, distinct, and in addition to whatever product or service you&rsquo;re providing.</p><p> The extras are the &ldquo;stand-outs&rdquo; in people&rsquo;s minds. They might be pleased you delivered something faster, but they&rsquo;ll never forget you augmented your offering with truly additional value.</p><p> An added benefit of including extras is you&rsquo;re providing yourself or your company additional opportunities to show your customers you have other offerings or services they might find beneficial. This, of course, can lead to more chances for you to over-perform!</p><h3> A Few Examples&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s really quite easy to apply these principles no matter your profession, service or product.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s something off the top of my head because I&rsquo;m desperately in need of one. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a massage therapist. Why not roll on for an extra ten minutes if the customer&rsquo;s schedule allows? Toss in a few sample lotions or oils or discount coupons for subsequent visits. Who doesn&rsquo;t love these bonuses?</p><p> Perhaps you sell a product. I just bought an Internet streaming device the other day. The retail salesperson took extra time and care educating me on the different options. After I bought the product, got home, and opened the bag, I noticed coupons for enough movie rentals to more than pay for the device. Bonuses!</p><h3> One For The Road&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Like it or not, the world works much differently today than it did several years ago. In many situations, it&rsquo;ll be beneficial to do these activities in reverse order. That&rsquo;s right. First, you give stuff away. Then someone or some company gives you an opportunity to over-deliver. Then they give you a chance to keep them forever.</p><p> I always love to hear from you: What are your best techniques for providing great customer service?</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 14:41:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 14:41:59.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_W2IfNBR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-absolute-musts-to-provide-the-best-customer-service/\", \"post_id\": \"8802\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 14:41:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 14:41:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-absolute-musts-to-provide-the-best-customer-service\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8801\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4182\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/3-Absolute-Musts-to-Provide-the-Best-Customer-Service.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"678\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453827600,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4029,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Controllable Developments to Grow Sales","link":"controllable-developments-to-grow-sales","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Back in 2008, I went to Harvard Business School to do a course on strategic marketing. Before the course started, we had to send in a short essay on our business drivers. Business drivers are developments under your control that directly grow sales.</p><p> For instance, if I had an ice-cream parlor, the weather would be a driver for sales. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t control it, so the weather doesn&rsquo;t count as a business driver. However, watching it eaten also drives ice-cream consumption. Especially by those who crave it. So advertising my ice-cream health benefits in diet magazines, may turn out to be a business driver. Or opening other parlors in streets full of restaurants could be another.</p><p> Astonishingly, many companies don&rsquo;t fully know what those drivers are, or they understand their drivers but don&rsquo;t measure them correctly.</p><p> If I had a recipe for business drivers, I&rsquo;d be filthy rich. Unfortunately, finding one&rsquo;s business drivers is a matter of ongoing trial and error. Value propositions change, markets change, and so do the developments that drive profitability.</p><h3> There Are As Many Business Drivers As There Are Businesses in the Market</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Business drivers: leading indicators of growth that are actionable by YOU </strong></p><p> Business drivers depend on the specific match between industry and customer base. They differ from adding retail space, to speed of service, to direct marketing. You name it.</p><p> Contrary to popular belief, customer satisfaction isn&rsquo;t always a business driver. Take home appliances. These are low-volume products, which you only buy every once in a while, and only because you need them. If market research revealed that current customers were unhappy with the appliance&rsquo;s performance, fixing the problem would not have a direct and immediate impact on sales.</p><p> However, one business driver is over-represented in all industries: innovativeness. We have to underpromise and overdeliver, delight and surprise, and there&rsquo;s no better way than innovation to do so. If you don&rsquo;t want to start a price spiral and get stuck with the consequences, that is.</p><h3> Innovativeness</h3><p> <br/> It doesn&rsquo;t mean boasting the innovativeness of a product. Neither does emphasis on the R&amp;D budget or percentage of time spent on &ldquo;free&rdquo; thinking help profitability. Innovativeness is a means, not a goal.</p><p> <strong>  The driver is: translating latent, dormant, and unmet customer needs into the pipeline of innovations! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 14:45:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 14:45:00.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_x1X7uox.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/controllable-developments-to-grow-sales/\", \"post_id\": \"8804\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 14:45:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 14:45:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"controllable-developments-to-grow-sales\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8803\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4183\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Controllable-Developments-to-Grow-Sales.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"455\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453804200,"author_id":52,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4030,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What I Learned About Myself When Changing Jobs","link":"what-i-learned-about-myself-when-changing-jobs","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amy_sitnick\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Amy Sitnick  </u> </a></p><p> You may have seen that I recently announced that I left SEI - a company that I loved, a mature social media program that I was proud of and was recognized industry-wide, and colleagues and clients that were more than just work relationships &ndash; they were true friends. </p><h3> Why would I do that? Honestly, even I thought I was crazy.</h3><p> <br/> However, there were many signs pushing me in a new direction. For one, I met  <u>  <a href=\"http://luanncahn.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LuAnn Cahn  </a> </u>  &ndash; Philadelphia journalist and inspirational author of the book, I Dare Me last year, and she lectures a lot about how pushing yourself to do new things can change your life. I also attended the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.paconferenceforwomen.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PA Conference for Women  </a> </u> . There were so many talks devoted to women seizing opportunities and climbing the corporate ladder. </p><p> And here I was with an opportunity to build social media again, at another company recognized by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.phillymag.com/business/2015/10/25/coolest-companies-philadelphia-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Philadelphia Magazine  </a> </u>  as a coolest place to work. </p><p> So here I am starting the New Year, at a new company, and with so many insights into life and work. </p><p> It was only a matter of time before I took to blogging to let you know what I've been up to. Here are some of the key themes of my transition that might benefit you too:</p><p> <strong>  Change is hard:  </strong> People always say that, but it&rsquo;s harder than you think. Leaving an established role can make you feel vulnerable, perhaps leading you to ask, &ldquo;Will I succeed in another organization?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s important to recognize those feelings, but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s important to find inner confidence. Perhaps it&rsquo;s leaning on a personal coach, reading up on the industry to feel more prepared, getting other areas of your life organized so you can devote your whole self to your work. I did all of those things and it helped me find my footing. You can too. Know your new company hired you for a reason &ndash; you have specialized knowledge that you bring to the organization. You help complete the puzzle of their organization in a new and different way.</p><p> <strong>  Relationships go beyond work: </strong>  Especially in the day and age of social media, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to stay in touch with your network. Those relationships really don&rsquo;t go away upon leaving a company. Sure you don&rsquo;t see everyone at the same frequency as before, but those relationships last. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t say goodbye when I left; I said, &ldquo;See you soon.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to you, however, to stay in touch and nurture your friendships. I have to tell you, I&rsquo;ve been spending more time on the phone &ndash; actually talking to people &ndash; than ever before. If you&rsquo;re not face-to-face, phone-to-phone helps for quality time.</p><p> <strong>  Audiobooks and podcasts are your friends: </strong>  I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I never seem to have time to read. At the end of the day (literally, not figuratively), I&rsquo;m so tired that when I climb into bed, I crash. Hard. So now that I have a longer commute, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed listening to the Serial podcast and listening to audiobooks. (I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll throw in some tunes and Howard Stern interviews soon.)</p><p> <strong>  Having a Framework Helps:  </strong> Speaking of audiobooks, a mentor of mine gave me the book, &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/First-90-Days-Strategies-Expanded/dp/1422188612/ref=sr_1_1/190-7280038-4715734?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453730492&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+first+90+day\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The First 90 Days.  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  It has been more helpful than I even imagined. I have the hardback and audio version for the car. To get up and running, I&rsquo;m focused on learning the business, meeting my colleagues, embracing the culture and most importantly, contributing to the organization in a meaningful way. I&rsquo;ve already referred the book to a handful of people who are going through similar situations. Since other people have helped me through my transition, I&rsquo;d love to share what resources have been helpful to me with others.</p><p> <strong>  Kids are resilient:  </strong> Lastly, I was mostly concerned about how my children would react to a new routine. I&rsquo;m a working mom &ndash; full time devoted to both. I love my career and it&rsquo;s important that my children see me as a role model and contributor to our family. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m very devoted to my home life and being a very present parent (this weekend&rsquo;s snow storm made for lots of quality time to say the least!). I'm happy to report that the kids are doing well and know I&rsquo;m still their number one cheerleader. It&rsquo;s absolutely appropriate here to give a big shout out to my husband,  <u>  Anthony Erjavec </u> . As  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg\" target=\"_blank\">   Sheryl Sandberg  </a> </u>  says, the most important career decision you can make is who you select as a husband and that couldn&rsquo;t be more true.

Rosenberg, Head of ETF Capital Markets &amp; Analytics </p><p> As you determine which ETFs best meet your clients&rsquo; needs and objectives, bear in mind ETF liquidity and trading. This will help you better maximize opportunities and optimize trades at the best possible price in order to gain potentially higher total returns. A common misconception holds that to get &ldquo;best execution,&rdquo; an ETF must possess significant average daily trading volume. ETFs actually have three levels of liquidity:</p><li> Secondary market</li><li> Market depth</li><li> Primary market <br/>  </li><p> Examining the level of liquidity of a specific ETF will help determine its appropriate trading strategy.</p><p> We often hear this question from our investors: Can I trade an ETF with low average daily volume (ADV) or less-liquid underlying holdings without moving the price? The answer requires an advisor to have an understanding of how ETF trading works, including the various levels of ETF liquidity and techniques to help achieve best execution when trading ETFs.</p><h3> <strong>  ETF VOLUME ALONE DOES NOT EQUAL LIQUIDITY </strong></h3><p> <br/> First, it is critical to understand that ETFs trade quite differently than stocks and other investments. The reason: The intrinsic value of an ETF reflects the value of its underlying securities. A common misconception holds that to get best execution, an ETF must possess significant average daily trading volume. But onscreen volume isn&rsquo;t a proxy for ETF liquidity. That&rsquo;s because executed share volume pertains only to the secondary market exchanges on which the ETFs trade.* ETFs actually have three levels of liquidity across the primary and secondary markets. Consequently, average daily trading volume delivers an incomplete measure of actual liquidity. As Exhibit 1 on the next page illustrates, roughly 7% of all listed ETFs comprise about 87% of ETF volume. Generally, these ETFs are based on standard benchmarks, or they are leveraged or inverse ETFs. A leveraged ETF aims to deliver two or three times the return on its stated index, while an inverse ETF tries to deliver returns that  are the opposite of the index&rsquo;s returns.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"234\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Flexsharea-1.png\" width=\"549\"/></p><p> More than 64% of all ETFs trade less than 50,000 shares per day. Most often, these encompass specialized or alpha-generating strategies. Alpha-generating securities, when added to an existing portfolio, attempt to create excess returns above a preselected benchmark index. As a result of the various liquidity sources across the markets, these ETFs can be traded as effectively as those with greater daily exchange volume. MULTIPLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY To effect optimal trades, it is valuable to know and understand the various sources of ETF liquidity (see Exhibit 2).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"203\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Flexshares-2.png\" width=\"518\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Level One </strong></h3><p> <br/> You may be familiar with the National Best Bid Offer (NBBO), the publicly available view of the secondary market used to pull up quotes. It also is known as the &ldquo;inside&rdquo; market. It displays the best bid (the price at which a security may be sold) and the best ask (the price at which a security may be bought) available. The difference is known as the bid/ask spread, which is determined by market makers who post quotes through an exchange (see Exhibit 3). Because an ETF generally is a single security that represents a portfolio of securities, the pricing of its underlying securities substantiates its value. In effect, an ETF&rsquo;s price only moves as much as the price of its underlying basket of securities, as published each day by the ETF sponsor. </p><p> ETFs trade on exchanges continuously throughout the day, much like single stocks. Unlike stocks, however, the number of ETF shares outstanding may rise or decline because of a unique creation and redemption process. It allows an ETF to trade significantly more shares than the exchange ADV statistics reveal. (The creation and redemption process is discussed further in the section entitled Level Three.)</p><h3> <strong>  Level Two </strong></h3><p> <br/> National Best Bid Offer quotations are constructed from the best bid and ask with the largest size, available from market makers who post quotes through an exchange. However, the depth of the ETF marketplace isn&rsquo;t reflected in the NBBO. ETF quotes from market makers often have higher ask and lower bid prices with larger size than those shown on NBBO. You can access these quotes through relationships with market makers (also known as liquidity providers), through subscription access via a quote system, or through a custodian trade desk. Trading firms may choose to assume positional or proprietary trading risk for ETFs and other securities. A lead market maker for specific securities must post all day long a two-sided quote, which is a firm bid price and a firm ask price that it&rsquo;s willing to honor. Other market makers have the option of showing two-sided or one-sided quotes as needed, or showing nothing at all. For a large order, contact a block desk. Block desks are staffed with trained professionals who will help determine how best to execute a large trade (see section entitled Execution Matters). EXHIBIT 3: NATIONAL BEST BID OFFER FOR TDTT, A FLEXSHARES ETF The National Best Bid Offer price quotations reflect the bid/ask spread as determined by market makers, who post prices through an exchange. Any quote not highlighted in yellow represents additional quotes behind the NBBO. This example shows the market depth for FlexShares iBoxx 3-Year Target Duration TIPS Index Fund (TDTT).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Flexshares-3.png\" width=\"540\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Level Three </strong></h3><p> <br/> The primary market for ETFs emerges through the creation and redemption process, referenced earlier, which makes ETFs open-ended. In a creation transaction, an authorized participant, or AP &ndash; a market maker or a large trading firm that handles all aspects of client activity itself &ndash; assembles a portfolio or basket of securities that comprises the ETF unit. Typically, the portfolio involves 50,000 or 100,000 shares as determined by the ETF sponsor. The AP then turns the basket over to an ETF custodian. In exchange for the basket of securities, the ETF custodian provides shares of the ETF to the AP at the net asset value. In a redemption transaction, the process works in reverse.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"153\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Flexshares-4.png\" width=\"605\"/></p><p> Because of the creation and redemption process (Exhibit 4), an ETF&rsquo;s market price doesn&rsquo;t shift far from the value of the underlying securities, also known as the &ldquo;intrinsic value.&rdquo; Arbitrage opportunity provides an incentive to trading firms to exploit pricing differentials. Since these firms can create ETF shares, the ETF&rsquo;s price aligns with its intrinsic value. Essentially, the creation and redemption process facilitates a pricing discipline for any ETF, based on its underlying holdings.</p><h3> <strong>  ETF TRADING IMPLICATIONS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Spread &ndash; again, the difference between the bid and ask price of a security or asset &ndash; is an important consideration when choosing between and trading ETFs. It can meaningfully impact the cost of investment and, consequently, an investor&rsquo;s potential total return. Cost of Investment Closely examine the cents-per-share spread when evaluating the overall cost of purchasing an ETF. It may appear wise, for example, to buy an ETF with a one-cent spread rather than another with a five-cent spread. However, a one-cent spread on a $10 ETF equals 10 basis points, while a five-cent spread on a $75 ETF equals 6.7 basis points. From this perspective, the $75 ETF has a tighter spread. Potential Total Return The spread affects the long-term performance of an ETF. Suppose you are examining ETFs with similar share prices of about $36. At a one-cent spread, the ETF could be quoted at 36.42-36.43 (bid-ask).</p><li> If you hold the ETF for one year and its price increases 10%, the bid-ask will be 40.06-40.07.</li><li> Because you must buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price, the pretax total return after one year would be 9.97%. <br/>  </li><p> Now assume an order was entered that caused a 10-cent spread (36.38-36.48 bid-ask)</p><li> If you owned this ETF for one year and its price rose 10% (40.02-40.12 bid-ask), the pretax total return would be 9.70%.</li><li> The difference between the two examples is 0.27%, demonstrating how the spread impacts your pretax total return. <br/>  </li><p> Time horizon and the investment strategy also can affect the spread:</p><li> The shorter the investment&rsquo;s time horizon, the more impact the spread will have on total return; the longer the time horizon, the less impact it will have.</li><li> Different investment strategies offer different expected rates of return, trading characteristics and liquidity profiles.</li><li> If the ETF is concentrated in less-liquid securities such as corporate bonds, the market depth may be less, possibly causing wider spreads. <br/>  </li><p> When buying or selling larger numbers of ETF shares, the ask tends to move up and the bid tends to move down. The price will move closer to the value of the underlying securities as the number of shares approaches the creation unit size.</p><h3> <strong>  EXECUTION MATTERS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now let&rsquo;s examine how to determine the appropriate trading strategy for a specific ETF, given market conditions. For example, assume that, based on a client&rsquo;s investment objectives, you purchase 30,000 shares of FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF).</p><p> <strong>  Employing the First Level of Liquidity (Secondary Market) First, you must ask: Are there enough shares of QDF available for purchase or sale at the bid or ask price for this trade? </strong></p><li> If the answer is yes, you may enter a limit order to obtain a specific price or a market order to simply acquire the security.</li><li> If the number of available shares on the inside market quote is close to, but less than 30,000, you could break the trade into two orders or enter a limit order for the entire amount.</li><li> If too few shares of QDF exist in the secondary market (which the National Best Bid Offer will indicate) the most effective approach is to call the block desk to help execute the order by accessing the enhanced liquidity that market makers can provide. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Employing the Second Level of Liquidity (Market Depth) </strong></p><p> A block desk or liquidity provider becomes a key resource in executing large trades because of the ability to access the market depth of each security. The block desk will ask whether you want a block order or desire to break the trade up. Furthermore, you will need to determine whether to give the broker or floor trader the discretion to determine the time and price.</p><p> The block desk or liquidity provider offers advice or instructions on how to best execute the trade. For instance, consider the decision whether to enter an order in one block or break it into parts. If you favor breaking up the trade, one option is to use a volume-weighted average price. That price is calculated by adding the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by number of shares traded), then dividing by the total shares traded for the day.</p><p> <strong>  Employing the Third Level of Liquidity (Primary Market) If you cannot break up the order, other choices are available, including: </strong></p><li> A risk trade, a set price that you agree upon with the trading desk executed immediately. If it costs more to trade QDF than the agreed-upon price, the trading firm takes the loss. If it costs less, the trading firm takes the extra money.</li><li> A Net Asset Value (NAV) trade, which will occur at the end of the day at QDF&rsquo;s NAV plus a commission, probably one cent to two cents per share. <br/>  </li><p> Potentially, execution of a block trade offers investors access to the creation and redemption process. The block desk or liquidity provider will determine the best way to execute the trade, which, depending on the firm&rsquo;s size and inventory, may cause a creation and redemption. Note that not all large trades trigger a creation or redemption, but this process helps ensure that investors pay a fair price without moving the market.</p><h3> <strong>  TIMING IS ALSO IMPORTANT </strong></h3><p> <br/> U.S.-based ETFs trade well during U.S. market hours, while European-based ETFs trade better when European markets are open (before noon Eastern Time). Pacific-based ETFs trade well in the afternoon as their market open draws near. You should avoid trading for the first 15 minutes of the market open, which is when all of the underlying securities have opened and prices have been established. The last five minutes before the market close also should be avoided because it becomes more expensive for liquidity providers to hedge securities late in the day, giving them less incentive to execute large trades.</p><h3> <strong>  HOW ETFS CAN HELP </strong></h3><p> <br/> ETFs are powerful tools that can be used to address a number of financial and investment challenges, including:</p><li> Adjusting risk exposure, managing tax liabilities and harvesting losses</li><li> Providing market exposure for short-term cash holdings while minimizing opportunity costs</li><li> Adding or overweighting specific markets, sectors or asset classes in a core portfolio <br/>  </li><p> As you determine which ETFs best meet your clients&rsquo; needs and objectives, bear in mind ETF liquidity and trading. This will help you better maximize opportunities and optimize trades at the best possible price in order to gain potentially higher total returns.</p><h3> <strong>  HOW FLEXSHARES CAN HELP </strong></h3><p> <br/> Our Capital Markets team offers expertise to help you trade in a cost-efficient manner.

This is not to say that all &lsquo;things&rsquo; founded in the US are appropriate to all of us, but in most cases, they are.</p><h3> Customer Experience &ndash; as a concept&hellip;. as an idea&hellip;. as a principle&hellip; as a profession&hellip; &ndash; it all started in the US.</h3><p> <br/> Now that is not actually true (he says quickly contradicting himself) &ndash; regular readers of my ramblings will now that I am always very quick to point out that all organisations since their inception have been delivering Customer Experiences &ndash; so technically, the first ever business to be created was the &lsquo;founder&rsquo; of Customer Experience&hellip;. without even knowing it!!!</p><p> However, it is true that most of the best examples &ndash; the earliest examples &ndash; of Customer Experience being deployed as a core element of business strategy was very much a US led phenomenon. Even now, some of the best examples of Customer Centric organisations are brought to life by US powerhouses of Customer Experience (CX).</p><p> <strong>  Amazon; Disney; Ritz Carlton; USAA &ndash; just to name but four &ndash; are all companies I talk about regularly as I travel around the globe. </strong> In 2015, I visited twenty countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East &ndash; on my travels I observed varying degrees of Customer Centricity. If I were to rate each part of the world from left to right, in my opinion, it is possible to see a difference in CX adoption &ndash; From high in the UK and Western Europe &ndash; lower in the Gulf region &ndash; lower still in Africa &ndash; rising a little in Asia &ndash; rising again as you reach Australia and New Zealand.</p><p> Obviously I am being extremely generic and vague in my personal observations &ndash; I do not want to upset entire continents!! Up until now, I have generally been of the opinion that the highest level of CX adoption is in North America. So when I confirmed that I would be travelling to Florida in January 2016, I immediately sensed an opportunity to put my personal theories to the test! Despite being a regular US visitor when I was a young boy (I have an American Mum &ndash; or Mom if you prefer), it is ten years since I last crossed the Atlantic Ocean. I was genuinely excited to see if it really is true &ndash; is the US &lsquo;better&rsquo; than the rest of the world when it comes to Customer Experience?</p><p> Before I tell you, please allow me to write a very quick disclaimer&hellip;.. I visited the US for three days &ndash; in one part of one state. My observations are based solely on this visit and as such, are NOT representative of the entire country! However, I very much specialise in &lsquo;flying visits&rsquo; to countries I visit, so my opinion is based in relative terms to the other countries I have visited in the last ten years.</p><p> The starting point for any trip to a country is likely to be the airport. It is not common to find courteous, friendly, smiling employees in one of those &ndash; especially when going through customs and immigration. In the last few months I have been grunted at, ignored, shouted at and in one case, asked for money by a Customs official (I kid you not). So my expectations are always pretty low at the start. <strong>  Would the US be any different? No&hellip;. is the simple answer. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ian-1.png\" width=\"630\"/></p><p> They have tried to make the experience more &lsquo;accessible&rsquo; &ndash; you complete most of the immigration process on self-service terminals &ndash; the only problem is that the terminals are not that intuitive. I spent five minutes arguing with the machine!!! It kept telling me that my left hand was my right hand and vice versa &ndash; it was very frustrating &ndash; and slight amusing to the casual observer. The problem is that there was not a member of staff in sight to help me. I battled for five minutes before finally an unsmiling; uncommunicative lady appeared and showed me what to do.</p><p> The immigration official and customs official I still had to interact with were no better &ndash; I was certainly not getting any sense of the &lsquo;have a nice day&rsquo; culture non US citizens tend to see as the stereotype. I was not too surprised though &ndash; airports are a slightly different kettle of fish to any other environment &ndash; would I see the real Customer Focused US on exit?</p><p> I could walk you through my trip step by step &ndash; but I am sure you do not want to hear about every detail. What I can confirm is that in my opinion, what I experienced in the US was NO DIFFERENT to the majority of countries I visit. It is not as bad as those who are yet to adopt CX in any meaningful way, but certainly no better than any other.</p><p> However, I did observe a key difference between the US and everyone else (in my opinion) &ndash; that difference being the likelihood of encountering the two EXTREMES of CX. <strong>  In three days, I experienced the very very bad, and the very very brilliant. I cannot remember being in the same situation anywhere else &ndash; ever. </strong></p><p> The reception staff in my hotel were dreadful &ndash; slow, rude, ineffective &ndash; very disappointing. Yet the waitress at breakfast &ndash; coincidentally called &lsquo;Angel&rsquo; &ndash; was AMAZING &ndash; a real credit to the hotel. The cabin crew on my American Airlines flight to Miami were&hellip;. Well let&rsquo;s just say there is not anything positive that springs to mind &ndash; apart from the fact that they probably fulfilled the tasks they were asked to.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ian-2.png\" width=\"479\"/></p><p> I can sometimes understand when my first name is mispronounced &ndash; especially in non native English speaking countries &ndash; however &ndash; on my US trip I was called &lsquo;Iron&rsquo; at least five times by different people &ndash; really! The &lsquo;piece de resistance&rsquo; though were the security officials back at the airport on my return. I genuinely have not encountered such rude human beings in an equivalent role as those at Miami International Airport &ndash; everyone (US local and  visitor alike) commented on how astonishingly bad there behaviour was!</p><p> As I boarded my American Airlines flight back to Heathrow, I was almost disappointed &ndash; disappointed that I had not really encountered a &lsquo;Ritz Carlton&rsquo; like &lsquo;Magic Moment&rsquo; to share in my blog. Most of my experiences were just the same as always &ndash; unmemorable. But like everything in life &ndash; sometimes things happen when you least expect it &ndash; and they did on my flight home.</p><p> I was greeted on the aircraft by a member of cabin crew &ndash; nothing unusual in that. But I was about to discover that the lady who greeted me &ndash; Jackie &ndash; and her colleague Tamela were exactly what I had been waiting for &ndash; the absolutely shining example of US Customer Focused BRILLIANCE.</p><p> What I found in these two ladies who were able to demonstrate the difference between just DOING YOUR JOB and doing your job whilst EMOTIONALLY ENGAGING with your customers. They performed exactly the same tasks as every other member of cabin crew I have encountered on more than 100 flights in the last 12 months alone. Yet Jackie and Tamela are to this date the only members of cabin crew I will remember by name &ndash; and I will never forget them.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"526\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ian-3.png\" width=\"567\"/></p><p> <strong>  I am writing this blog on an Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Dubai.  </strong> The cabin crew are very professional and courteous &ndash; yet their actions are so robotic, I almost do not feel like a human. What I saw with Jackie and Tamela were two people doing their job with humanity and enjoyment. They made me FEEL like a real person &ndash; they talked to me and smiled at me and went about their work with undeniable authenticity, honesty and sincerity. When I spoke to the &lsquo;purser&rsquo; to give her my feedback on them, she advised that &lsquo;many customers say that about them&rsquo;. Well I hope that many more have the fortune of encountering them in the future &ndash; they will make the most significant part American Airlines experience wonderfully memorable.

It pulls up a lot of emotional baggage and fear, and may shine a light on fundamental differences that the couple isn&rsquo;t aware of.</h3><p> <br/> Hard as this conversation is, the key is to a happy marriage is to address money issues long before a conflict, or financial crisis, emerges.</p><p> Here are three things you should know the money habits of your partner&mdash;before you marry:</p><h3> 1. When it comes to money, what is your future spouse&rsquo;s philosophy and values about earning, spending, and saving? </h3><p> <br/> For some, money may symbolize freedom, flexibility, or independence. For others, it may represent power, control, security, or love. It is not uncommon for your philosophy or values regarding money to differ from the person you&rsquo;re engaged to. After all, you both have your own individual life experiences that ultimately influence your money personality. What&rsquo;s important is to have an open, honest conversation about your thoughts, beliefs, and financial goals. That will save you from a lot of heartache down the road.</p><h3> 2. Know each other&rsquo;s saving and spending habits. </h3><p> <br/> As Tom Jones serenades in the disco classic,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/tom%2Bjones/love%2Bis%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bair_20249331.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Love Is In The Air:  </a> </u> &ldquo; Love is in the air everywhere I look around, Love is in the air every sight and every sound; I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m being foolish, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m being wise, But it&rsquo;s something that I must believe in, And it&rsquo;s there when I look in your eyes.&rdquo; Sweet, right? Now, wake up. There&rsquo;s nothing sentimental about money. If your honey loves to splurge on a weekly purchase of flowers, champagne, and caviar, and you prefer to show your love with a pepperoni pizza and save the rest of your hard-earned cash for a rainy day, your relationship will flounder when the bank statement arrives. To avoid the drama:</p><li> <strong>  Make time to learn each other&rsquo;s saving and spending habits. </strong> Find out if your betrothed lives paycheck to paycheck, or sticks to a budget.</li><li> <strong>  Know whether your future spouse is spender or a saver. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Decide how much you will annually contribute to your 401(k) at work or systematically direct your savings to an IRA or an emergency fund. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Address each other&rsquo;s debt obligations before you say, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and that adage most definitely holds true when addressing each other&rsquo;s debt obligations. Don&rsquo;t wait until you officially exchange your wedding vows to discuss how you will handle any current and future personal debt (student loans, credit card debt, business loans, car notes). The reality is that debt brought into a marriage may cause additional pressure. Be clear, have a payment plan, and establish long- and short-term financial goals before you walk down the aisle.</p><h3> The Bottom Line</h3><p> <br/> Couples often make the mistake of focusing so much on the bliss of getting married and planning the perfect wedding that they avoid the hard discussion of money. Don&rsquo;t make that mistake. By investing time and energy in your future financial plans and goals early on, you&rsquo;ll be preparing for a truly happy marriage. In the end, isn&rsquo;t that the real goal?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-25 17:05:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-25 17:05:13.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_3eOqRol.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-you-should-know-about-your-future-spouses-finances/\", \"post_id\": \"8818\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-25 17:05:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-25 17:05:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-you-should-know-about-your-future-spouses-finances\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8817\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4187\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/What-You-Should-Know-About-Your-Future-Spouses-Finances.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"740\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453820400,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4034,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A New Breed of Smart Client Has Emerged — Are You Ready?","link":"a-new-breed-of-smart-client-has-emerged-are-you-ready","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One of the key themes across numerous 2016 predictions articles and reports since December last year is how clients have become more savvy and demanding - be that private or commercial clients.</h3>As the 2015 <u> <a href=\"https://www.lexisnexis-es.co.uk/assets/files/LexisNexis_Bellwether2015_Age_of_the_Client.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  LexisNexis&rsquo; Bellwether Report </a></u> noted &ldquo;A new breed of smart client has emerged &ndash; empowered by technology and the internet, always searching for the best value, and very much aware of their own importance as customers.&rdquo;  In wealth management PWC has observed that &ldquo;understanding the client&rsquo;s perspective of value is only getting tougher.&rdquo;Yet remarkably few firms still have a formal client insight or client experience programme to speak of beyond basic satisfaction surveys (in which advisers and fee earners inevitably score highly) or the occasional stab at net promotor scoring.  Good quality insight requires a variety of quantitative and qualitative techniques across the client journey.For those considering doing more in this area I would flag a number of reasons why a greater investment in insight and client experience will more than pay for itself.<h3> <strong>  1. YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION AND CLIENT ACQUISITION </strong></h3>A clear articulation of your firm&rsquo;s proposition that distinguishes and differentiates you is the key to engaging clients and introducers.  But your firm&rsquo;s story needs to be considered through the eyes of all your key stakeholders. Examining what current clients value, why new clients bought, and why they leave is crucial in honing your efforts to reduce wasted resources and to accelerate the acquisition of new clients.<h3> <strong>  2. RETENTION, REFERRAL AND REPEAT BUSINESS (SHARE OF WALLET) </strong></h3>Feedback programmes generate loyalty and trust.  Asking clients for feedback and showing that you have acted on it demonstrates the importance of your clients to your business in a tangible way &ndash; making them feel like valued insiders and supporting your trusted adviser status.  People who trust your firm will refer you work.Feedback programmes provide an opportunity to tell /remind clients of everything you do or could do for them - increasing their perception of the value of what you do for them and potentially opening up further/additional conversations leading to uncovering additional needs for your services.Considering your introducer network also, working collaboratively to meet client needs is essential &ndash; whether cross border and/or advice discipline &ndash; and working with other advisers that you know and trust is key.  Yet it is common for advisers in one professional discipline to be unclear about how other professions attract, retain and serve clients, and what their own business challenges and risks are. Introducing more formalised insight and feedback into your relationship with other advisers can help you meet their needs more effectively, making you easier to do business with and facilitating referrals and recommendations.<h3> <strong>  3. CREATE AND DEMONSTRATE A STRONG CONDUCT RISK CULTURE </strong></h3>Treating customers fairly and conduct risk are high on management agendas and running a firm that produces good outcomes for clients is simply good business sense.  Showing how you do it, who you do it for and how you can prove it works is where many firms struggle.  Structured consumer feedback supports this.The FCA kick-started a debate in June 2015 to encourage firms, consumer groups, and stakeholders to work together to deliver information to consumers in smarter and more effective ways and talking to customers and clients will be key to success in this area.Even for firms who do not sell direct to the consumer, problems inherent in longer distribution chains and complexity in the investment market creates an onus on firms to ensure the end client understands what is on offer. Reviewing communications and product development in conjunction with your clients and your clients&rsquo; clients will ensure you are not only addressing the regulator&rsquo;s concerns effectively, but are seen to be doing so &ndash; by all your stakeholders.<h3> <strong>  4. IMPROVE CLIENT EXPERIENCE </strong></h3>&ldquo;Everybody wants to own the client nobody wants to own the client experience,&rdquo; as the saying goes.In many professional firms there can be a disconnect between the front office/fee earners and support departments.  In addition as more and more communication and transactions become digital (still primarily email) there is an increasing disconnect between the front office/fee earners and their clients as well.Keeping everyone in a business focused on the client and ensuring clients know they are central to your business needs to be demonstrated to all stakeholders.Formal client feedback can be used to share best practice internally, and to align staff across organisations that may be culturally or geographically diverse or dispersed.<h3> <strong>  5. ENGAGE AND RETAIN THE NEXT GENERATION </strong></h3>For wealth managers and private client firms there is a growing concern that a culture of shopping around and a generation who do not necessarily see their ambitions, tastes, or demographic make-up reflected in their parents&rsquo; advisers will encourage them to make alternative arrangements when they inherit their parents&rsquo; wealth.Involving the next generation early in debate and discussion on their needs and issues can help firms show the whole family how they work and will give valuable insights into how firms can evolve to better meet the needs of younger clients.<h3> <strong>  6. GUIDE DIGITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS </strong></h3>As firms invest in technology to improve the client experience, deciding what to invest in should be driven to some degree by what clients will value most and research may uncover ways to make relatively simple, straight-forward enhancements to the client experience that have value for clients.<h3> <strong>  7. GIVE YOUR BRAND A USP AND RAISE YOUR PROFILE </strong></h3>Financial and professional services firms find it difficult to build a brand that sets them apart from their peers and attracts clients and business partners to them.  Being seen to have continuing, regular, open and honest dialogue with clients, and acting on what they say gives a tangible edge to a trusted adviser brand &ndash; trust goes two ways and firms that do not talk to clients regularly will increasingly lack credibility and appeal.<h3> <strong>  8. INCREASE THE VALUE OF YOUR BUSINESS </strong></h3>An engaged, secure client base with a high share of wallet/repeat business rate, low cost new business pipelines via a robust referral network, and a brand that is known, liked and trusted will make your business significantly more valuable.Your clients are your business and your business is valued more if it is stable, growing, predictable, robust and repeatable. Impress your clients and they will find you new ones, make a habit of impressing them and you&rsquo;ll be able to prove your income is building year on year. Your priority is to know what will impress your clients most, deliver it, and ask again.<strong> &ldquo;What do customers want? Don't guess: Ask them.

{"original_id":4035,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Surefire Ways To Move Through Uncertainty","link":"4-surefire-ways-to-move-through-uncertainty","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The FBI requires all agents to qualify with their firearm at least four times a year. Part of this training is taking turns arresting fellow agents and putting them in handcuffs.</h3><p> <br/> As I tried to handcuff one of the senior agents on my squad, I found he didn&rsquo;t have the flexibility to place the back of his hands together behind his back. Over time, he had lost a great deal of the suppleness in his shoulder muscles.</p><p> While he took great deal of ribbing by fellow agents, I remember thinking: &ldquo;If only he&rsquo;d made the effort to keep limber, he would have more flexibility.&rdquo;</p><p> If stretching and yoga can promote healthier bodies, we need to find similar ways to keep our mind flexible and agile for top performance. Rigid thinking cannot help us adapt when we are faced with the uncertainty of today&rsquo;s workplace.</p><p> As entrepreneurs, leaders, and business owners, you are required to adapt and move through transitions at faster and faster paces. Whether it is a new assignment, a new supervisor, or a new career&mdash;success depends on finding new ways to keep our minds supple.</p><p> Mental toughness is the ability to be flexible and agile in the way we respond when faced with the uncertainties of both life and work.</p><p> Here are 4 surefire ways you can develop the mindset to move through uncertainty:</p><h3> 1. Overcome Uncertainty By Growing A Little Each Day</h3><p> <br/> When facing uncertainty, you have two choices:</p><p> You can dread it because you are afraid of failing&mdash;you believe that failure sends a negative message about your abilities, or&hellip;</p><p> You can anticipate it because you interpret failure as an opportunity for learning and improvement.</p><p> The first choice describes a fixed mindset that does best when there is a heavy hand running the show. That way of leading may have been efficient years ago, but today&rsquo;s leaders are learning that the brain power of their workforce is a terrible thing to waste.</p><p> The second choice describes a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   growth mindset  </a> </u>  that looks at success as hard work, learning, training, and having the grit to keep moving ahead even when faced with obstacles and roadblocks.</p><h3> 2. Overcome Uncertainty By Discovering What Makes You Feel Strong</h3><p> <br/> As an FBI agent, one of the first things I did was surveil the target of my investigation. I analyzed and assessed their strengths, weaknesses, needs, and wants. This gave me tremendous power, because I usually came to know more about them than they knew about themselves.</p><p> Harness that same power by making yourself the target of your own investigation:</p><p> <strong>  a. Discover your own patterns: </strong> What makes you smile? What are you always wanting to do or think about? What can you not help do, think, or feel? Even if someone asks you not to?</p><p> <strong>  b. Keep track of how you spend the next week: </strong> What are you doing, feeling or thinking about daily? Write down everything that energizes you and makes you feel strong. It could be a particular physical activity, or a book you read, or people you meet. Alongside, write down everything that makes you feel less confident or anxious. How many of these do you encounter at work?</p><p> <strong>  c. Compare the lists: </strong> How can you start doing more of the things that make you feel strong? And eliminate those that make you feel threatened?</p><p> When you find a few things you repeatedly do and love, dig deeper and see what part of that particular activity makes you feel good&mdash;and empowers you.</p><p> As you transition out of your current situation or move into a time of uncertainty, lean into those things that make you feel strong and keep a wary eye out for those things that do not empower you.</p><h3> 3. Overcome Uncertainty By Mixing It Up</h3><p> <br/> FBI training is relentless and continuous, but this kept our minds flexible and agile so we could adapt to the unknown when confronting an arrest situation.</p><p> When a roadblock or obstacle confronts us, we often have no Plan B. Instead of moving around a roadblock in a deliberate and flexible manner, we continue to assault it using the same tactics that have already proven ineffective. Our default explanation is blaming others.</p><p> The only thing worse than getting into a rut is staying in one. Often, our patterns of thinking become rigid because we&rsquo;re fixated on thinking about achieving our life&rsquo;s goals in one way.</p><p> Mix up the way you think. It&rsquo;s important to combine focused thought with periods of play and scattered attention because changes in your environment, attitude, and behavior influences how you think.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re feeling happy or optimistic, you are more inclusive and more creative. When you are fearful, your focus narrows down to specific details.</p><p> Mental toughness is having the flexibility to make a mental shift without remaining stuck in a particular mindset.</p><h3> 4. Overcome Uncertainty By Summoning The Courage To Try New Things</h3><p> <br/> Finding our courage is no small thing, but once we find it, it takes over everything in its path. A flood of courage is exactly what we need when faced with uncertainty.</p><p> The goal is to move fluidly between specific and abstract thought patterns so you can flex and bend with the changing circumstances of your life. Start with making small changes in your routine. Taking the stairs instead of the elevator or listening to different music can boost your mental agility.</p><p> Variety is also good. Try different foods and different methods of exercise. Call a friend and go to a place you&rsquo;ve never visited. Watch your thoughts become more expansive as you break out of old patterns and develop your brain.</p><p> A flexible and agile mindset is essential if you plan to get past the roadblocks and obstacles ahead of you. Remember this: everyone can get smarter about how to overcome obstacles if they work at it.</p><p> How have you pushed through periods of uncertainty?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 16:17:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 16:17:13.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_IO2PMMC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-surefire-ways-to-move-through-uncertainty/\", \"post_id\": \"8822\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 16:17:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 16:17:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-surefire-ways-to-move-through-uncertainty\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8823\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4190\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Surefire-Ways-To-Move-Through-Uncertainty.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"606\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453914000,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

You re-play miscommunications in your head.</p><p> And just like elite athletes, you need a conversational game plan.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kPyj3muEweI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-8.24.00-AM.png\" width=\"849\"/> </a> click to view</p><p> The art of sparkling conversation is one of our most requested topics at the Science of People. So a few months ago, I decided to do a bit of research on the topic to write this post for you. One thing I did was begin to ask people when they have had bad conversations in addition to good ones. And I noticed a pattern&mdash;most of the bad conversations had a very specific sequence of events leading up to the actual awkward moment. Here&rsquo;s what we heard over and over again:</p><li> I signed up for this networking event a few weeks before and had no idea who was going or what the organization was all about, but a friend of a friend recommended it.</li><li> On the way over, I caught up on a few calls and checked my email before walking in.</li><li> My calendar said 5pm start time, so I showed up at 5:30pm hoping I would be fashionably late&mdash;and that they wouldn&rsquo;t have a programming starting right at 5pm or run out of drinks!</li><li> Once I got inside, I noticed the event was much larger (or smaller) than I anticipated and, oops, someone was presenting up front. I tried to get my nametag and sign in as quietly as possible.</li><li> I missed most of what the speaker said, but when she finally finished up people around me began to rekindle conversations and talk about what was said.</li><li> I tried to start to talk to a few groups around me, but either remained passively on the outside or had a bland start and stop back and forth.</li><li> Most of the night was awkward and not helpful&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t make any useful connections. <br/>  </li><h3> I want to stop this pattern! How can you make dazzling conversation with anyone you meet?</h3><p> <br/> How can you get business and connections and dates out of your meetings? I want to show you that there is both an art and a science to effective communication.</p><p> I have broken down the structure of a conversation into 10 steps that will take your average interactions and make them awesome ones.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s do it:</p><h3> <strong>  The Step-By-Step Guide to Awesome Conversations: </strong> <br/>  </h3><br /><h3> Step #1: Intention</h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest conversational mistakes is going into your events, dates, meetings and parties directionless. You would never start driving to a new destination without the address. And you certainly would try to look at a map or get directions if you were going to a new place. The same applies for conversations.</p><p> A conversation without a game plan is like driving without a map.</p><p> Like any good athlete, conversationalists practice, prepare and execute with the intention to win. While you don&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;win&rsquo; a conversation, you might want to win business, win friends or win new ideas. Before any social interaction, set your intention, know your crowd and do your research. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything major, but rather simple one sentence answers to the following: Who, What, When, Why.</p><li> <strong>  Who: </strong> Who is hosting the event?</li><li> <strong>  What: </strong> What kinds of people are going?</li><li> <strong>  When: </strong> When is it and what&rsquo;s the schedule?</li><li> <strong>  Why: </strong> Why are you going? <br/>  </li><p> Even a simple, &ldquo;I want to find some new clients&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to have a great time&rdquo; sets up an intention that means you are more likely to have purpose while speaking to people. Purpose provides confidence, boosts influence and is contagious. As humans, we like someone with direction.</p><h3> Step #2: Approach</h3><p> <br/> We make our first impression in the first 7 seconds of seeing someone&mdash;this happens sometimes before you even start talking. Most people think that we don&rsquo;t make our first impression until we start talking, but this is not the case. Be sure that before you even start the conversation, you are approaching it with open and confident body language. When we first see someone, our brain is trying to gauge if they are friend or foe. You want to signal &lsquo;friend&rsquo; signals right off the bat. Here&rsquo;s how to have open body language right when you walk in the door:</p><li> <strong>  Keep your hands visible </strong></li><li> <strong>  Roll your shoulders down and back so they are nice and relaxed </strong></li><li> <strong>  Smile when you see someone you recognize or you want to talk to </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Step #3: Openers</h3><p> <br/> What is the best conversation opener you have ever heard?</p><p> What is your go-to conversation starter?</p><p> The hardest part of a conversation is the opener. We tend to agonize over who and how to approach someone for a conversation. But don&rsquo;t worry! A few conversation starters are the easiest way to get the chit chat ball rolling.</p><li> <strong>  First, </strong> research has found that the most effective conversation starter is a simple, &ldquo;Hello, how are you?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s super easy, but it works!</li><li> <strong>  Second, </strong> you can always use context to help. Ask how the wine is or comment on the venue or event. These are extremely subtle and make it easy to strike up conversation. <br/>  </li><h3> Step #4: Sparks</h3><p> Once you have the conversation started you want to keep it going. The most charismatic people look for conversation sparks. They bring up topics, look for ideas and ask questions that spark energy or get the person excited. If you orient your questions and intention around eliciting sparks, it will be much easier to keep the conversation going and avoid awkward lulls or directionless chit chat. I have a list of my favorite  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2013/10/helpful-conversation-starters/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   33 Conversation Starters  </a> </u>  but here are three you can try right now:</p><li> Have any big vacation plans coming up?</li><li> Tried any new restaurants lately?</li><li> Working on any personal passion projects at the moment? <br/>  </li><h3> Step #5: Eyebrows</h3><p> <br/> I want to teach you one of the easiest and most fun nonverbal conversation tricks. The eyebrow raise. Across cultures, the eyebrow raise is what we do when we hear or see something interesting. When you see someone do it in conversation it often means you have said something engaging or brought up a topic that peaks their curiosity. The eyebrow raise is the physical indicator of a spark. It clues you in to a topic that they might like discussing.</p><p> I had a great example of the eyebrow raise happen to me the other day. I was sharing a story at a networking event with a marketing executive. I was telling him about a great commercial I saw while watching a Portland Timbers game (the Portland soccer team). He was nodding along while I talked about the commercial, but when I mentioned it was during a Timbers game, his eyebrows did a nice jump. After I finished the story, I asked him if he was a soccer fan. Sure enough, he said his son was trying out to go pro&mdash;and this started a great conversation about soccer, sports and kids. We traded cards and I hope to do a workshop for his marketing team.</p><h3> Step #6: Captivate</h3><p> <br/> I listen to a A LOT of podcasts. One of my favorites is the Tim Ferriss podcast. He interviews the most fascinating people and asks really interesting deep diving questions. On one of his  <u>  <a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/10/20/the-athlete-and-artist-who-cheats-death-jimmy-chin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   podcasts with Jimmy Chin  </a> </u> , a professional climber, Jimmy was talking about advice he would give to first time climbers. This was interesting, but then he started telling a story to back up his advice about one of his first climbs. As soon as he started the story I was sucked into it. I leaned in, gasped at the surprises and held my breath for the ending. Not only did the story mentally capture me, I also felt a physiological response while he told it. I will remember his advice far more from the story than from his tips even though the story was not as direct.</p><li> <strong>  What are your favorite stories to tell? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What is a story you can tell to back up a claim? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How can you answer in anecdotes? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Warning: Stories are great, but don&rsquo;t be a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/11/how-to-spot-a-toxic-person/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   conversational narcissist  </a> </u> &mdash;make sure you do equal talking and listening by asking for their stories as well.</p><h3> Step #7: Reciprocity</h3><p> <br/> No matter how great your body language is or how many funny stories you tell, if you commit a conversational sin you will turn people off. The biggest deal breaker is &lsquo;Conversational Mooching.&rsquo; You know when you ask someone a question and they answer, but don&rsquo;t ask you back? Like you ask them where they are from and they say &ldquo;New York&rdquo;.. and then silence. We expect reciprocity in conversations. When we share something, we want someone else to share something. When we ask a question we want them to answer and ask us back. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be tit for tat, but we are coded to look for and be treated with equality. Be sure you are not a moocher and give back as much as you get.</p><li> <strong>  Note: One other conversational sin is being a one-upper. </strong> A one-upper is someone who constantly has to outdo you or your story. You had a bad day&mdash;well they had an even worse one! You traveled to 20 countries&mdash;well they traveled to 25 AND have done all 50 states! Let people enjoy their moment and celebrate with them, don&rsquo;t one-up them. <br/>  </li><h3> Step #8: Bookmarking</h3><p> <br/> Some of the most talented conversationalists do something called &lsquo;Bookmarking&rsquo; during conversations. This is an advanced technique that I love, but it does take some practice. The bookmarking technique is when you add markers or emphasis to a certain part of the conversation that can create a deeper connection. Bookmarks are verbal markers you say to make it easier to follow-up or have something to talk about in the future. Here are the different types:</p><li> <strong>  Future Mentions: </strong>  Let&rsquo;s say you are talking about conferences and someone mentions they are going to the same one as you in a few months. If you like the person, you can &lsquo;bookmark&rsquo; it by saying something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m headed there as well, we should get coffee after one of the sessions.&rdquo; This is a bookmark that you can follow up on later.</li><li> <strong>  Inside Jokes: </strong>  These are my favorite&mdash;they are very rare but are lovely when they happen. Let&rsquo;s say you are chatting with someone and something interesting or funny happens. You can create a bookmark and then mention it to repeat the laugh again later. I also call this &lsquo;Milking the Joke.&rsquo; For example, I was on a long cross country flight where they gave everyone a little bowl of nuts before take-off. For some reason they put the bowl down in front of us and then took them away not even a minute later because they had to &lsquo;clean-up.&rsquo; I literally had time to eat one nut out of the whole bowl. So when they took it away, I turned to the guy next to me and said, &ldquo;Budget cuts and recycling are really killing the experience.&rdquo; And he laughed and I laughed and we struck up a conversation. During dinner, we both made a joke about having to eat fast in case they took it away. Whenever they served us coffee we giggled about hiding the mug just in case they had to &lsquo;clean it up.&rsquo; I gave him my card and he followed up with an email with the subject: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take my nuts!&rdquo; and said I should give him a call next time I was in Dallas for a free dinner at the steakhouse he owned&mdash;free steak! I credit milking the joke for this free meal.</li><li> <strong>  Same Same:  </strong> Sometimes you can verbalize a &lsquo;same-same&rsquo; moment. A same-same moment is when you both find out you have a similar interest, background or commonality. You bookmark it by exclaiming how crazy it is you have that in common. For example, I met a woman at a party and it came out that we both are the eldest of three sisters and have a 12 year age span between us. I bookmarked it by exclaiming, &ldquo;WOW! I don&rsquo;t think I have ever met someone with the same family situation as me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to Facebook you next time one my sisters asks me to get her out of trouble, because you might be the only person in the world who gets it.&rdquo; She agreed and we shared multiple stories of this occurring. We became Facebook friends and sure enough, she sent me a screenshot of a text from her sister requesting a ride.</li><li> <strong>  You Have to See:  </strong> Sometimes you can bookmark with a follow-up mention. I often bring up books, videos or articles I like to people while speaking to them. If they give me an eyebrow raise and seem interested I will bookmark it by saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to Tweet you the link so you can check it out!&rdquo; I love doing this because I get to share something I like and they will often send recommendations back to me. <br/>  </li><h3> Step #9: Exits</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;ve started a conversation, sparked stories and gotten to know each other&mdash;now you have to end it. Sometimes the art of the last impression is just as hard as nailing the first impression. The art of ending a conversation is easy. I have an entire post on the art of a  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/06/how-to-make-a-graceful-exit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  graceful exit </a> , but I encourage you to use bookmarks to end well.</p><li> <strong>  Future Mentions:  </strong> &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t wait to see you at that ___ coming up&mdash;I&rsquo;ll email you!&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Inside Jokes: </strong>  &ldquo;It was great laughing with you. I&rsquo;ll be sure to ___ in the future ;)&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Same Same: </strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I met a fellow ___ fan. You made my night!&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  You Have to See: </strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to send that link your way, great talking to you!&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> Step #10: The Post-Mortem</h3><p> <br/> I know after an event or date you can be tired and all you want to do is flip on some Netflix and call it a night. But, take a few minutes to do a post-mortem. This can be in your head as you drive home, talking with a spouse or roommate or writing in a journal. Answer the following three questions:</p><li> <strong>  What went well tonight? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What did I learn? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Who should I follow-up with? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The art of conversation is a skill&mdash;you have to keep learning and honing your ability. Your post-mortems can help you identify patterns and remember to follow up on bookmarks, LinkedIn connections and promises.</p><p> <strong>  Tell me what&rsquo;s your favorite conversation trick? </strong></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 16:29:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 16:29:21.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_T9zAfwC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-steps-to-the-perfect-conversation/\", \"post_id\": \"8826\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 16:29:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 16:29:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-steps-to-the-perfect-conversation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8824\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4191\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10-Steps-to-the-Perfect-Conversation.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"790\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453901400,"author_id":498,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4037,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Small Client Problem: A Comprehensive Guide to Solving This Tough Issue","link":"the-small-client-problem-a-comprehensive-guide-to-solving-this-tough-issue","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Every firm has small clients. Some have thousands of them. Are they a waste of time? Or, potentially, a valuable source of future growth?</h3><p> <br/> Nearly 30 years ago, at my old consulting firm, we had a big debate about small projects. Some partners argued that they were an entry point to a bigger relationship, and that from acorns, oaks would grow. Others maintained that they had low margins, took up valuable time and resources that could be better spent elsewhere, and would not lead to bigger and better things.</p><p> So, we analyzed all the small projects we had done over the previous three years. And guess what? We found that all those small projects either led nowhere or they led to more small projects. Exactly why, however, was less clear. Were we choosing the wrong clients to begin with? Were we lousy at turning a foot in the door into a long-term relationship? Did a small, initial project position us as a firm that did small things, and therefore that&rsquo;s what clients felt comfortable giving us?  Were these particular clients inherently reluctant to use outside advisors except in truly extenuating circumstances?</p><p> In fact, my story does not make a case against doing small engagements. Rather, it highlights how vexing&mdash;and complex&mdash;the issue really is. The dynamics and options are different, for example, when we&rsquo;re talking about a small project done for a small client versus one done for a large, well-known company.</p><p> And, keep in mind that there&rsquo;s a structural element to having small clients. It&rsquo;s very difficult to create a portfolio of only large clients who use you for your full range of services. Yet, saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to every opportunity isn&rsquo;t really a strategy. I had a client, a law firm, that was asked to help with a piece of litigation. It would have represented millions in fees. But because they had a small client in the same industry that was paying them a meager $50,000 a year, they were conflicted out and couldn&rsquo;t take the work.</p><h3> Most firms do find that many of their small clients are a drain.</h3><p> <br/> Their sales costs to get the business are high relative to the revenue they get, there is no leverage or scale, and they take time away from more attractive opportunities.</p><p> On the other hand, can you afford to dump all your small relationships? In many firms, these provide 30% or 40% of revenues.</p><p> By establishing clear criteria for accepting small engagements to begin with, and using some proven strategies for managing your existing ones, you can do a much better job of handling this problem. Let&rsquo;s look at how to do this.</p><h3> When to Accept a Small Project</h3><p> <br/> There are plenty of good reasons to take on a small project. Here are eight:</p><p> <strong>  1. It is a marquis name. </strong>  Will working for this company, by dint of its market reputation and renown, cast a positive light on your own firm?</p><p> <strong>  2. The client is large enough to eventually support a substantial relationship. </strong>  Even if the first project or transaction is small, is there potential to grow and expand the account?</p><p> <strong>  3. The project will fuel your innovation and intellectual capital development. </strong>  Are there aspects to the engagement that are leading-edge or in a new area that will help strengthen your service and product breadth?</p><p> <strong>  4. It will have high profit margins. </strong>  Will it be highly profitable for you? Or will you lose all of your margin in overruns and high sales costs?</p><p> <strong>  5. The relationship will help develop your younger staff.  </strong> Would this be a good developmental experience for your professionals?</p><p> <strong>  6. The project is at the c-suite level and focused on a mission-critical issue. </strong>  Is this work strategic for the client? If so, even though very small, it may be valuable to undertake.</p><p> <strong>  7. It&rsquo;s a small but high-growth company. </strong>  Could this client become a real contender in its industry?</p><p> <strong>  8. The client doesn&rsquo;t trust you and a small project would be a confidence-building measure. </strong>  Perhaps the client had a bad experience with you or your firm in the past. Or perhaps they are satisfied with their existing providers, and will only try you for something modest and low risk.</p><h3> When to Reject a Small Engagement</h3><p> <br/> There are many potential reasons to say no&mdash;for example:</p><p> <strong>  1. You will be working for a very junior manager. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. The work will position you incorrectly with the client and in the marketplace. </strong></p><p> <strong>  3. The work is not in your sweet spot. </strong></p><p> <strong>  4. The problem you&rsquo;re addressing is not a high priority for the company. </strong></p><p> <strong>  5. Having the company as a client would create a conflict and render you unable to take a much better opportunity in the future with a larger competitor. </strong></p><p> <strong>  6. The project will take up too much time and be a distraction from investing in more attractive opportunities. </strong></p><p> <strong>  7. The client is small and unused to using a firm like yours, and it will always feel to them like you&rsquo;re very expensive. </strong></p><p> <strong>  8. There is no truly compelling reason to take it, such as one of the seven outlined above. </strong></p><p> Everyone hates to say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; especially to a revenue opportunity. But that&rsquo;s the essence of strategy&mdash;saying yes to the right opportunities and no to the wrong ones.</p><h3> What to Do With Your Current Small Clients</h3><p> <br/> You need to do a thorough analysis of your small clients, and determine which of the following six strategies makes the most sense:</p><p> <strong>  1. Renegotiate your pricing.  </strong> Implement a price increase, and see what happens. If the client leaves, it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be. If they stay and become a profitable, financially attractive client, then you may be a lot happier with the situation.</p><p> <strong>  2. Reduce your cost of servicing the account. </strong>  It may be that you can design a business model to service smaller clients more economically and therefore raise their attractiveness. Some firms have actually made this their strategy, and profitably targeted the small companies that large providers don&rsquo;t want or can&rsquo;t manage effectively.</p><p> <strong>  3. Have someone who is younger or less experienced manage the relationship. </strong>  It may even be a good experience for them.</p><p> <strong>  4. Renegotiate the relationship.  </strong> If the client is small, this may not be possible. But if it is a larger company, management may be open to discussing a broader, higher-impact relationship with your company.</p><p> <strong>  5. Drop them. </strong>  Try to leave on good terms. Explain that your strategy no longer allows you to work with smaller clients. Recommend someone who can do a good job for them.</p><p> <strong>  6. Keep them. </strong> If the relationship is highly profitable or perhaps provides other benefits to you&mdash;such as community relationships, the ability to help a nonprofit cause, or connections to other high-value prospects&mdash;you may be happy keeping them on as a client. But many of your small clients will probably need to be managed using strategies 1-5, above.</p><h3> In the end, managing small clients is a change management issue as well as a strategic conundrum.</h3><p> <br/> Never underestimate the resistance to saying goodbye to a client&mdash;sometimes people have the best personal relationships with their smallest accounts. This means you need to win your front-line professionals over to your approach, and carefully follow up to ensure the right actions are being taken.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 16:36:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 16:36:22.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_hURF5rh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-small-client-problem-a-comprehensive-guide-to-solving-this-tough-issue/\", \"post_id\": \"8828\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 16:36:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 16:36:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-small-client-problem-a-comprehensive-guide-to-solving-this-tough-issue\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8827\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4192\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Small-Client-Problem-A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Solving-This-Tough-Issue.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"633\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453957200,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;ll give you five reasons why you&rsquo;ll want to be out there selling to existing customers.</p><h3> 1. They have a far higher chance of actually closing.</h3><p> <br/> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickhull/2013/12/06/tools-for-entrepreneurs-to-retain-clients/\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketing Metrics  </a> </u> , &ldquo;businesses have a 60 to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5% to 20%.&rdquo;</p><p> Personally, I think that&rsquo;s a little pessimistic. I&rsquo;m sure the real closing rate for most firms on new business is a little higher &ndash; but the argument still stands.</p><p> New clients already know you, and your work (which is top-notch, right?). They&rsquo;ll have already benefited from the value you deliver, meaning there&rsquo;s less uncertainty in working with you. And you probably already  <u>  identified several new ways in which you might be able to help them meet their business objectives </u> .</p><p> Meaning they&rsquo;re that much more likely to close.</p><h3> 2. They are likely to spend more.</h3><p> <br/> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/6-rules-for-building-a-customer-first-company.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data from Laura Lake  </a> </u> , existing customers spend roughly 33% more than compared to new customers. Think about it this way: every sale you make to an existing customer could increase revenue by 30% &ndash; for the same number of deals actually closed, one third more revenue.</p><p> So now we&rsquo;re two for two: not only are existing customers far more likely to close, but they actually spend more on each transaction as well.</p><h3> 3. They close much faster.</h3><p> <br/> Data from Accenture has shown that  <u>  close to 50% of all business with existing customers closes within 3 months </u>  &ndash; the space of a single quarter. With new clients, the number of opportunities that close within that same 3-month timeframe drops down to 20%.</p><p> In other words, you could be closing more than double the amount of new business within the next three months by simply shifting your focus from selling to new customers to selling to existing customers.</p><h3> 4. They help increase profits.</h3><p> <br/> Given what I&rsquo;ve said thus far, it shouldn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise that selling to existing clients helps increase profits &ndash; but by just how much?</p><p> According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/7/18/customer_retention.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   joint study by Bain and Harvard Business School  </a> </u> , &ldquo;(we) showed that in industry after industry, the high cost of acquiring customers renders many customer relationships unprofitable during their early years. Only in later years, when the cost of serving loyal customers falls and the volume of their purchases rises, do relationships generate big returns. The bottom line: Increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, given the acquisition costs for new customers, selling to existing customer is a tremendously powerful lever for boosting profits &ndash; even with relatively small increases in retention rates.</p><h3> 5. They help reduce costs.</h3><p> <br/> If there&rsquo;s talk of increasing profits, reducing costs typically isn&rsquo;t far behind. Salesforce estimates that it is  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/08/customer-service-stats.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   6&ndash;7 times more costly to attract new customers than it is to retain an existing customer  </a> </u> .</p><p> Many organisations suffer from low retention rates, hampering their ability to gain all of the significant benefits outlined above. By selling to existing customers versus new ones, they could simultaneously reduce costs and increase profits.</p><p> Perhaps more importantly for their salesforce, they could increase close rates (dramatically), increase the average spend and more than double the number of sales closing within the space of a quarter.</p><p> Yet, all this depends on a key underlying premise: your (organisation&rsquo;s) ability to keep current clients happy, demonstrate value, build trust and &ndash; perhaps most importantly &ndash; identify future opportunities where you might be able to help them.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 16:40:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 16:40:54.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_zngHBlA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-need-to-get-better-at-selling-to-existing-customers/\", \"post_id\": \"8830\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 16:40:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 16:40:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-need-to-get-better-at-selling-to-existing-customers\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8829\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4193\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-You-Need-To-Get-Better-At-Selling-To-Existing-Customers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"482\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453927800,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4039,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Reasons to Use Long-Form Content","link":"8-reasons-to-use-long-form-content","source_link":null,"content":"The fact that you&rsquo;re reading this blog right now is proof that long-form content is not just for magazine subscribers and book readers. Though the Internet is characterized by a bombardment of messages, fast-loading pages and frenetic click-throughs, there is still a rightful place for longer pieces of content spanning 1,500 words or more.Long-form articles, blogs, whitepapers, eBooks and newsletters promise readers everything they need to know on a given topic all in one convenient place. Anyone can spew out a piddly 400 words of generalized garbage, but it takes a more skilled writer with a love for research and a better understanding of the topic to churn out thousands of words on a given subject.Of course, paying someone to spend the time and energy writing a really, really, really long piece of content naturally costs more. You may be wondering: &ldquo;Is it truly worth the added expense for just one piece of content, when you could feasibly be paying the writer for several smaller pieces?&rdquo; The answer is very much a personal decision that depends on several factors. Here are eight reasons why long-form content may be a worthwhile investment for you in the coming year.<h3> 8 Reasons to Use Long-Form Content</h3><h3> 1. Rank better in the search engines.</h3>Want to get ranked in the top 10 search results? The answer could be long-form content, according to a much-cited <u> 2012 study by serpIQ</u>, which found that the average content length of top 10 posts was 2,000 words or more. The #1 ranking article contained an average of 2,416 words, in fact!Check out the word counts on serpIQ&rsquo;s study of top 10 search engine results:<img alt=\"Average Content Length\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Average-Content-Length.jpg\"/>Image Source: <u> <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/12/20/the-science-behind-long-copy-how-more-content-increases-rankings-and-conversions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  QuickSprout.com </a></u>It logically stands to reason that the more words you have on the page, the more strings search engines have to connect you to search terms. <u> <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2013/08/in-depth-articles-in-search-results.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pandu Nayak </a></u>, technical staff member at Google, went so far as to say:&ldquo;Users often turn to Google to answer a quick question, but research suggests that up to 10% of users&rsquo; daily information needs involve learning about a broad topic. That&rsquo;s why today we&rsquo;re introducing new search results to help users find in-depth articles.&rdquo;In other words: you should optimize your content plan to include quality long-form articles if you want added search engine love, featured as an &ldquo;in-depth article.&rdquo;<h3> 2. Get more social shares.</h3>Social links act as signals to the search engines that you&rsquo;ve created something worthwhile. <u> <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/12/20/the-science-behind-long-copy-how-more-content-increases-rankings-and-conversions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Marketing Expert Neil Patel </a></u> ran the numbers on his posts and found that those with greater than 1,500 words received an average of 68% more re-tweets and 22.6% more Facebook shares. He&rsquo;s not the only one to revel in such analysis.Liam Corcoran over at <u> <a href=\"http://blog.newswhip.com/index.php/2013/12/what-type-of-content-do-people-share#RAs7KVxZxlS6Th42.99\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  News Whip </a></u> noted that some of the most-shared pieces of 2013 has astounding word counts &mdash; including a 3,535 word transcription of a lecture by Neil Gaiman on the importance of reading (220,000+ shares) and <u> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/16/happiness-habits-of-exuberant-human-beings_n_3909772.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  this 2,342-word Huffington Post piece </a></u> on &ldquo;happiness habits&rdquo; (153,000+ shares).In a study of viral content, <u> <a href=\"https://growthhackers.com/articles/why-content-goes-viral-what-analyzing-100-million-articles-taught-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  OkDork.com </a></u> notes that &ldquo;the longer the content, the more shares it gets, with 3,000-10,000 word pieces getting the most average shares &mdash; 8859 total average shares.&rdquo;Kissmetrics found that the optimal number of words for a Facebook share is 2,000 &ndash; 2,500. These articles receive an average of 7,846.8 shares &mdash; which is 15% greater than articles with 0-500 words and 24% greater than articles with 500-1000 words.<img alt=\"Average Facebook Shares\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Average-Facebook-Shares.png\"/>Image Source: <u> <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/share-on-social-media/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kissmetrics.com </a></u>You&rsquo;ve got to step up your game over at LinkedIn, however. The best performing word count there was 3,500-4,000 words, averaging 251.9 shares.<h3> 3. Convert more traffic into buyers.</h3>Perhaps more telling than the number of social shares in <u> <a href=\"http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/12/20/the-science-behind-long-copy-how-more-content-increases-rankings-and-conversions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Neil Patel&rsquo;s informal analysis </a></u> was the association between word count and conversions. On average, his long-form content performed 40-50% better at converting traffic into subscribers or paying customers.Other companies observed modest &mdash; yet noteworthy &mdash; gains when they began studying the performance of their long form content. <u> <a href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2991-behind-the-scenes-ab-testing-part-3-final\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Highrise Marketing </a></u> saw a 37% increased conversion rate when running a longer version split test for a client. <u> <a href=\"http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/crazy-egg-case-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Crazy Egg </a></u> saw a 30% increase in conversions by providing their constituents with longer answers to their most pressing questions.Here and there, you will also find companies citing much higher conversion rates. <u> <a href=\"https://www.groovehq.com/blog/long-form-landing-page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GrooveHQ </a></u> improved conversions 100% with a web redesign featuring long form content after a surveyed prospect said of their site: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no narrative, the messaging is all over the place and it doesn&rsquo;t give me a single good reason to do business with you.&rdquo; <u> <a href=\"http://conversionxl.com/how-to-design-kickass-long-form-sales-pages/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Conversion XL </a></u> also cites clients who more than doubled their conversion rates using longer copy.So there you have it! As <u> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/if-you-think-short-copy-sells-more-think-again-2013-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Dr. Charles Edwards </a></u>, former dean of the Graduate School of Retailing at New York University, quickly summarized: &ldquo;The more facts you tell, the more you sell!&rdquo;<h3> 4. Stand out from the competition.</h3>Despite all we know about the merits of long form content, it seems most content producers are still unwilling to make the shift. In their analysis of viral content,<a href=\"http://okdork.com/2014/04/21/why-content-goes-viral-what-analyzing-100-millions-articles-taught-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> OkDork found</a> &ldquo;There were 16 times more content with less than 1000 words than there were content with 2000+ words.&rdquo; In turn, this means there is less competition at this level of in-depth coverage, so &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easier to stand out,&rdquo; they conclude. That&rsquo;s great news for brands looking to build a solid reputation as thought leaders and reliable sources of information within their respective industries.You Might Also Like: <u> <a href=\"/sell/digital-marketing/8-seo-copywriting-myths-to-avoid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  8 SEO Copywriting Myths To Avoid </a></u><h3> 5. Deliver more value.</h3>Not only does long form content help your business demonstrate expertise and credibility, but it also offers your audience lots of value. &ldquo;These actionable guides showcase content marketing at its most helpful, and most effective; they cover complicated topics in insane detail, and lay-out step-by-step solutions,&rdquo; <u> <a href=\"http://marketeer.kapost.com/long-form-content-marketing/#axzz3odvsWDdm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  says </a> <a href=\"http://marketeer.kapost.com/long-form-content-marketing/#axzz3odvsWDdm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Kapost </a></u>. As a result, &ldquo;You can expect their trust, gratitude and custom in return.&rdquo;In delivering more value to your customers, you&rsquo;re also pushing your internal team to delve deeper into topics relevant to your industry and expand their knowledge. So, really, you&rsquo;re providing your business with more value on multiple levels, too!<h3> 6. Keep your brand front and center.</h3>Short content has a short life cycle. Readers needn&rsquo;t invest much time into reading it and the turnover rate on your blog will be higher as a result. More comprehensive content will improve your website statistics by encouraging people to spend more time interacting with your brand. <u> <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/create-long-form-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  As Kissmetrics explains </a></u>, &ldquo;More time = more trust.&rdquo; They found that one of their longer guide pages caused people to stay on page 40% longer and look at 25% more pages than the average visitor who landed on a page with shorter content.<h3> 7. You can re-purpose it.</h3><a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/10/create-great-content-get-more-repurposing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  The Content Marketing Institute </u></a> recommends repurposing content to cut down on curation time, leverage research for use across several different projects, serve multiple audiences with different types of content and extend your content&rsquo;s longevity.Long form content is the gift that keeps giving. When you create a content gem, you can later break it up into a series of shorter articles and add visual elements or video to repackage into something new. Another option is to take the article and include it in a much longer ebook that you can sell or use to get lead emails.You May Also Like: <u> <a href=\"/sell/digital-marketing/8-ways-to-repurpose-old-content\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  8 Ways To Repurpose Old Content </a></u><h3> 8. You can profit from it directly.</h3>We can&rsquo;t promise you&rsquo;ll make a cool million off selling eBooks, but we do recommend creating this type of long form content with strategic objectives in mind. Well-written eBooks are especially useful if you&rsquo;re a B2B company with useful information to share. Zerys points out the many advantages of eBooks:<li> &ndash; They establish expert status.</li><li> &ndash; They have perceived value.</li><li> &ndash; They&rsquo;re (relatively) quick to produce.</li><li> &ndash; They&rsquo;re convenient.</li><li> &ndash; They do the selling subtly.</li><li> &ndash; They&rsquo;re interactive with tons of clickable links.</li>Using eBooks in your content marketing strategy can boost traffic to your website substantially and drive your number of leads through the roof, even if you give it away for free. If you choose to charge a small fee for the download, you can create a passive income for yourself that accumulates over time.According to the <u> 2014 B2B Content Marketing Benchmarks Report</u>, 34% of content marketers are using eBooks as a tactic, while 57% of B2B users consider eBooks to be a particularly effective tool. In addition to the benefits already mentioned, <u> <a href=\"http://www.toprankblog.com/2013/10/content-marketing-tactics-ebooks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Top Rank Blog </a></u> says that an eBook &ldquo;captures target prospect when they are most primed to buy when registering for the download&rdquo; and &ldquo;helps with search engine optimization because [the] content is searchable.&rdquo;<h3> Increase Your Conversions with Long-Form Content</h3>It goes without saying: longer content does not always produce better results. It&rsquo;s easy for beginners and untrained writers to ramble or stray off on irrelevant tangents in a pointless attempt to bloat the topic. Our writers never start out with the intention of writing to a set word count, but we often find ourselves digging our heels in pretty deep and easily surpassing the 1,000-word mark at the very least. If we can say what we need to say in fewer words, we do. If we feel the topic warrants further exploration, we go with it. We make sure that the content is designed for your audience and is relevant to your industry.","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 17:04:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 17:04:09.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_R4BXuBU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-reasons-to-use-long-form-content/\", \"post_id\": \"8831\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 17:04:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 17:04:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-reasons-to-use-long-form-content\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8829\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4194\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-You-Need-To-Get-Better-At-Selling-To-Existing-Customers.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"615\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453906800,"author_id":316,"chart_url":""}

Four Keys to Upgrade Your Leadership Communication","link":"read-the-room-four-keys-to-upgrade-your-leadership-communication","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Failure to read the room is a rampant problem in many if not most workplaces--whether we're too distracted or hurried, or too \"busy,\" we are simply not listening to and reading each other carefully.</p><h3> Those who do it well find it's a powerful asset. For those who don't, it can be anything from a necessary development step to a career-limiter.</h3><p> <br/> If you've attended too many ineffective meetings, underwhelming presentations, or informal conversations that missed the mark, then you know what it's like when someone doesn't read the room. Even socially, can you recall a time when someone was talking about themselves nonstop? Did they read the room? Not so much.</p><p> Coaching many executives and emerging leaders over the last decade, I've found the need to be better at reading the room is a common denominator to building support and credibility among colleagues, clients, and others. It's as important when you're talking through a problem with one or two colleagues in the hall as it is brainstorming the latest innovation opportunity with your leadership team.</p><h3> Four Keys</h3><p> <br/> Reading the room means doing the following four things when you're meeting with an individual or group. Note that you don't have to try and do all of them at once; practice them one by one.</p><li> <strong>  Read their signals: </strong> Listen to and watch the other(s) carefully. Their comments, questions, and physical presence/non-verbal cues are their signals to you. Read those signals and respond to them in real time. What do they really mean by what they're asking or saying--or what does their silence suggest? What's not being said but may need to be addressed? What are the most important signals to me, and how best to respond?</li><li> <strong>  Assess their absorption: </strong> From their specific questions or comments to you (or lack thereof) what do you need to adjust to match your rate of delivery well to their rate of absorption? Is the conversation moving forward, or stepping back to what was said earlier? Are their questions and comments reflecting what you had hoped would be discussed, or are you off topic? What do you need to do to fix it / move it along?</li><li> <strong>  Test their engagement: </strong> Periodically pause and ask questions that clarify their engagement with what you're saying / discussing / presenting. \"Would you like me to go into more or less detail on that?\" / \"Are we addressing what you had hoped we would?\" / \"Is there anything you've been scratching your head about that we should cover?\"</li><li> <strong>  Elevate your perspective: </strong> Keep a part of your attention hovering over the conversation and considering: How am I coming across? Am I being too long-winded, too quiet, or striking the right balance between questions, comments, and silence? Who's more tuned in and tuned out, and should I adjust accordingly? Overall, are we heading for a good result here, or should I make an adjustment? <br/>  </li><p> Looking at these four keys, it may strike you as a LOT to do, particularly when trying to cover whatever content is needed in the conversation. If you find that daunting, remember, it's a process of practice and more practice. Just think back to when you learned to drive a car--there seemed to be a lot of levers and buttons and divided attention needed. Just like learning to drive, with practice, you'll become a proficient and automatic room reader over time.</p><h3> When it's lacking or missing</h3><p> <br/> If you're wondering whether all of this practice is worthwhile, consider what it's like when it's missing. Here's what it sounds like:</p><p> \"She's super smart and loves to talk. It's impossible to get a word in so people just tune her out in meetings, and still she just keeps going on and on.\"</p><p> \"He comes across as too junior for his role. He always goes into too much technical detail and it sounds like he's too far in the weeds to know the big picture. He gets the feedback but doesn't understand why he comes across that way.\"</p><p> \"When she presents to the Board, it's too much content and no recognition on her part they need time for discussion. They're really wanting to zoom in on one or two things, and she's 10 pages ahead.\"</p><p> \"When I'm talking to him in my one on one meetings, he seems very distracted.

{"original_id":4041,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Better Prospecting: How to Avoid 5 Common Pitfalls","link":"better-prospecting-how-to-avoid-5-common-pitfalls","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Many of my clients ask me for advice about successful prospecting, especially when it's something that their sales people are struggling with. Developing new business, prospecting, cold calling can certainly be the most challenging part of the sales process. After all, you are interrupting somebody's day. It's almost like being on a first date, testing the waters, making sure that there is alignment.</p><p> But, that's exactly what's missing in many situations when sales people are calling on prospects. I.e.: making sure that there is a potential fit.</p><p> Try to put yourself into your prospect's shoes. What would you want to hear when you pick up the phone where somebody is interrupting your day? Would you want to hear a sales pitch, or would you want to listen to somebody who is potentially adding value to your life?</p><p> In this blog, I&rsquo;d like to shine a light on 5 common pitfalls you can avoid when prospecting.</p><h3> Getting the Right Fit</h3><p> <br/> Just as in trying on a new suit &ndash; if it&rsquo;s not the right fit you wouldn&rsquo;t buy it. Right? The same holds true in sales - If there is no fit, there is no motivating reason to have a sales conversation. But in order for you, the sales person, to determine if this prospect could be a client, you need to do your homework first. Most sales representatives who call me don't know my business, have never visited my website or my LinkedIn profile. They are just rattling off a sales pitch, in the worst case scenario using a bad script and in some cases they even stutter around trying to get to a point (leaving me to wonder: why they are using a script in the first place?).</p><p> So, don't look for a fit if there is none. No matter how much research you do and how well you prepare for a call, sometimes it&rsquo;s better to move on. Don't push it, there is no sense in trying to find alignment if there is none. Reasons can be plentiful.</p><p> For my own business, I have found that some companies don't want to commit to a long-term sales process, which means that they are not really committed to a consultative sales approach. I could push them, but it wouldn't lead to a successful client engagement. Sometimes, it's best to leave a good impression and to move on.</p><p> <strong>  So, the first common pitfall to avoid is: </strong> Calling a potential prospect NOTknowing anything about them, their potential needs or even their name and looking for a fit if there is NONE!</p><h3> A Script is a Guideline</h3><p> <br/> There is nothing wrong with using a script, as long as it is used a guideline. The script or guideline also needs to include potential answers to questions that the prospect could possibly ask. It's almost like envisioning a scenario and preparing to respond. A script should also be a living document rather than a static instrument. It needs to be changed on a regular basis, whenever the environment shifts, which in this business environment happens quite frequently. Your competitors can change, so can regulation and mandates.</p><p> <strong>  Second common pitfall:  </strong> Rattling off a pitch using a script that might not be suited for the prospect&rsquo;s current needs.</p><h3> Be Brief, Distinct and add VALUE!</h3><p> <br/> People will appreciate it when you get to the point fast. And by that I mean that you need to have a value statement. Let me give you an example. When I call on organizations with a national or global presence to present our sales training, I always focus on the fact that we help companies increase revenue and profitability by helping them establish a common, customer-centric sales and service language across a large sales organization. That is something of importance and value for organizations with sales people widely spread around the country, or the globe for that matter. But this value statement works most accurately for companies with a large sales force in multiple locations!</p><p> If you have been a reader of my newsletter, you&rsquo;ll know how much we stress NOTto focus on features and benefits solely. Features and benefits can be used to support your value statement at a later point in the conversation.</p><p> For example, the fact that our training programs use a blended e-Learning/customized coaching approach is something that supports the fact that we help our clients increase revenue and profitability by establishing a common, customer-centric sales and service language across a diverse, decentralized organization.</p><p> It's not something that needs to be mentioned first, especially since there are many other providers who claim to have effective on-line training. It's not a differentiator and e-Learning might not be something that is attractive to a company at first.</p><p> How you get to the results that are of value for your client is not something that you necessarily want to lead with.</p><p> <strong>  Third common pitfall:  </strong> Focusing on features and benefits, rather than focusing on the value that your solution provides to your prospect.</p><h3> Know Who You Are Talking To</h3><p> <br/> When calling on people, try to understand their role within the organization and their responsibilities. When I call on a CEO (which is always my first outreach, as I have found it's more effective to work your way down, rather than up the ladder), I always focus on the overall business goals. Top line value statements. Increased revenue and higher profitability are messages that resonate with CEOs.</p><p> Once I get to the sales or training manager, my message shifts. Then it's more about the nitty-gritty, the details, ins and outs of the program. Of course, increased revenue and higher profitability are also important to the sales manager, but they also want to make sure that their people don't spend too much time away from their desks, so I talk about the fact that their sales people never have to leave their desk and they will still become more successful.</p><p> <strong>  Fourth common pitfall: </strong>  Not knowing what the purchasing motivations of each individual decision maker are.</p><h3> Be Personal</h3><p> <br/> In closing - people buy from people. Be personal. Don't try to &ldquo;sell them&rdquo;. We all know that the goal of a sales person is to sell, and that is perfectly acceptable - nothing wrong with that. And in contrast to being &ldquo;sold&rdquo;, I prefer to buy from people who genuinely understand my business and approach me with a value proposition that will help me make my company more successful.</p><p> But, first you need to connect with me, figure out how best to communicate with me. Then you need to know my business and understand my challenges. Once you have established rapport (and there&rsquo;s a science to that, and as with any communication skill, it can be learned!), it's much easier to have a conversation and to build trust.</p><p> <strong>  Fifth common pitfall:  </strong> Moving from one prospect to the next, without taking the time to really connect and listen.</p><p> And yes, you can learn how to be a SuperSeller TM and become a top prospector.

It&rsquo;s not something anyone wants to think about, but when it does happen, it&rsquo;s vital to know what, when, and how to take care of your finances to be sure you protect your assets and get on to solid footing moving forward.</p><p> How do you even begin to go about such an overwhelming task when your life has just changed completely? As a rule, we women are incredibly strong and able to rise to the tasks ahead&mdash;no matter what they may be&mdash;but one key to success is not going it alone. <strong>  Now is the time to put together your A-team. </strong></p><h3> Liz, in her mid-70s, took a fall and was in a short-term rehab facility when her husband died unexpectedly.</h3><p> <br/> She suddenly had to manage everything from funeral arrangements to estate planning issues&mdash;all while being stuck in a hospital bed herself. Luckily for Liz, she had a lot of help from her daughter, Emily. Not only was Emily there to help do the legwork Liz couldn&rsquo;t manage herself&mdash;everything from grabbing documents from her husband&rsquo;s safe deposit box to meeting with the funeral director&mdash;but Emily also advised her to get immediate help to tackle the legal and financial aspects of dealing with her husband&rsquo;s death. As a longtime client of mine, Emily recommended she call me first. When Liz and I talked that day, <strong>  the first thing we did was put together her A-team&mdash;a group of seven individuals who each play a critical role helping her begin her life without her husband. </strong></p><h3> Widowed or not, if you don&rsquo;t already have an A-team in place, here are the seven players I recommend every woman find and recruit right away: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Your person. </strong>  The TV show Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy coined the phrase, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my person.&rdquo; It stuck, and for good reason. Everyone needs that one person they can count on, no matter what. For Liz, her &ldquo;person&rdquo; was Emily. For you, it may be an adult child, colleague, neighbor, family member, or best friend. Your &ldquo;person&rdquo; is the one you can trust to be there when you need help and who makes you feel safe. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Your executor, successor, or co-trustee. </strong>  An executor or trustee is responsible for making sure all assets of the deceased are accounted for and transferred to the right party, and to ensure that all debts and taxes are paid. An executor is legally obligated to meet your husband&rsquo;s wishes as indicated in the will or Trust, and to act in the best interest of all beneficiaries. In most cases, this will be you&mdash;the new widow. Acknowledge that you need help with this big job. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Your attorney. </strong>  I&rsquo;ve had multiple clients ask, &ldquo;Do I really need to pay for an attorney?&rdquo; The answer: YES. While it may seem attractive to &ldquo;save&rdquo; legal fees by dealing with probate, estate, and trust issues yourself or by getting help from a friend, you need a professional who understands every aspect of what must be done. Ask people you trust for recommendations, and then choose the professional who feels right for you. Getting appropriate legal help will save you headaches&mdash;and money&mdash;later on. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Your accountant. </strong>  Tax strategies can play a significant role in preserving your assets following the death of your spouse. I can&rsquo;t underestimate the value of a good CPA to help you protect your estate. If you don&rsquo;t already have a trusted accountant, again, get recommendations from others&mdash;preferably women who have been through your situation themselves. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Your banker. </strong>  In the immediate future, you&rsquo;ll need cash to maintain your lifestyle&mdash;especially if any of your assets are tied up in probate. Your banker can help you identify all available funds, give you access to available cash (note that some funds may not be accessible for some time), and help you take over your husband&rsquo;s banking responsibilities. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Your insurance agent. </strong>  At the top of your to-do list will be contacting the companies with which your husband holds life insurance policies. A good insurance agent will help with much more than that. As a widow, your needs have changed. Your agent can help identify appropriate life and health insurance to be sure you&mdash;and those who depend on you&mdash;are protected. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Your financial advisor.  </strong> Just last month a new widow was referred to me by her estate planning attorney. Her first question to me: &ldquo;If I have a CPA and an attorney, why do I need you?&rdquo; I explained that the role of a financial advisor (myself or another) was to invest her assets appropriately, help her work through her financial to-do lists, and create an individual plan for her financial future. As a fiduciary, I would also quarterback the actions of everyone on her team on her behalf, making sure everyone is working together toward her success.Four weeks later, we&rsquo;ve assessed her financial big picture, adjusted her personal portfolio (her husband&rsquo;s assets have not yet been turned over to her), worked with an insurance agent to get her proper coverage now that her husband is gone, and continued working closely with herestate planning attorney. We still have a lot to do, but I know our work has already helped her gain a new level of financial confidence. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  When you are a new widow, you are swirling in emotion. </strong> Yet there are so many things you must manage immediately. From obtaining death certificates to poring through legal documents, paying bills, and more, you have too much on your plate. The good news you&rsquo;ve been waiting for is this: with your A-team in place, you&rsquo;ll have all the help you need to increase your sense of independence and gain control over your life.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 17:42:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 17:42:23.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_iHohvbe.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-all-feels-lost-its-time-to-find-your-a-team/\", \"post_id\": \"8837\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 17:42:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 17:42:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-all-feels-lost-its-time-to-find-your-a-team\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8836\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4197\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/When-All-Feels-Lost-Its-Time-to-Find-Your-A-Team.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"785\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453896900,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}

Many will no longer wait to be picked for that job, promotion or project. An increasing number of people will start picking themselves and setting their own path as they see life as a daring adventure, where work is just one element of it.  <u>  <a href=\"http://lifeworking.eventbrite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LIFEworking  </a> </u>  will be a way of life. We will start asking ourselves,what&rsquo;s my enough? and realizing that we want to set our own path and follow our own journey; not someone else&rsquo;s story.</p><p> Over the next 25 years, people will choose to join organizations with shared purpose that value people. Purpose will become much more important to people than mission statements that hang on corporate walls. Trust, relationships and community will be the currencies that matter more in a world where people will choose to focus on  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business for good  </a> </u> . This journey has already begun with a wide range of organizations moving in the direction of beingpowered by purpose. Today, people are becoming much more conscious of the food they consume as more organizations tell us that the food they produce is poison free. Today&rsquo;s packaging inform the consumer that their food does not contain harmful ingredients. In the future, more people will question whether working for a certain company will damage their health and wellbeing, as well as whether the company&rsquo;s practices are good for society and the planet.</p><h3> Research has shown that the companies that do good in the world return more profits to their shareholders than their counterparts &mdash; those who do harm.</h3><p> <br/> Staying competitive in today&rsquo;s socially conscious climate means more than having good products and being profitable. Not only are people more likely to buy from brands that share their social values, they are willing to spend more on their products, are nearly twice as loyal and employees are more than 50% more engaged and nearly 20% more productive. As Gina Manis-Anderson of  <u>  <a href=\"http://saviigroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Savii Group  </a> </u>  tells us, &ldquo;Turns out doing good is good for business.&rdquo;</p><h3> Innovation should never be a department. </h3><p> <br/> In today&rsquo;s world, many organizations focus on innovation and yet do not have the systems to allow for true innovation which include experimentation that often leads to the failure that is associated with it. In the future of work, we will make choices that sustain us and we will not be constrained by internal systems like incentive plans that restrict our ability to experiment and fail. Innovation will be exciting as it will be in the fabric of how we work and collaborate. With shared purpose, people will bring innovation to their day-to-day practices and have the freedom to create. The artist needs freedom to create. And we are all artists, makers, creators and doers in business.</p><h3> A call to action. </h3><p> <br/> Imagine what could happen if we no longer needed to fight for our lives and we simply lived fully and co-created the world we want to live in where business is a force of good?

{"original_id":4044,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Killer Moths, KonMari And Cash","link":"killer-moths-konmari-and-cash","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Last week I discovered we&rsquo;d been invaded by stealthy killer moths.</h3><p> <br/> The nasty little beasts ate their way through my (I thought) carefully stored wools and cashmeres&mdash;and even had the audacity to nibble on my favorite 1920&rsquo;s vintage silk scarf.</p><p> At first, I thought it was confined to my closet. And then we discovered them in my husband&rsquo;s closet. And the coat closet. And finally, nestled in with the linens.</p><p> The only permanent cure is to remove every last item and dry-clean it, wash it or freeze it (twice). Then come the exterminators and the carpet cleaners and the disinfectants. Every. Single. Surface.</p><h3> Ugh.</h3><p> <br/> But here&rsquo;s the thing. Those damned moths FORCED me to look at every piece of clothing and every last speck of linen. Did I love it enough to invest in dry cleaning? Did it still fit? Was it right for the life I live now? Did it bring me joy?</p><p> Which brings me to the KonMari Method. I&rsquo;d heard about Marie Kondo&rsquo;s book on the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing:  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing-ebook/dp/B00KK0PICK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453661948&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tidying+up\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  and figured now was as good a time as any to read it. Between bouts of laundry and trips to goodwill, I devoured not only that book, but her follow-up as well. (Tip: if you get into her method, you must have her &ldquo;Spark Joy&rdquo; book if only for her folding instructions.)</p><p> The lightbulb flashed in neon. What good was any possession if it didn&rsquo;t make me happy? What good was having so much if it kept me from seeing what really mattered?</p><p> Now I have to admit cleaning out my closet had been on my mind for awhile&mdash;my Chicago winter clothes I never wear here in LA and more than a few fashion items past their prime had been nagging at me. But I was both exceedingly busy with my work, and more than a little stymied about letting go of my beautiful clothes.</p><p> It took the killer moths to get me moving and KonMari to give me the framework (joy) to make the changes I needed. We are 29 recycle and goodwill bags and counting into this process with I&rsquo;m quite sure many more to come (for you KonMari aficionados, we have just finished the book stage).</p><h3> So here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going with this. It&rsquo;s not just about closets and &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. Our businesses need this same brand of diligence. What sparks joy? What work or clients should we be spotlighting?</h3><p> <br/> And what has already served its purpose? What are you ready to let go (or gift or sell to someone else) that will allow you to focus on what has the deepest meaning for you?</p><p> And yet the problem is, we tend to do this kind of house-cleaning&mdash;of soul-searching&mdash;only when we&rsquo;re on the verge of crisis. When something is so bad (think killer moths eating through your favorite beauties), we are forced to it.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t wait until you can&rsquo;t ignore it.</h3><p> <br/> Because here&rsquo;s how the universe works. The second&mdash;literally the second&mdash;you start on this sort of quest, the energy and dynamic around you shifts.</p><p> In my case, I had just finished the first round of KonMari and had jumped out of the shower when I grabbed my phone to check messages. There was an auto-message that I&rsquo;d unexpectedly sold a product&mdash;one I hadn&rsquo;t promoted in over a year. Yep&mdash;cash. The next day my husband got word he&rsquo;d been granted a never-been-done-before off-cycle raise. That evening our celebratory meal was comped when the restaurant made a mistake and the manager wanted us to enjoy ourselves.</p><p> Coincidence? I think not. More like fuel to keep using joy as our yardstick. For stuff. For work. For life.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 17:59:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 17:59:26.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_c5UZQ1i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/killer-moths-konmari-and-cash/\", \"post_id\": \"8842\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 17:59:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 17:59:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"killer-moths-konmari-and-cash\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8841\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4199\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Killer-Moths-KonMari-And-Cash_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"759\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453921200,"author_id":407,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4046,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Things Truly Innovative Startups Never Do","link":"4-things-truly-innovative-startups-never-do","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> No word in the startup lexicon is more overused and misunderstood than &ldquo;innovation.&rdquo; It gets thrown around so often that entrepreneurs tend to forget that innovation isn&rsquo;t inherent to startups -- it&rsquo;s the result of hard work.</h3><p> <br/> Innovation blossoms from a continual dedication to solving problems and delivering greater value, and even a company that starts out with a unique offering or business model can&rsquo;t maintain innovation without focus, intent and alignment.</p><p> <strong>  Consider Amazon: </strong> The e-commerce giant has preserved its startup spirit for more than 20 years because its executive team understands the need to <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2015/the-peculiar-traits-of-great-amazon-leaders-frugal-innovative-and-body-odor-that-doesnt-smell-like-perfume/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  constantly experiment </a> and improve the customer experience with offerings such as Amazon Prime, Kindle Unlimited and Echo. Amazon empowers employees to find solutions on their own, then work quickly to bring those to fruition.</p><p> Startups disrupting the status quo all work in different ways, but there are four things truly innovative companies don&rsquo;t do:</p><h3> 1. Overthink and prolong taking action.</h3><p> <br/> Discussing potential solutions to a problem often feels safer than taking action, but innovating in a theoretical capacity robs your startup of valuable lessons and prevents you from exploring all possible outcomes. Don&rsquo;t let your team become paralyzed by &ldquo;what ifs.&rdquo;</p><p> I&rsquo;m teaching my daughters how to surf, and I give them the same advice I gave my team to keep them from overthinking: Once you understand the basic principle, you just have to dive in and try it. Yes, you&rsquo;re going to fall and get bruised, but you can&rsquo;t truly understand the dynamic environment around you until you stand up and feel the wave under your feet.</p><h3> 2. Create rigid structures.</h3><p> <br/> Cultures where team members feel compelled to ask for the boss&rsquo;s approval are built on hierarchies that crush experimentation. In the startup world, it&rsquo;s much better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.</p><p> Even Facebook <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/zuckerberg-move-fast-and-break-things-isnt-how-we-operate-anymore/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  was built </a> on the motto &ldquo;move fast and break things.&rdquo; It celebrated failure -- <u>  <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/facebooks-early-days-developers-congratulatory-email-crashing-site/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   even bugs that crashed the site  </a> </u> -- because mistakes were a sign that people were moving quickly and challenging the status quo.</p><p> Giving your team carte blanche to take risks will ultimately benefit your startup, but you must support this ideology with your actions. I&rsquo;m usually the first person to break the most expensive piece of new technology in the office, but I believe it helps create an environment where my team feels safe to experiment.</p><h3> 3. Shy away from conflict.</h3><p> <br/> Conflict is the result of passionate dedication to an idea and an essential component of innovative cultures. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/10/4823296/jeff-bezos-book-excerpts-published-by-bloomberg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   detests &ldquo;social cohesion&rdquo;  </a> </u> and <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   actively encourages  </a> </u> leaders to &ldquo;have backbone; disagree and commit.&rdquo;</p><p> Conflict is also a natural byproduct of working in an environment with diverse perspectives. I spent 10 years as a creative director blending technology and visual design, and I found that the greatest victories came from the seamless integration of teams with different goals. The trick is building a culture where every idea is respected and valued to nurture healthy disagreements and minimize destructive conflict.</p><h3> 4. Get comfortable in their routines.</h3><p> <br/> Running a company requires finding the most efficient way to deliver the most value.

Investments in companies other than oil producers, particularly those that benefit from cheaper oil prices, may deliver good results in the coming year.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1_8.png\" width=\"535\"/></p><p> And the bond market hasn&rsquo;t been immune. Yields on below-investment grade bonds in particular spiked to levels not seen since 2012.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"223\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.45.19-AM.png\" width=\"537\"/></p><p> But why have the U.S. markets reacted so strongly to the Chinese market and oil prices? Has the U.S. economy encountered an unexpected pothole? Have an excessive amount of U.S. businesses or homeowners declared bankruptcy? Have scandals erupted in key corporations? Has the U.S. Congress threatened to shut down the government rather than pass a budget? No, none of these things has happened. Yes, industrial production and corporate profits have hit a bit of a slump. But the U.S. job market &ndash; probably the best indicator of imminent recession &ndash; continues to rebound with 292,000 new jobs in December and 2.7 million new jobs for the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"203\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.50.20-AM.png\" width=\"486\"/></p><p> <img src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/learn/fixed-income\"/> To recap the past few months in the Chinese stock market, as reported by The Economist (January 25, 2016), in early July 2015 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21657395-panicked-response-tumbling-stocks-casts-doubt-pace-reform-china-embraces\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  China's stock market crash </a> ed with share prices dropping by a third, wiping out some $3.5 trillion in wealth (more than the total value of India&rsquo;s stock market).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.51.26-AM.png\" width=\"411\"/></p><p> A further plunge on August 24 followed by a fall of similar proportions the next day sent share prices down over 40% below their 2015 peak.</p><p> Since the summer, the Chinese stock market had rebounded approximately 20%, so one hoped that the worst was over. Unfortunately, on January 4th and again on January 7th the CSI 300 index of &lsquo;blue chip&rsquo; Chinese stocks fell approximately 7% and fears of a serious economic decline were renewed.</p><p> Given that that Chinese stock market has indeed experienced a challenging 6 months, how can we extrapolate the severity of the problem to U.S. investors? Ultimately, the value of any stock market should reflect the profitability of domestic businesses.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"219\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.45.49-AM.png\" width=\"415\"/></p><p> On January 19th, China reported its official annual GDP growth figure for 2015 at 6.9%, just a shade lower than 2014&rsquo;s 7.3%, and much stronger than average global forecast GDP of 2.8%, reported by the Conference Board.org in November 2015.</p><p> The worry seems to be that the official GDP figure may be manipulated by the Chinese government and that much worse lies ahead.</p><p> But how much of the decline in the Chinese economy should legitimately be reflected in the U.S. economy? It is difficult to calculate a precise figure, but for context see the table below. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.53.15-AM.png\" width=\"519\"/></p><p> As of November 2015, China was indeed the largest trade partner with the U.S., so changes in their economy could definitely impact ours. However, note that exports &ndash; which bring profits to U.S. businesses &ndash; are much smaller than imports. This should buffer the impact of the Chinese decline somewhat. So troubles in the Chinese economy can indeed impact the U.S., though by how much is very difficult to say.</p><h3> But what about falling oil prices?</h3><p> <br/> As an input to so much of what we consume, lower oil prices depress final goods prices &ndash; including gasoline &ndash; which leaves more money in consumers&rsquo; pocket to buy other things. Yes, a severe drop in oil prices driven by a </p><p> lack of demand would definitely indicate a recession, but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening these past months. The problem is an overabundance of supply.</p><p> With the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S., crude oil production in the U.S. has spiked to levels not seen in the last 30 years. With OPEC countries maintaining production near historic levels, and global demand increasing only modestly, basic laws of economics indicate that the market price of oil must fall.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.54.05-AM.png\" width=\"507\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-10.45.52-AM.png\" width=\"518\"/></p><h3> So where does that leave us?</h3><p> <br/> Yes, we should be concerned about the market turmoil in China as that country adjusts to a slower, but still strong, growth rate of their economy. Declining oil prices caused by excess supply is a good thing for consumers, but will depress profits of oil producers which can be a large component of stock market indexes.</p><p> On balance, the U.S. economy remains on an upward trajectory. Recent declines in the stock and bond markets should be viewed as a buying opportunity. But be selective! Companies whose revenues are strongly tied to the price of oil may continue to struggle until supply and demand reach a new equilibrium.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 18:54:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 18:54:37.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_js50MWQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-is-the-turmoil-in-china-and-the-drop-in-oil-prices-depressing-the-u-s-markets/\", \"post_id\": \"8855\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 18:54:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 18:54:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-is-the-turmoil-in-china-and-the-drop-in-oil-prices-depressing-the-u-s-markets\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8845\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4202\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Things-Truly-Innovative-Startups-Never-Do.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1049\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453927500,"author_id":463,"chart_url":""}

They&rsquo;re the foundation of marketing and without them, your marketing investments have very little chance of driving the results you want and need.</p><p> <strong>  The 4 Rights of Marketing Are&hellip; </strong></p><li> Right message to the</li><li> Right audience at the</li><li> Right time in the</li><li> Right place. <br/>  </li><p> The hard part comes when you try to figure out what the right message, the right audience, the right time, and the right place are for each of your marketing investments.</p><h3> 1. The Right Message</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t craft a compelling message that hypes the benefits which truly matter to the target audience unless you can identify and understand that audience first.</p><p> Think of it this way&mdash;if your ad hypes your restaurant&rsquo;s low prices but your audience cares far more about quality of food and service than prices, your ad won&rsquo;t generate the return on investment you need.</p><h3> 2. The Right Audience</h3><p> <br/> You have to research the audience to identify specific target segments because one size does not fit all in marketing. In other words, one message does not fit all in marketing.</p><p> For example, many people hire residential cleaning companies to clean their homes, but different audience segments do so for very different needs. A young, working couple might hire a cleaning company because they simply don&rsquo;t have time to clean while an elderly person might hire a cleaning company because they&rsquo;re not physically able to clean their own homes.</p><p> These disparate audience segments would respond better to different messages, but you&rsquo;d never know that if you didn&rsquo;t first know your audience and segment them.</p><h3> 3. The Right Time</h3><p> <br/> You have to make sure your marketing campaigns get in front of people when they&rsquo;re receptive to them or your efforts will be useless. Timing matters a lot in marketing and it&rsquo;s probably the &ldquo;right&rdquo; that you&rsquo;ll have to experiment with the most.</p><h3> 4. The Right Place</h3><p> <br/> People need to see your marketing messages when they&rsquo;re in a place that they&rsquo;re not only receptive to receive them but also capable of responding to them.</p><p> Every person in the world is not going to see every ad in the world. It&rsquo;s your job as the marketer to find the best placement to ensure the target audience sees it. Before you can write your ad, you have to place your ad.</p><h3> The Takeaway</h3><p> <br/> Make sure every marketing initiative is built on a solid foundation of the 5 Rights of Marketing, and remember, you&rsquo;re unlikely to get it right the first time. Increasing the return on your marketing investments requires testing, revising, and testing again.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-26 19:11:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-26 19:11:04.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_jJIwa06.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-rights-of-marketing/\", \"post_id\": \"8857\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-26 19:11:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-26 19:11:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-rights-of-marketing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8856\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4203\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4-Rights-of-Marketing.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"547\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453925100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Main Street, Mooresville, North Carolina 28115","link":"123-n-main-street-mooresville-north-carolina-28115","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Located approximately 25 miles north of Charlotte, Mooresville, North Carolina is the home of several NASCAR drivers and racing teams.</h3><strong> In fact, it is nicknamed \"Race City USA.\"</strong>It isn&rsquo;t the first place that would come to mind when thinking fashion design. Yet, here, on a historic stretch of Main Street, is the starting block for many future designers, taught by a true Hollywood fashion designer.Owner<strong> Shawnelle Cherry</strong>graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM) in Los Angeles and from the UCLA extension program where she studied costume design for film.  She worked in the Los Angeles garment industry before starting her own design studio in Pacific Palisades, California. There, she specialized in evening gowns for the Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes and the Daytime Emmy Awards. In 1995, five of her gowns were worn at the Oscars. During her 20 years in Hollywood, Cherry also had <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0156114\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  a list of more than 30 films to her credit. </u>  </a>When she got engaged, she moved to Mooresville and decided to start her own business. The idea came about as her father was going through treatments for lung cancer. She read the book, <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Month-Live-Thirty-No-Regrets/dp/0307730964/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448336844&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=One+Month+to+Live\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  \"One Month to Live: Thirty Days to a No-Regrets Life\" by Kerry Shook.  </a></u> Cherry asked herself what she really wanted to do. \"I discovered what would really feed my soul was to share my talents and teach kids (of all ages) my passion for the art.&rdquo;While the engagement didn&rsquo;t last, the business did. She stayed in Mooresville, opened her doors in January 2010 and offered classes in sewing and design. Students do everything in the process from sketching to draping and sewing. They also show off their work on the runway.<h3> Cherry&rsquo;s busiest time is summer, when she has camps from June through August.</h3><img alt=\"\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-26-at-11.21.36-AM.png\" width=\"752\"/>Students as young as 8-years-old sign up for half-day and full-day beginner and intermediate classes. Last summer, almost all the slots were quickly filled.While there are some other businesses like this in New York and San Francisco, this is the only designer academy in the area. Students come from as far away as South Carolina. Many of the kids Cherry mentors end up continuing with their talents and study fashion design at North Carolina State or Savannah College of Art and Design.Cherry is passionate about her desire to share her skills and lifetime of experience with kids of all ages and skill levels. To expand her reach, in addition to her in-house classes, she has started <u> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/projectsewway/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Project Sew*Way </a></u>, an online subscription program where kids can get projects mailed to them on a monthly basis.&ldquo;Many kids know how to sew,&rdquo; Cherry says, &ldquo;but if they go and pick their own projects, sometimes they are too hard and when they are too hard, they sometimes just quit.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Cherry says happened during her childhood. She just doesn&rsquo;t want kids to stop when they have the interest. &ldquo;We send them the fabric, thread, stuffing, everything they need to do the project.&rdquo;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/wow\"/><h3> The hope is that these easy-to-do projects will not only spark imagination, but also build confidence by seeing ideas take form.</h3><strong> Kids are able to build their self-esteem and confidence because they are able to complete the projects.</strong> Even though the kits can be sent anywhere in the world, Cherry keeps connected via an online community.Now more than six years out of the frantic pace of Hollywood, Cherry notes how much she really likes downtown's revitalized Main Street and Mooresville (<strong> which is growing so quickly it now has a second zip code</strong>). She adds that there are some perks to having the 123 N. Main Street address. &ldquo;I get some of the funniest mail,&rdquo; she says, noting that hers is often used as a test address.

Despite that music, most of us who lived through the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s did so without too much lasting damage.</p><h3> I suspect that every generation looks askance at the one that follows them.</h3><p> <br/> Just as women seem perpetually mystified by men and men by women, so too do we become befuddled by the wants, needs, desires, and motivation of younger generations.</p><p> Recently, I was talking to a CEO (who shall remain nameless) who opined &ldquo;Millennials are Strange,Disloyal, and Indulged.&rdquo; Since those words don&rsquo;t seem to fit the Millennials that I have raised (nor the ones with whom I have become acquainted both personally and professionally), I&rsquo;ve set out to use the letters that started his descriptors to define Millennials differently. <strong>  My S, D, and I words are: SKEPTICAL, DISCERNING, and INFORMED. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Millennials certainly have every right to be SKEPTICAL. </strong> They watched many of their parents errantly believe politicians, advertisers, and the media &ndash; only to find that some of those messengers strayed from the truth or at least &ldquo;spun&rdquo; it. Millennials are native to the &ldquo;new media&rdquo; where events are documented in real time by people like themselves who offer eyewitness accounts on Twitter. They look to reviews of peers, not to hype from marketers.</p><p> <strong>  Millennials are DISCERNING. </strong> From an early age they have been besieged by choices. They have had to learn to manage options, information overload and make quick decisions on where they will dedicate their energy and attention.</p><p> Millennials are INFORMED. As a youth, if I wanted to learn more about a subject I had to be near my encyclopedia or a library. Today, knowledge lives at the tips of our fingers.</p><p> In addition to my S, D and I view of Millennials, research shows they are EXPERIENCE SEEKERS.

{"original_id":4051,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Niche Marketing for Advisors – A Low-Risk Means to Grow Your Business","link":"niche-marketing-for-advisors-a-low-risk-means-to-grow-your-business","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Many advisors we work with fear the same thing when asked about focusing on niche markets, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I will lose business.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> The reality is, firms that hone their focus on specialty services, specific products, and specific needs are more appealing than those offering general services to a broad market. Identifying niches is a low-risk means to grow your business.</p><p> The first step is to understand the difference between target and niche markets:</p><li> A target market is the identified group of people your firm serves</li><li> A niche market is comprised of specialty services you offer to small groups within your target market <br/>  </li><h3> How to Identify Your Niche Market(s)</h3><p> <br/> Niche marketing falls out of the normal realm of mainstream business. It involves focusing and marketing to a limited group of people with a specific message linked to your product and services.</p><p> Some helpful tips when choosing your niche markets is to think about your passions, ties within your community, and your existing client base. Determine how you can build a niche market from the connections you have. Identify your niche with a narrow focus, but remain flexible to expand as new business is generated. Utilize the following guidelines and questions when identifying your niche:</p><li> <strong>  Choose niche markets by defining high degrees of specialization for groups of people and their specific needs. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Create a value statement specific to your niche that details why and how you are relevant to them. If your niche doesn&rsquo;t understand how you can meet their needs, there is no opportunity. </strong></li><li> <strong>  How many people/businesses are in this niche market &ndash; will it nourish your firm? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do you have easy access to this group of people or the ability to gain an introduction? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Does this niche market need your services? Do you offer specific solutions to meet their needs? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do you understand the needs of this niche? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will you enjoy working with this group of people? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Niche markets give you the opportunity to clearly differentiate your firm from others and position yourself as an expert in the industry.</p><h3> How to Make the Most of Your Niches to Gain Market Share</h3><p> <br/> Batch and blast marketing methods are outdated. Marketing to your niche is all about personalization.</p><p> Your market will not respond to generic marketing unless it specifically applies to them at a given moment. Time, effort, and cost are wasted on blindly marketing meaningless, non-specific products and services. The means in which you communicate with each group requires uniqueness.</p><p> Once you have identified your niches and the market needs of each group, craft marketing messages that resonate specifically to your niche. Personalized messages are essential to the success of a niche marketing plan. By offering clients and prospects services and products they want and need, you are much more likely to convert them to buying clients.</p><p> Think about the 80/20 rule: focus on the 20 percent that matter. Eighty percent of your target market probably won&rsquo;t buy from you, but when you identify the 20% who are most likely to become clients, you give your firm a laser-like focus. Without that focus, you expose yourself to presenting a message that does not resonate with 80% of your market.</p><h3> Glean New Clients from Your Niche</h3><p> <br/> By placing focus on the niches you have identified, your ability to hone in on select groups and provide specialized service will open the door to more referrals. But, you have to be willing to do some work.</p><p> Simply asking for a referral, without providing a descriptive landscape, makes it difficult for others to refer an ideal and compatible potential client. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to steer your clients, alliances, and centers of influence in the proper direction with a clear and concise description of the type of client you are looking for. Be specific. For example, remind them of the specialty service you offer that may benefit their peers at &ldquo;ABC Company.&rdquo;</p><h3> Benefits of Niches</h3><p> <br/> By identifying a market position or niche, you will be on the path to increased operational effectiveness, success, and a clear vision for you and your firm. Your service and product offerings will be aligned with your niche, thus providing a solution to client&rsquo;s unique needs.</p><p> When you identify and market to a niche, your firm is:</p><li> <strong>  More likely to have an impact:  </strong> Strong positions in a target market provide your business with identity.</li><li> <strong>  Able to stand apart from competitors: </strong>  Your firm is positioned to connect and engage in meaningful solutions to specific needs.</li><li> <strong>  Positioned to grow organically: </strong>  By providing laser-focus service, your clients will be marketing your firm for you. <br/>  </li><p> Ironstone&rsquo;s vision is to forge and guide the personal and professional lives of entrepreneurs and business professionals alike to realize their full potential.

It&rsquo;s a way to ensure that your customers are confident through every step in the transaction and that they&rsquo;re coming to you to fill a need they can&rsquo;t fill anywhere else.</p><p> Being considered the generic and/or being classified as a commodity are the paths of decline. Brand differentiation is the path of growth. </p><h3> Get your strategy in place</h3><p> <br/> Marketing tactics are good, but they&rsquo;re short-term. In order to differentiate, you have to think strategically before you think tactically: what&rsquo;s the long-term strategy that will define your approach to the market? Who is your ideal client? You may be familiar with the 80/20 rule: most businesses get 80% of their revenue from 20% of their consumer base. Find your 20%, and be assiduous in meeting their needs.</p><p> In order to meet those needs, you need to understand the core difference in what you offer, compared to everyone else on the market.  Do you&hellip;</p><li> Provide a unique product?</li><li> Offer a unique service?</li><li> Serve an under-served market niche?</li><li> Rely on special offers?</li><li> Solve a problem no one else can solve?</li><li> Provide value?</li><li> Offer guarantees?</li><li> Provide a customer-centric approach?</li><li> Have a novel way of doing business?</li><li> Outperform your competition? <br/>  </li><p> Look to your current clients to find out what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not. This is a good time to update your SWOT analyses: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats can change as your brand evolves. Once you have your data and your ideal client in mind, rework your mission to serve that niche, and then share your story.</p><h3> Three major factors contribute to brand perception. Your company should live and work by all of them: <br/>  </h3><li> Your core values</li><li> Your mission</li><li> Your vision</li><h3> <br/> Things your customers should be able to tell you <br/>  </h3><li> What attracted your customers to your services? How did their confidence increase from their first awareness of you to the point of sale?</li><li> What do they get from your products or services that they can&rsquo;t find elsewhere?</li><li> What don&rsquo;t they get from your products or services that they need? <br/>  </li><p> With this information in hand, you can create a difference summary. This defines how your company sets itself apart, how it satisfies your consumers, and how your consumers are affected by this targeted attention.</p><h3> Focusing on your target market allows you to grow beyond it</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t satisfy everyone, and trying to make a product which addresses every need means creating a brand strategy that&rsquo;s so generalized that it&rsquo;s diffuse and useless. But if you focus on solving one set of needs and doing so exceptionally well, you&rsquo;ll build a solid foundation and strong near-term growth.</p><h3> Brand differentiation is how you provide exceptional service to the people who get &ndash; and give &ndash; the most value</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s an ongoing process, and one that savvy companies continually revisit, recalibrate, and refine.

It refers to the technology that is becoming increasingly important in the world of financial services, and is beginning to disrupt the way business operates. FinTech can include everything from mobile banking to modern compliance to digital investment advisory.</p><p> According to Accenture, global investment in financial services technology ventures has more than tripled during the last five years &ndash; from under $930 million in 2008 to more than 2.97 billion in 2013. The number of investments in FinTech is increasing year-over-year at an unbelievable rate. The growth of investment in FinTech signifies how technology and the Internet are changing the nature of financial services. From the ways that people pay their bills, to the way they use the Internet to invest their money.</p><h3> So, what are some of the things that FinTech can accomplish for the general public? <br/>  </h3><li> Educate consumers to make smarter financial decisions</li><li> Digital investment advisory</li><li> Mobile payment</li><li> Provide compliance assistance</li><li> Enhance online shopping experience</li><li> Offer new avenues for loans</li><li> Speed payments</li><li> Investment management</li><li> Bank Technology</li><li> Protect assets from fraud</li><li> Crowd funding</li><li> Trading <br/>  </li><p> In this article, we will focus on digital investment advisory and what this means for traditional financial service institutions and advisory firms.</p><h3> What does the #FinTech disruption mean for Financial Advisors?</h3><p> <br/> The rise of FinTech is particularly significant for traditional financial service brands.   We are seeing a rise of new companies offering technology-based programs that provide a complete suite of financial services and investment advice &ndash; also known as robo-advisors. This had lead to many questioning, why pay to see a Financial Advisor when you can get financial advice online for a fraction of the price?  And, why not question it? These platforms offer many sophisticated tools at a third or less of the price of a Financial Advisor.</p><p> Financial Institutions and Advisors need to ask themselves, what is in it for the client? Where can a Financial Advisor make the customer experience and human touch worth going with a traditional Advisor over a robo-advisor? With the #FinTech disruption in full swing, the online presence of Financial Enterprises and its Advisors has never been so important.</p><p> One of the best ways for traditional financial service companies to beat the robo-advisors is through developing an effective online presence and client experience.</p><h3> The Future Investors</h3><p> <br/> Almost 80 million Millennials will stand to inherit $30 trillion in personal wealth and grow their earnings in the coming years. Financial institutions and Advisors that are digital savvy will be the ones to thrive and this is evident in research conducted by Fidelity. Fidelity&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/institutional-investment-management/emerging-affluent-search-for-an-advisor-online\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research  </a> </u>  confirms that emerging affluent investors are nearly twice as likely as millionaires to find a new Financial Advisor through Internet research and more likely than millionaires to find a new advisor through social media.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/institutional-investment-management/emerging-affluent-search-for-an-advisor-online\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fidelity&rsquo;s research  </a> </u>  also finds that 58 percent of emerging affluent investors have a significantly more positive impression of financial advisors who have a good website (key word here is good.

{"original_id":4054,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and the Bottom Line","link":"emotional-intelligence-eq-and-the-bottom-line","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Kyle Woodward</p><h3> Employees may have major disruptive arguments at work because they can&rsquo;t get along with co-workers.</h3>Your accounts receivable administrator is backed up due to planning the family <u> <a href=\"http://www.developingcapablechildren.com/resources/Reducing%20Stress%20During%20Summer%20Vacation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  vacation </a></u>. A foreman calls in sick because of marital issues. An account manager spends most of his day telling everyone he sees about his child&rsquo;s&rsquo; college search process. In life, and in business or at work, there are ups and downs, growth cycles and recessions, good days and bad days. If each day were predictable, life would be extremely dull and boring. How we interact with others and how people handle themselves under a variety of circumstances is what truly puts the spice in everyday life. It&rsquo;s the smile you get from a stranger while in line at the grocery store, a cranky complaint from a neighbor, an announcement that a new family member is on the way, or the news that someone you love has been in an accident.<h3> The amount these interruptions or distractions detract from your company&rsquo;s bottom line is arguably enormous, but also nearly immeasurable.</h3>I would theorize that the productivity LOST in the US annually from work/life distraction probably exceeds some developed nation&rsquo;s total GDP. How can we combat this? What can be done to improve our productive time at work for our business units?Practicing and teaching soft skills help employees develop their <u> emotional competence</u>. Emotional competence allows individuals to appropriately deal with life events, but continue to be focused on personal and company objectives. Helping people stay engaged in their personal goals and missions is how we can attempt to recover these lost hours and dollars of productivity. Simply put, the less distraction, the higher the productivity. The better your employees cope, the more you get accomplished from day to day. In addition, you&rsquo;ll have reduced turnover of staff, fewer on the job accidents, and less sick days taken, just to name a few, all further contributing to your firm&rsquo;s bottom line.No matter what business we are in, what our company provides, how big or small our family is, there are always challenging dynamics. Take for example my employee Ted. Ted is a veteran of the industry but new to our firm. In an industry with a very large paper trail like financial services, having your paperwork done correctly can be an important task. It can make the client you&rsquo;re working with a complete pleasure to serve, or it can turn your day into a nightmare. It&rsquo;s safe to say that paperwork is not Ted&rsquo;s forte. He should have an assistant, but his revenues aren&rsquo;t yet to the point where he&rsquo;s ready to take that leap. His applications take longer than expected to be processed. He is sometimes missing needed forms or signatures from clients. It takes multiple visits to complete the sales process for certain clients when it shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary. Ted sometimes loses clients, their business, and his confidence in our team and company. It seems twice weekly Frank and I are snuffing out nuclear reactions from the home office.Teaching Ted soft skills and polishing up his <u> emotional competence</u> has minimized problems and potential issues with both Ted and our team. He&rsquo;ll only outwardly vent around his issues to me in private. Ted doesn&rsquo;t discuss paperwork problems with newer impressionable employees, unless he&rsquo;s helping them avoid an issue he sees them walking into. He&rsquo;s come to understand there will be frustrations and difficult policies from time to time in a highly regulated environment. He&rsquo;s apologized for inappropriate comments he&rsquo;s made along the way. Ted still gets his blood flowing weekly, but the fallout is no longer detrimental.<h3> Here are a few examples of how to teach soft skills to your employees:</h3>Provide employees an article for review on <u> emotional competence</u> &ndash; discuss at your next luncheon meeting.<li> <strong>  Set aside time in the agenda of a regular meeting to review client interactions </strong> , business ethics, or etiquette issues.</li><li> <strong>  Set up an off site meeting to review goals or plan out a campaign. </strong> While there review the basics of conflict resolution.</li><li> <strong>  Post around the office a list of office &ldquo;norms&rdquo; </strong> &ndash; Regularly expected behaviors that should be followed by your team.</li><li> <strong>  Give on the spot feedback </strong> , in private, if things get out of hand with staff, for any reason.</li><li> <strong>  Praise an employee for exemplary behavior with a weekly blurb in the newsletter </strong> or at the job site.</li><h3> The most important prescription for soft skills training is a healthy dose of  <u>  leadership </u>  by example.</h3>Don&rsquo;t over-react. Communicate regularly about delegates&rsquo; performance and goals. Mentor others and train them appropriately. Try not to micromanage. Listen and understand employee issues. By setting the right tone from the top and surrounding yourself with good people &ndash; you&rsquo;ll recover some of that lost time and productivity. Good people will constantly develop and grow their <u> emotional competence</u> in a contagious manner when on a team or project. The environment will stabilize, less <u> <a href=\"http://www.mindrecipes.com/2009/what-worries-you-masters-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  stress </a></u> will surface, and your bottom line results will follow.","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-27 16:58:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-27 16:58:07.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_OiDPXGS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/emotional-intelligence-eq-and-the-bottom-line/\", \"post_id\": \"8869\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-27 16:58:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-27 16:58:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"emotional-intelligence-eq-and-the-bottom-line\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8868\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4210\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Emotional-Intelligence-EQ-and-the-Bottom-Line.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1275\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454000400,"author_id":46,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4055,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Conference Experience ROI: 4 Tips to Get Started","link":"conference-experience-roi-4-tips-to-get-started","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Conferences are a great way for financial advisors to hear about best practices from thought-leaders </strong> , learn about the latest products and services available, and stay connected with peers and engaged with the industry. It can also be a significant investment of your time and money. With that in mind, whether it&rsquo;s 3-day national conference or a 3-hour local meeting, here are 4 tips to help you maximize you return-on-investment (ROI):</p><h3> Tip #1: Create your own agenda</h3><p> <br/> The event organizer will undoubtedly provide you with an agenda, but will you have your own agenda? Start your own personalized agenda by setting clear and achievable goals; What do want you to gain from the conference? Who do you want to meet? What do you want to learn and can you receive CE credits? Make a schedule ahead of time and account for every hour of the day&hellip;and night. And be sure to take advantage of social/networking events, workshops, and other extra-circular activities offered.</p><h3> Tip #2: Engage with the conference community</h3><p> <br/> In the weeks leading up to the event, let others know that you&rsquo;ll be attending through your LinkedIn update and follow the event on Twitter to engage with the community. Find out if colleagues or clients will be attending and exchange ideas on what they&rsquo;re plans are. Regularly check the conference website for any last minute news, session additions /cancellations or updates. Proactively planning and connecting before the event will give you a big head-start for when you arrive.</p><h3> Tip # 3: Be on your &ldquo;A&rdquo; game</h3><p> <br/> OK, it&rsquo;s the first day of the conference; this is where the rubber meets the road. Pace yourself by planning for early mornings and late nights. Take a few moments at the start of the day to know where you&rsquo;re going by reviewing the directory/map to orient yourself with the session rooms, food areas, and restrooms. If it&rsquo;s a local event, give yourself enough drive time to get there early. You may miss out on some prime networking opportunities that often occur at the beginning of the meeting.</p><p> When it comes to the sessions, be nimble. If a session is not what you expected, move on to an alternate session.  And remember to take notes after each session and create takeaway follow-up actions from each session.</p><p> Keep an your ears and eyes open at all times for opportunities and meet new people - some of your best connections can be made on the coffee line.</p><h3> Tip # 4: It&rsquo;s all in the follow-up</h3><p> <br/> The conference may be over but, for those who want to make the most of the opportunity, your work has just begun. When you get back to the office, reply to the post conference survey and let management know what worked&hellip;and what didn&rsquo;t. Be prepared to share with your colleagues what you learned and the value of the conference. For the more adventurous, you might even want to write a blog post for your website to share the experience with others.</p><p> And most important, keep up the momentum by following-up with everyone you met as soon as you return to the office.</p><p> I hope these tips have helped you. Now go and have a great conference experience!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-27 17:02:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-27 17:02:50.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_pSugjRD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/conference-experience-roi-4-tips-to-get-started/\", \"post_id\": \"8871\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-27 17:02:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-27 17:02:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"conference-experience-roi-4-tips-to-get-started\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8870\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4211\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Conference-Experience-ROI-4-Tips-to-Get-Started.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"540\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453987800,"author_id":62,"chart_url":""}

Do you think outside of the box to think outside of the box?</h3><p> <br/> When you're designing or redesigning your customer experience, it's critical to listen to - and understand - your customers, what they are trying to do, and how well it's going. (And then act on what you hear and let them know what you've done.)</p><p> I  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/07/the-many-voices-of-customer-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recently wrote  </a> </u>  about the many voices of customer experience, all important to total customer understanding. Those voices come from customers, partners, employees, and customers through employees. Additional, less familiar voices are those of the business (financial and operational data and metrics) and of the market (brand and competitive data).</p><p> A couple weeks ago, I came across a book by Wayne C. Burkan titled  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wide-Angle-Vision-Competition-Competitors-Customers/dp/0471134163/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436414363&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=wide+angle+vision#reader_0471134163\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wide-Angle Vision: Beat Your Competition by Focusing on Fringe Competitors, Lost Customers, and Rogue Employees  </a> </u> . It's on my reading list, and I hope to get to it in the coming weeks, but he poses an interesting idea: to break out of your shell, to break away from the herd (mentality), to get out of the rut your business may be in, to innovate and to succeed, you need to listen to those on the edge.</p><h3> What does that mean?</h3><p> <br/> He says every company has a mainstream and an edge. Your mainstream consists of your established customers, best employees, and biggest competitors. Success is defined by growing your customer base and having competitors imitate what you're doing. The mainstream is all about today. He defines the edge as those who see the world through a different lens and are dissatisfied with today's solutions. They're not better or smarter; they just have different needs. They're not trying to be difficult; they're only trying to solve their own problems.</p><p> I think we're all pretty clear on what's mainstream and which voices would fall into that category: they'd be the ones I've already mentioned above.</p><h3> But what about the edge? </h3><p> <br/> Burkan says the following are classified as the edge: lost customers, rogue employees, fringe competitors, and fringe suppliers: he claims they are your best source of information to drive innovation.</p><p> Let's step away from the book for a minute, and I'll give you my thoughts on each of these voices. </p><h3> Voice 1: Lost Customers</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Let's start with lost customers. </strong> They fall into three buckets: (1) complaining customers are those who might be lost customers eventually because you cannot - or can no longer - meet their evolving needs or solve their problems; they complain because they hope to influence product decisions or enhancements, not to be difficult; (2) those who were customers and left because they gave up on you; and (3) those who were prospects but selected a competitor because you couldn't quite meet all of their needs.</p><p> Lost customers from any one of these buckets are good for identifying where the market may be headed because they came to you for something they liked but then you weren't (or were no longer) able to solve their problems or meet their growing, emerging needs. It's important to capture their feedback and track all of their enhancements, requests, and needs that you can't currently meet, as some day they will become their expectations - whether you deliver them or someone else does. Perhaps they are lost customers because you just aren't prepared to meet their needs today, but if you listen, you'll be able to figure out where your products need to be sooner rather than later.</p><h3> Voice 2: Fringe Competitors</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The crazy thing about competitors is that everyone wants to be like them. </strong> We think that we're losing customers to competitors because they're doing something innovative or cool that we should be doing. Maybe. But maybe they're listening to all of their customers, all of the voices. Maybe they're doing a great job of understanding their needs, today's needs along with emerging trends.</p><p> Fringe competitors are made; they are not born. Remember those lost and complaining customers? These fringe competitor companies were created as a result of them - because they couldn't find a solution with those mainstream companies. So, fringe competitors were created by you, in a sense. They had a better idea or a better solution.</p><h3> Voice 3: Rogue Employees</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Burkan states that rogue employees have two traits: </strong> (1) they are opposed to - or question - everything (policies, procedures, plans, etc.), and (2) they are never team players. They see things differently, but they see them clearly and can't understand why others don't/can't.</p><p> We know that employees are (often) your best source of information and ideas. It's worthwhile to listen to all employees, even those that are misunderstood. While their viewpoints may be different, their ideas challenge a system that often needs to be challenged. Why do we continue to do things this way? \"This is how we've always done it\" is not an acceptable response to rogue employees. They are rebels with a cause; they buck the system and question the status quo because they know there's a better way. They may not always be right (and probably often aren't), but if we don't listen to them, we'll never know.</p><p> They may infuse some fresh thinking, and that's not a bad thing. Don't stifle or squash new ideas just because they aren't what \"you usually do.\" Stop the trend of the blind leading the blind. Get out of the rut and start asking some serious questions. Listen to your rogue employees.</p><h3> Voice 4: Fringe Suppliers</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Many companies select strategic partners or preferred providers as a way to secure price breaks and other relationship benefits. </strong> These partners often are (or become) no more than extensions of the company, a mirror of what the company already does and believes in - dare I say, \"yes men\" who lack creativity and become complacent with the way things are (because, hey, they are getting paid) rather than suggesting better or different solutions.</p><p> Rogue or fringe suppliers or partners often offer different and innovative business approaches and solutions, but because they don't align with your approach are cast out and ignored. I've worked with clients who say they don't want a \"yes man\" as a partner. To them, I say \"Bravo!\" You just really have to mean it; in the end, don't say it if you don't. Some of those same clients also beat me up until I agreed to just say \"yes.\" Not good! Your partners should challenge the status quo and help you identify ways to be better overall. </p><h3> Can these four voices change the shape of your future, the shape of your organization?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  I know you can't listen to everyone. </strong> And some voices drown out others, while others may carry more weight. Just don't be afraid to listen to different voices. If you're stuck in a rut and looking for ways to innovate and grow and be different, have a listen to those on the edge. You might just be surprised by what you hear.</p><p> Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.

Morgan Chase. </strong> The bank also found that the savings fueled consumer spending on non-gas related purchases, which, based on credit and debit card transactions, were higher than previously thought. For every dollar saved, Americans spent roughly $0.80 on other things&mdash;restaurant visits, appliances, new gadgets and more.</p><p> But everyday consumers weren&rsquo;t the only ones who saved big in 2015. Lower fuel prices represented a huge windfall for the airline industry. Delta Air Lines alone netted $5.1 billion in savings. As a whole, U.S. carriers retained between 50 and 75 percent of fuel cost savings, says Credit Suisse, and with crude oil at 13-year lows, they can expect to hang on to a similar percentage this year.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/lower-oil-prices-huge-windfall-for-airlines-2015-01212016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Lower Oil Prices a Huge Windfall for Airlines in 2015\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/lower-oil-prices-huge-windfall-for-airlines-2015-01212016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> As I mentioned in a previous Frank Talk, cheaper fuel helped the domestic airline industry soar to record profits in 2015. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines are collectively set to post an annual  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/this-industry-is-set-to-post-record-profits-on-lower-fuel-costs/#.Vp_JRSs0PUE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   $33 billion in net profits  </u>  , </a>  up from $17.4 billion in 2014, an increase of almost 90 percent.</p><p> Profits could touch $36 billion this year, the IATA says, resulting in record amounts of free cash flow.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-04-02/COMM-Domestic-Airlines-Are-Forecast-to-See-Greatest-Free-Cash-Flow-in-Years_04022015-LG.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Domestic Airlines are Forecasted to SEe Greatest Free Cash Flow in years\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2015/2015-04-02/COMM-Domestic-Airlines-Are-Forecast-to-See-Greatest-Free-Cash-Flow-in-Years_04022015.gif\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> So the question is: What are airlines doing with it all?</p><h3> Generous Rewards, Attractive Valuations</h3><p> <br/> Besides upgrading their fleets to include more fuel-efficient aircraft, airlines are putting the cash to work by improving balance sheets and rewarding shareholders.</p><p> In 2015, more than $10 billion&mdash;about 7 percent of U.S. airlines&rsquo; market cap&mdash;was returned to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. That&rsquo;s double the amount from 2014. Among the carriers expected to raise their dividends this year are Delta, American Airlines, Alaska Air Group and Southwest Airlines, according to a Barron&rsquo;s article this week. Credit Suisse calls American&rsquo;s $1.5 billion stock buyback program, more than 12 percent of its market cap in 2015, &ldquo;a sign of management confidence of what&rsquo;s to come in 2016.&rdquo;</p><p> Investors are taking notice. Within the industrials sector, airlines are the least expensive, with network carriers (American, Delta, United Airlines, etc.) at 7.1 times earnings and low-cost carriers (Spirit Airlines, JetBlue, Allegiant Air, etc.) at 10.5 times earnings.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/airlines-remain-least-expensive-industrials-sector-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Airlines Remain the Least Expensive in Industrials Sector\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/airlines-remain-least-expensive-industrials-sector.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> A concern some investors might have is rising labor costs, which have overtaken fuel as airlines&rsquo; top expense. (In its World Airline Profit Outlook 2016, the CAPA Centre for Aviation calculates that the industry&rsquo;s fuel expenses came down from 30 percent of revenue in 2014 to 25 percent in 2015. This year, they could fall to as low as 19 percent.) There have been reports that pilots, flight attendants, ground crew and other personnel are seeking higher wages and salaries as company profits climb.</p><p> These additional costs, if approved, could be offset by not only lower-for-longer fuel prices but also growing ancillary revenue&mdash;non-ticket fees for checked-in baggage, priority seating, in-flight meals and the like&mdash;and more disciplined capex spending.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t expect airfares to drop dramatically, however. As far as anyone can tell, they&rsquo;re likely to stay where they currently are. In the second quarter, the average price for a seat fell a slight 2.8 percent year-over-year, from $396 to $385.</p><p> <strong>  That&rsquo;s a little less than the $700 you saved at the pump. </strong></p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-27 17:17:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-27 17:17:17.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_bqPT9X2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-airlines-are-spending-their-record-profits/\", \"post_id\": \"8875\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-27 17:17:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-27 17:17:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-airlines-are-spending-their-record-profits\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8874\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4213\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Airlines-Are-Spending-Their-Record-Profits.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"910\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1453996800,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

The first was an existential panic. &ldquo;Who am I without debt?&rdquo; the 31-year-old asked herself.</h3><p> <br/> Then a grin spread across her face. &ldquo;I started dancing and screaming in my apartment. It was such an amazing moment, and I felt incredibly happy to be done with this,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> Recent college graduates might despair that their day of liberation is far away or might never come.

Being debt-free was not her first priority when she packed up her undergraduate loans and moved from California to New York in 2010 to attend graduate school &ndash; a decision that would more than triple her total student debt. Paying off her loans required a lot of patience and  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/student-loans-no-house-no-new-car/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sacrifice  </a> </u> , some risk-taking, and brutal self-honesty. She concluded that she couldn&rsquo;t accomplish her financial goal if she pursued a career in the field she had studied in college.</p><h3> She first borrowed $23,000 as an undergraduate to attend California State University, Long Beach, where she majored in theater.</h3><p> <br/> She  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/video-college-borrowers-remorse/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   didn&rsquo;t appreciate  </a> </u>  then how much  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/the-pain-of-paying-student-loans/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   interest can accrue  </a> </u>  on debt and how much it would  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/college-debt-student-stress/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   weigh on her  </a> </u>  in the future. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re definitely in a bubble,&rdquo; she said. After graduating in 2006, she found a job at a Los Angeles non-profit and earned around $35,000. During three years in that job, she paid the minimum on her loans, about $250 per month. She said she thought she couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay more, &ldquo;even though I could&rsquo;ve.&rdquo; She considered, but rejected, setting up an income-based repayment plan, because while it would reduce her payments, the additional interest would pile on more debt.</p><p> When she applied to a graduate school at New York University in 2010, she was vaguely concerned about adding more debt to pay the $52,000 tuition for the one-year theater program. But rather than continue to hammer away at her undergraduate loans, she took on more. &ldquo;I was stubborn and wanted to move to New York and go to my dream school,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> Lockert borrowed an additional $58,000, which would cover her tuition plus $6,000 in books and fees at NYU. To pay her living expenses in Brooklyn and  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/behavior/10-student-loan-prevention-strategies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contain her debt  </a> </u> , she held down three part-time jobs &ndash; as a children&rsquo;s theater teacher, an administrative assistant at NYU, and a receptionist at a ballet school, where she was permitted to do homework.</p><p> In graduate school, Lockert continued paying her undergraduate loans. By the time she graduated from NYU in May 2011, she owed a total of $68,000 on her graduate school and remaining undergraduate loans combined. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I really woke up and thought, &lsquo;I have to get this monkey off my back.&rsquo; &rdquo; She resolved to change her past strategy of making only the minimum loan payments, which had increased to $900 per month for all her loans under a standard repayment plan.</p><h3> But she encountered an obstacle: she couldn&rsquo;t find full-time employment in New York.</h3><p> <br/> After some 30 interviews over a six-month period, and too many weekends missing her boyfriend, she decided to join him in Portland. &ldquo;I felt I&rsquo;d given New York 100 percent, but I had all this debt and could barely pay my rent,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> Portland&rsquo;s job market wasn&rsquo;t as easy to conquer as she&rsquo;d imagined. She found various seasonal or unsatisfying jobs and worked hard to pay about $1,000 per month on her loans. She realized she would have to increase her income to make serious headway on the debt. When she started her financial blog in  <u>  <a href=\"http://deardebt.com/2013/01/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   January 2013  </a> </u> , she said, &ldquo;I was not in a good place. I made the mistake of feeling my net worth influenced my self-worth.&rdquo;</p><p> But writing the blog unexpectedly took her career in a promising new direction. She soon quit the relatively low-paying job she had found &ndash; as an events coordinator &ndash; and took a risky leap to freelance writing for financial companies and websites. The move paid off: her earnings doubled between 2014 and 2015 to about $60,000. Bigger paychecks &ndash; combined with paying only $450 for her half of the apartment rent &ndash; allowed her to accelerate her loan payments to $2,000 a month and eventually $4,000 a month. She finished off her final remaining balance by dipping into her emergency fund for a $1,500 principal payment and reluctantly accepting a $4,000 gift from her mother, who&rsquo;d recently received a generous bonus at work.</p><p> With her debts now paid off, Lockert is eager to start planning for her future and  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/how-much-for-the-401k-depends/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   saving for retirement  </a>  . </u> &ldquo;It took a lot of hard work and dedication so it feels really good to be debt-free,&rdquo; she said.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-27 17:22:26.000000","last_updated":"2021-01-31 19:12:21.236000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_7IvFBNJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-melanie-paid-off-her-student-debt/\", \"post_id\": \"8878\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-27 17:22:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-27 17:22:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-melanie-paid-off-her-student-debt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8876\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4214\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Melanie-Paid-Off-Her-Student-Debt.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"706\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454007600,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4059,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Do You Meet Prospects Online?","link":"how-do-you-meet-prospects-online","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In any given week, I&rsquo;m asked about the prospecting potential in the social space and how do I meet the people <strong>  I want to do business with online? </strong> I feel like the answer should be something magical like unicorns and gnomes, but it comes down to something quite basic: <strong>  I reach out, say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and provide them with something they can use and then&hellip;wait. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  No pixie dust, sorry </strong></h3><p> <br/> It really is that simple. Granted, there is some follow-up after the initial contact, but the foundation of anything I&rsquo;ve ever done online starts with the reach, the greeting and the value-add. I will go into some specifics of what I do and then you can modify for your day-to-day needs.</p><h3> The Reach</h3><p> <br/> I remember when Eminem came out with a song called, &ldquo;My name is&hellip;&rdquo;Regardless if you like his music or not, the song made millions on lyrical genius which started with:</p><h3> HI! MY NAME IS (WHAT?) <br/> MY NAME IS (WHO?) <br/> MY NAME IS <br/> SLIM SHADY <br/> HI! MY NAME IS (HUH?) <br/> MY NAME IS (WHAT?) <br/> MY NAME IS <br/> SLIM SHADY <br/>  </h3><p> You see, when I reach out to a prospect, I really do say, &ldquo;Hi, my name is Sheryl Brown&hellip;&rdquo; and follow the rest with the greeting and value-add based on the context of why I want to know this person better. The most important part of the reach is to be authentic &ndash; meaning, only reach out to someone you really want to do business with, otherwise, leave them alone. It&rsquo;s pretty sacred in the online world; so respect the initial reach.</p><h3> The Greeting</h3><p> <br/> Next, I follow my reach with a greeting which is specific to the person I want to meet. For example, I might say, &ldquo;Hi, my name is Sheryl Brown. I recently had lunch with Sharlene Woerther and she said we should meet.&rdquo; This is also quite basic, but so many people do the reach online (especially LinkedIn!) and never provide context in their greeting. Grr &ndash; these make me crazy because it&rsquo;s lost potential to really connect with someone. Everyone is moving a mile a minute, take the extra 15 seconds and write the personalized greeting. I promise you will connect with more prospects than you ever thought possible.</p><h3> The Value-Add</h3><p> <br/> Last, I follow-up the reach and the greeting with what value-add I can provide. So the same example might then say, &ldquo;Hi, my name is Sheryl Brown. I recently had lunch with Sharlene Woerther and she said we should meet. I provide social media assistance to financial professionals and believe I can help you out with your profile. Look forward to connecting!&rdquo; This allows the recipient of my message to make a thoughtful decision about connecting with me and even the advisors who may not want the help initially usually connect anyway because they might someday want my help.

Educational background? Technical expertise? Top productivity?</h3><p> <br/> The answer is one that continues to elude many managers and organizations, leading to constant turnover, high training costs, and poor performance. Defining &ldquo;high potential&rdquo; then, may well be the first step toward developing the employees most likely to succeed within your organization.</p><p> High potential tends to mean different things for different organizations, but research suggests it refers to the top three to five percent of a company&rsquo;s personnel who both a) consistently outperform their peers across a multitude of metrics and b) most exemplify the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talentguard.com/the-difference-between-core-competencies-and-values/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   organization&rsquo;s values  </a> </u>  and culture. Viewed from within a competency framework, this means a high potential employee is one who best fulfills the core and job-family competencies set by your organization.</p><p> So how do you find and develop high-potential employees in a cost-effective and efficient manner? You use an integrated competency framework to build role profiles and then create assessments that compare internal and external candidates against those profiles. This directly addresses two top talent shortage problems: lack of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talentguard.com/retaining-talented-employees-via-an-integrated-competency-framework/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   technical competencies  </a> </u>  and lack of workplace competencies, two areas that together make up more than half of the reasons companies say they can&rsquo;t fill jobs.</p><p> <strong>  Such an approach also is especially helpful when searching for internal talent to fit an open position &ndash; an elusive match that often appears downright impossible. </strong> Competency-based job profiles help to improve both retention and performance and to reduce hiring costs by ensuring you are hiring from the start the correct people for each position. An integrated talent management system like this also can increase profitability and shareholder returns by as much as 22% according to some studies.</p><p> As you can see, it&rsquo;s easy for your company to move beyond the 54% of organizations that say they can&rsquo;t adequately fill customer&rsquo;s needs because of a lack of qualified talent. It is simply a matter of starting with competencies first, and then finding the employees and candidates who are the best fit. With an integrated competency framework, your organization can do exactly that &ndash; inexpensively, effectively, and quickly.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-27 18:19:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-27 18:19:45.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_1UKDS4m.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/developing-high-potential-employees/\", \"post_id\": \"8881\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-27 18:19:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-27 18:19:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"developing-high-potential-employees\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8880\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4216\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Developing-High-Potential-Employees.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"702\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454011200,"author_id":309,"chart_url":""}

The most amazing freelance economy is at your fingertips. Use it.</li><li> <strong>  Commit to an operating rhythm. </strong> Managing remote staff requires regular, consistent communication. Book a daily 5-10 min check in and a longer debrief at the end of the day.</li><li> <strong>  Scrap email. </strong> It&rsquo;s the worst way to communicate at length with staff. I use an audio app on my phone instead and can tell you how much more productive it&rsquo;s made me.</li><li> <strong>  Get comfortable with online meetings and get a decent setup. </strong> I use Zoom over Skype, but whether you choose that that, GoTo or SuiteBox isn&rsquo;t the important part. Getting the right mic, camera, setting and being adept at using them is.</li><li> <strong>  Pre-book your calendar for the year. </strong> Start with your holidays and work backwards, including the days you&rsquo;ll see clients and the days you won&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re someone who likes structure, you&rsquo;re going to love the afterglow of this one.

{"original_id":4062,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Want Feedback? Here's How To Ask For It.","link":"want-feedback-heres-how-to-ask-for-it","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You find asking for feedback uncomfortable? Yes, it often comes with anxiety but it is an essential part of personal development. When you actively ask for feedback, you learn more and faster. With some preparations, you can really gain useful information for your growth.</p><p> Asking for feedback effectively is a skill that you can learn. It involves preparing the right questions, identifying the right feedback givers, and productive feedback conversations.</p><h3> <strong>  Prepare the Right Questions </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are two types of question:</p><h3> Yes / No questions</h3><p> <br/> With this type of question, one can give a simple yes or no answer. You can use this type of question to quickly confirm an idea, and obtain straight-to-the-point information.</p><p> Here is an example: &ldquo;Do you think it is a good idea?&rdquo;</p><p> You can use this question to evaluate your new idea (e.g. for a product feature). If 10 people say yes and 1 person says no, then the idea is probably worth pursuing.</p><h3> Open-ended questions</h3><p> <br/> This second type of question requires answers that are more more explanatory. You can use it when you need to gather additional information.</p><p> Presuming your manager says that your time management skill could be improved. To understand more, you can raise some questions like the following:</p><li> What exactly do you think was off with my time management skill?</li><li> Why do you think I failed to meet certain deadlines in the last few months?</li><li> What do you suggest me doing to improve?</li><li> What are the steps I can take to prepare for the next project? <br/>  </li><p> A take-away tip: Open-ended questions are great for seeking coaching advice.</p><h3> <strong>  Identify the Right Feedback Givers </strong></h3><p> <br/> The best place to start looking for the right people to ask for feedback is your closest circle, namely your team, your direct managers, friends and family. Find out who has the knowledge and expertise in the area that you are interested in.</p><p> When you find the one, come to see her in person, give her a call or drop her an email. Here is an example for a quick email: &ldquo;Could we please have a chat in the next couple of days because I want your feedback on my new project. When can be a good time for you?&rdquo;</p><p> If you can not find anyone within the first circle, widen your search to your second degree connections. Ask your workmates and friends if they can introduce you to more experienced colleagues. After the introduction, you can approach them to ask for feedback. Give them plenty of time and notice so they can prepare.</p><p> Depending on what you want to ask, you can ask for feedback from more than one person. Feedback from different sources gives you more perspectives and helps you form a more rounded view (like in 360 degree feedback). You can use  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.impraise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Impraise  </a> </u>  to ask for feedback from many people at once without a hassle.</p><h3> <strong>  Productive Feedback Conversations  </strong></h3><p> <br/> You want feedback conversations flow naturally and comfortably. That is the best way to gain the information you need and maintain a good relationship with the givers. Here are some steps you can follow in order to have productive feedback sessions.</p><h3> Thank givers for their time</h3><p> <br/> Show your appreciation when others spend time on giving you their opinion and advice. Your gratitude would also encourage people to give you more feedback in the future.</p><h3> Ask your first question specifically</h3><p> <br/> Be as specific as possible in your first question. It is helpful to include n actual context for a giver to refer to, like last month's project. When you want feedback on a certain skill, be as specific as possible. Asking for feedback about how you tell stories is more specific than doing so with your general communication skills, for example.</p><p> This is a specific first question: &ldquo;How did I improve in telling stories in the last two months?\"</p><h3> Listen attentively</h3><p> <br/> You are listening to a perspective, which might be different to yours. Make sure you listen carefully so you understand what is actually said, not just what resonates with your own perceptions.</p><h3> Ask clarifying and collaborating questions</h3><p> <br/> Use the questions that ask for more details or background information. They are a great tool to confirm your understanding and widen the search for more coaching advice.</p><h3> Take notes</h3><p> <br/> It is a good practice to keep notes of the feedback you received so you can come back to it in the future. Treat the notes like a commitment with yourself to change and improve.</p><h3> Thank for their opinions</h3><p> <br/> Whether you agree or disagree with the feedback givers&rsquo; opinion, thank them for sharing their insight with you.</p><h3> Commit and follow up</h3><p> <br/> You want the givers to know that you do not take their time and effort lightly. Make a commitment to get back to them later regarding the matter. When you have created some changes using their feedback, let them know.</p><p> For example, a week or a month later, you notice improvements, you can send them a message like this one:</p><p> &ldquo;Thank you for the advice. I changed my approach like you recommended and the results have been very promising. Cheers for the help.&rdquo;</p><p> While asking for feedback, you will notice that not all steps are needed in a single session. However, you should make sure that there are three elements of gratitude, clarification and commitment in receiving other people&rsquo;s feedback.</p><h3> <strong>  In brief </strong></h3><p> <br/> Asking for feedback is beneficial to your personal development. Actively reaching out for advice, you learn faster and smarter. Ask yourself what you want that feedback can help you with, so you can prepare the specific questions that lead to such information. Then you need to seek out the people who might have knowledge, within your circle of connections. Finally, conduct productive feedback conversations with gratitude, clarification and commitment.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-27 19:05:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-27 19:05:12.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_w1zN4k4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-feedback-heres-how-to-ask-for-it/\", \"post_id\": \"8884\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-27 19:05:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-27 19:05:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-feedback-heres-how-to-ask-for-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8882\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4218\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Advisors-Who-Do-More-With-Less.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"423\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454012100,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4063,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Understanding Life Insurance Policy Loans","link":"understanding-life-insurance-policy-loans","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Taking Loans Against a Life Insurance Policy.</h3><p> <br/> There are many different types of permanent life insurance policies that offer a cash value component &ndash; and because of this, one way for these policy holders to access cash quickly can be to borrow funds from the cash value.</p><p> In some cases, the policy holder can borrow policy loans on life insurance up to 90 percent of the total amount of cash that is in the policy.</p><p> But, while this can provide you with an easily accessible and inexpensive way to obtain funds quickly, it could have an effect on the amount of money that the beneficiary receives at a time they need it the most. So, it is important to be careful when borrowing from a cash value life insurance policy. Taking loans against life insurance policy can lapse a policy too, if not done in the proper manner. Your agent can help with this decision.</p><p> There are other potential items to consider as well. Like are  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/blog/life-insurance-retirement-plans/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   life insurance policy loans taxable  </a> </u> ? And the life insurance policy loan interest rates a company will charge.</p><h3> Considerations When Borrowing From Your Life Insurance Policy.</h3><p> <br/> When borrowing policy loans on life insurance or funds from a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/life-insurance/cash-value/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cash value life insurance policy  </a> </u> , the loan is not considered to be a distribution. It is also not considered to be income to the individual. This is because the amount that is borrowed will eventually be required to be paid back.</p><p> On top of the pay back amount, the borrower will also be required to pay at least a small amount of interest on the amount that is borrowed. Therefore, taxes are typically not due on life insurance policy loans.</p><p> If, however, the failure of the policy holder to repay the loan amount leads to either the lapse or cancellation of the policy, then there will be some tax implications. In this case, since the cash value of the policy would technically be used to repay the loan, then the amount that is paid will then be considered as income to the policy holder. In addition, any additional funds that are distributed upon the surrender of the life insurance policy would also be considered as income.</p><p> Also, if a life insurance policy were to lapse because the policy holder stopped paying premiums or they borrowed too much from the policy, the loan from the policy could be treated as being forgiven by the IRS.</p><p> A forgiven life insurance policy loan means that the loan is actually no longer considered to be a loan and is not required to be paid back. Thus, forgiven policy loans will be treated as ordinary income and are then subject to taxes.</p><p> Therefore, when a policy holder lapses their life insurance policy due to policy loans, they will also increase their gross income. This is due to the fact that the loans are then considered to be forgiven. Any loan that is in excess of the total amount of premiums that were paid into the policy is considered as part of the policy holder&rsquo;s gross income after the policy lapses.</p><p> When an individual increases their gross income, then they technically are also increasing their tax liability. Because life insurance is taxed as ordinary income, then the policy holder&rsquo;s overall tax rate may also increase on their regular income.</p><h3> Why Borrow From Your Life Insurance Cash Value?</h3><p> <br/> Aside from the tax considerations and the potentially lower amount of death benefit, there could actually be some viable reasons to consider borrowing from your life insurance policy&rsquo;s cash value.</p><p> For instance, the funds that are borrowed from these plans are typically otherwise considered to be tax free.

{"original_id":4065,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Empathy: The Groundwork for Building Lasting Relationships","link":"empathy-the-groundwork-for-building-lasting-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The &ldquo;and so it goes&rdquo; phenomenon of going back to school that was so prevalent when school started again this year reminded me of how important milestones are to the people experiencing them, and why we need to cultivate empathy in all of our relationships (especially during those milestones). Perhaps you&rsquo;re a parent sending a child off to a new school or college, an employer welcoming a new employee, or even a salesperson nurturing a prospect through a difficult decision-making process. In any type of relationship, the ability to empathize with what the other person is going through is critical.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Be Too Busy to Listen</h3><p> <br/> Remember how scary it was to enter middle school when you were a kid? Especially if you just moved to the area and didn&rsquo;t know anyone? That&rsquo;s perhaps one of our earliest angst-ridden moments entering adulthood. Moving from a one-classroom environment to a multi-classroom schedule is a big deal. The rules shift. More is expected of us. It&rsquo;s stressful!</p><p> Our lives are super-busy today, but it&rsquo;s still up to us as parents and school officials (who were once children) to remember that anxiety and help guide our children through it. Looking back, did your parents take the time to listen to you and address your fears before, during and after the transition? How did you feel about that at the time? Parents who take time to think about transitions from their children&rsquo;s point of view, to listen to them and to encourage open dialogue tend to enjoy a rich relationship with their children all their lives. If you let yourself be &ldquo;too busy to listen,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re robbing yourself and your child of something precious&mdash;the relationship glue that holds close-knit families together.</p><h3> Walk That Mile in Their Shoes</h3><p> <br/> Just as empathizing with our children is important, practicing empathy in business is just as critical to the function of any organization. Leaders&mdash;remember where you were early in your career, and take pains to ease employees into your systems and minimize their discomfort. Does that mean you need to coddle people? Nope. They&rsquo;re adults. But they still need time to navigate your landscape and learn what&rsquo;s expected of them. You&rsquo;ve been there, but many times we get so caught up in where we are right now that we forget to think about how it feels to be the new kid on the block.</p><p> Take a look at HR and other employee-facing aspects of your business from a new-hire perspective. How can you make their transition from newbie to highly functioning employee a smooth one? If you don&rsquo;t have a mentoring system, start one. Didn&rsquo;t you feel more comfortable when someone took you under their wing?</p><p> Listening and putting on someone else&rsquo;s shoes helps build that relationship glue, and it works the same way in the business environment as it does in personal life. People are people whether they&rsquo;re family members, employees, vendors, partners or peers.</p><p> Empathy also helps at the negotiating table. Good negotiators do their homework by finding out as much as possible about the needs and wants of those on the opposite side of the table. When your team members look at the negotiating process from the adversary&rsquo;s view of the world, it helps them position your solution as a best fit, and sets them up for growing a long-term relationship once the contract is won.</p><h3> #JustBeNice Goes a Long Way</h3><p> <br/> Listening, looking at things from another person&rsquo;s perspective, letting them know you understand them and are willing to help&mdash;all of these are facets of empathy that need consistent practice. Some people seem to find it easier to develop empathy than others, but it all comes down to one thing: being good to people. Keep doing it and you&rsquo;ll get better at it!</p><p> I&rsquo;ve often said that relationships are like muscle tissue, the more they are engaged, the stronger and more valuable they become. Developing empathy is an important component in helping build those relationship muscles. Practicing its facets improves all walks of life, and should be on everyone&rsquo;s exercise list.</p><p> This was first posted on  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 17:21:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 17:21:25.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_lqhcko3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/empathy-the-groundwork-for-building-lasting-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"8889\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 17:21:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 17:21:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"empathy-the-groundwork-for-building-lasting-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8887\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4221\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Best-Secret-to-Managing-Up.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"310\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454086800,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

On top of that,  <u>  <a href=\"http://mavsocial.com/how-to-use-linkedin-to-generate-b2b-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   more than 80 percent  </a> </u>  of B2B leads gathered via all social media efforts combined come from LinkedIn.LinkedIn currently has more than  <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/274050/quarterly-numbers-of-linkedin-members/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   396 million users  </u>  , </a>  but how can your business take advantage of the platform to earn more leads?Here are 8 ideas you can try to get more traction and generate more leads using LinkedIn.</p><h3> 1. Share Updates Regularly</h3>A good way to appear on your connections&rsquo; news feed on a regular basis and stay top-of mind is to update regularly. Not only are you putting out good information, sharing industry news and tips, but people are able to see that you frequently post. This allows those who view your feed to see your engagement on a regular basis.Start today by sharing an industry tip, a work-related thought or a link to a recent article you read.<h3> 2. Publish a Post</h3>It might seem obvious but just the act of posting to social media helps you to establish credibility and gain new connections, especially when you <u> <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/open-linkedin-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  publish to LinkedIn Pulse </a></u>. Rather than just sharing news or an interesting article, adding your own thoughts or publishing an original article on LinkedIn will get you noticed.Think of a post on LinkedIn like a blog post, only written on LinkedIn rather than your company website. If you&rsquo;ve thought of writing a blog to share tips, you might consider posting to LinkedIn. You can also re-publish what you write for your website on LinkedIn Pulse.<h3> 3. Create a Slideshare</h3>Like publishing a post, you&rsquo;re creating content that potential customers can consume. In fact, more than 70 million people are actively looking for content every month on SlideShare, a way to both share your slideshows and also to share information contained within them. It&rsquo;s a resource ready-made for generating leads and connecting potential customers with content they can use every day.<h3> 4. Participate in LinkedIn Groups</h3>Roughly <u> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2014/09/25/4-best-practices-for-generating-more-leads-on-linkedin/\" target=\"_blank\">  2.1 million groups </a></u> currently exist on LinkedIn and if you&rsquo;re looking for quality leads, <u> <a href=\"https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1164/~/groups---getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">  joining relevant groups </a></u> is a great place to get start. When selecting LinkedIn groups, opt for those with the highest activity level.Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a group, do your best to be helpful by commenting on others&rsquo; posts where you have expertise. Answering questions and engaging in discussions establishes authority, builds trust, and brings leads right to you.Related resources on LinkedIn Groups:<li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/using-linkedin-industry-groups-like-a-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   10 Minutes To Posting and Responding to LinkedIn Industry Groups Like a Pro  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/linkedin-industry-groups-b2b-lead-generation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5-Step Prep for Making the Most of LinkedIn Industry Groups For B2B Lead Generation  </a> </u></li><h3> 5. Reach Out With InMail</h3>One of LinkedIn&rsquo;s most popular marketing features is <u> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/static?key=about_inmail\" target=\"_blank\">  InMail </a></u>, which is useful for lead generation because it allows you to send messages to people outside of your direct connections.InMail is also an effective tool for getting past gatekeepers and making personal contact with prospects. Plus, according to LinkedIn, marketers who use InMail are 30 times more likely to obtain a response than those who choose cold calling.Tip: Before you write an InMail message to a contact, research them and find commonalities you can mention in your message.<h3> 6. Utilize Advanced Search</h3>For <u> <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/linkedin-strategies-b2b-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  B2Bs using LinkedIn </a></u> to generate leads, advanced search is an effective tool. Advanced search lets you enter details such as companies, names, or alma maters to connect with leads through more-focused results.You can quickly create a contact list of people that meet a set of criteria that you can later reach out to via email or LinkedIn InMail.<h3> 7. Make Use of Sponsored Updates</h3>In 2013, LinkedIn conducted a <u> <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/marketing-solutions/global/en_US/site/subsites/content-marketing/pdf/LIAdobeCaseStudy7-22-13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  case study </a></u> on Adobe Systems Inc. As part of a company growth plan, Adobe used LinkedIn&rsquo;s Sponsored Updates and quickly found that decision makers who had viewed the updates were &ldquo;79 percent more likely to agree that &lsquo;Adobe can help me optimize my media spend.'&rdquo;The downside of sponsored updates is that they cost you every time someone clicks. The upside is reaching a new audience. Because LinkedIn users who aren&rsquo;t direct connections see Sponsored Updates, they&rsquo;re an effective way to maximize your reach and produce new leads.<h3> 8. Optimize Your Company Description</h3>One of the most underrated tools on LinkedIn is the description on your company page. You should use this space to address your target audience directly and help to make sure the focus is on the first two sentences, which is what LinkedIn displays before the &ldquo;see more&rdquo; button. Try highlighting your value proposition or even feature a call to action that encourages following or to visit a section of your profile.When it comes to B2B lead generation, LinkedIn is an important resource. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find these eight ideas helpful and try one or more.

{"original_id":4067,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Land Your Dream Job","link":"how-to-land-your-dream-job-2","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Job interviews. They&rsquo;re a necessary evil, yes? We need the job, this is part of the process to getting it. It&rsquo;s crazy scary because everything depends on this conversation with strangers who are going to make a decision about your life. The stakes are high. You absolutely need to nail your job interview.This is so important that we need to be completely prepared. One of my &ldquo;jokes&rdquo; is that we go through many years of schooling, we gain onsite experience and then we get to a job interview and we&rsquo;re nervous as heck and stammering all over the place! Drawing a blank. Losing sleep in advance.</p><h3> Here are 13 steps to getting you absolutely ready to nail your job interview &amp; land your dream job. <h3>  <br/>  <strong>   1. Do Your Due Diligence about the Firm  </strong>  <br/>    </h3></h3><p> Get all the facts about the firm that you can. Know the directors and other key players. Know their clients and the projects they&rsquo;re working on. Get to know their mission statement. Also, know the job you&rsquo;re applying for. This way you&rsquo;ll appear to be educated about the firm. They&rsquo;ll love that. And think about the reaction if they discover you don&rsquo;t know important information about the firm! That&rsquo;s not going to help you nail your job interview!</p><h3> <strong>  2. Dress For Success </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Wear the clothes that are appropriate for the job itself but step it up a notch. If your job requires that you wear a suit, wear a suit, but add a pocket square and some great shoes.</p><p> If you want to nail your job interview, your attire will make an impression. People don&rsquo;t always analyze specifically what you&rsquo;re wearing but the impression they get is subconscious. It&rsquo;ll help you to fit in even before you&rsquo;ve gotten the job.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Roleplay the Answers to Questions </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> We know many of the questions that interviewers may ask us. For example, &ldquo;What are your strengths &amp; what are your weaknesses?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are you leaving your current job?&rdquo; &ldquo;Were there any difficulties you&rsquo;ve faced &amp; how did you deal with them?&rdquo; etc. etc. There may be you-specific questions that you&rsquo;re concerned about. Perhaps you were fired from your last job &amp; you need to explain. Or maybe you have a few years unaccounted for on your resume. These are stories that you need to prepare.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Don&rsquo;t Be Afraid of Your Recorder. It is Your BFF. </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The only way to nail your job interview is to be super-prepared. First, think about the questions the interviewer may ask you. Think about the ones you&rsquo;re afraid she&rsquo;ll ask you. You know, &ldquo;Why is there a blank spot for 6 months?&rdquo; (I was traveling around south Asia)</p><p> Then, answer these questions into a recorder. Next listen to your answers and revise them in a written format. You&rsquo;ll likely be making your answers a bit shorter &amp; more concise. Think of just the important facts and remove the superfluous words &amp; phrases. Next, read the answers aloud into a recorder again. And finally record the answers to the questions off-the-cuff again.</p><p> This will invariably improve your off-the-cuff answers by at least 50%. Conservative estimate. And if you do it 5 or 6 times you&rsquo;ll be nearly perfect. you don&rsquo;t need to be perfect perfect! People want to hire humans.</p><p> I do a lot of interview practice with my clients. Just yesterday a client asked if you should just keep talking and leave no pauses. I was appalled! He said he had a professor who told him to just keep talking and to avoid pauses. That&rsquo;s what inspired me to write this post. Read on &amp; you&rsquo;ll see what I mean about pauses.</p><p> Also, I want you to really understand and master why this firm should hire you. Record yourself. When you hear something you don&rsquo;t like it means that you have a weakness regarding that concept. Think about it and work on it. Even if they don&rsquo;t ask you this specific question make a point of letting them know why they  should  hire you.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Be Relaxed </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> You need to get rid of tension in your body &amp; specifically in your vocal mechanism. Do relaxation exercises and make &ldquo;being relaxed&rdquo; a habit in your life. We walk around with tension manifested in our musculature from the stresses of everyday life. Job interviews make people even more tense. We literally tighten our vocal mechanisms. This results in a pitch that&rsquo;s too high and a voice that&rsquo;s very thin-completely devoid of executive presence.</p><p> That tension also unfortunately makes people talk too fast, forget what they wanted to say, sound super choppy and use closed body language. (I could kinda go on, but you get it.) The tension that we feel before &amp; during job interviews can cause our skill level to drop.</p><p> What happens as a result of this tension and our skill levels dropping &amp; talking too fast, etc. is that people don&rsquo;t see how amazing you are. The real you isn&rsquo;t showing! You can&rsquo;t have your interviewers not seeing how amazing you are. Not if you want to land your dream job.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Be Early </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t just be on time. Be early. Get to the waiting area &amp; check in with the receptionist. You can use this time to do your abdominal breathing exercises. Also, use the time to do your relaxation exercises. Employers want to hire people who are early. If you plan to be on time anything can happen (traffic, accidents, subway is slow&hellip;) &amp; you may be late. No one wants to hire someone who&rsquo;s late for the job interview.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Your Speech &amp; Voice can Make or Break You </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Use lots of air when you speak. Practice with a recorder-you&rsquo;ll be surprised at how you sound so authoritative, yet warm. (That&rsquo;s the name of the game.) Speech is acoustically air molecules that vibrate. It&rsquo;s science. The more air you use the more resonance you have thus the more authoritative you sound.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Just Replace Your Filler Words with Pauses. </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Use pauses. I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough. Pauses give you a chance to take a breath (which provides your brain with oxygen!) And remember this: when you&rsquo;re speaking too fast &amp; without pauses the interviewer can&rsquo;t keep up. You&rsquo;re in the future, your listeners are in the past. Taking a breath keeps everyone in the present.</p><p> Make sure the end of your utterances are short in duration and quiet in volume. This eliminates &ldquo;upspeak&rdquo; and drag.&rdquo; Drag is little known and oft used. It&rsquo;s when a speaker lengthens their last syllable in a phrase or sentence.</p><p> Be concise. When you keep your concepts light &amp; clean it helps the interviewer to understand your message. If you already practiced my first tip you&rsquo;ll have this nailed already. BEing concise results in your listeners understanding your message to a fare-thee-well.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Master Your Small Talk </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Small talk is anything but small. Most people are afraid of it or despise it. That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re doing it wrong. You can learn to use small talk to instantly create very strong bonds with others.</p><p> I arm my clients with an arsenal of anecdotes. But you can do this yourself. You just master some stories that get others thinking and talking. Did you ever hear someone tell a story &amp; you instantly wanted to tell the story that it made you think of? That person is likely a great story-teller.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t be afraid of your arsenal of anecdotes. Once you have practiced using them a bit you won&rsquo;t need them anymore. You&rsquo;ll be able to make relationship building small talk as a habit in your life.</p><p> Use this technique to get others to relate to you. Keep your stories super short but really engaging.</p><h3> <strong>  10. Use Warm &amp; Open Body Language </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure you sit with your back straight, your arms apart &amp; your head held high. Sit at the back of your chair. This will not only make the interviewers instinctively trust &amp; like you but it will cause you to feel more confident. It&rsquo;s science.</p><p> When I was in 11th grade I was so excited to go to the amusement park at the end of the year. I looked forward to it the entire school year. My friends &amp; I were there, having a great time &amp; decided to get our picture taken as we were going down a roller coaster. The photographer said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your head down, keep your head up! People put their head down when they&rsquo;re afraid and we won&rsquo;t be able to see you in the pic.&rdquo; Well wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, I couldn&rsquo;t keep my head up! I physically had no control over my head! My friends were so mad that I had ruined the picture!</p><h3> <strong>  11. Your Body Can Control You or You Can Control it. </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> On that roller coaster my fear controlled my body. I knew I needed to keep my head up but I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Obviously I needed to do my relaxation exercises.</p><p> It took a few roller coaster rides to get my head to stay up, but when I did I was really able to enjoy the ride.</p><p> I had an amazing female c-suite client who was often in a board room with only men. She was aware that she was really quite nervous. The first thing we did was train her to relax in that room. That included her body language. She initially was unable to sit at the back of her chair! She sat at the edge of her seat. It took a couple of weeks to get her at the back of the chair. But when she did she had so much more control over her body, her speech &amp; the others in the room. She became a leader.</p><p> So remember, don&rsquo;t cross your legs or your arms. Keep your extremities as far from midline as possible. This results in your being able to keep control of yourself, your speech &amp; other people. That&rsquo;s leadership.</p><h3> <strong>  12. Listen </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Always be open to hearing what your interviewers are really saying. When you&rsquo;re not ultra clear as to what they&rsquo;ve said, do repeat what you think they said in different language. (Not A different language &mdash; that would be show-offy! just using different words.:) This show&rsquo;s them that you&rsquo;re thoughtful, thorough &amp; not impulsive.</p><p> Take a beat to process their questions before answering. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of silence. What may seem like an eternity to you is probably just a second. This gives you the opportunity to design your answer concisely &amp; with persuasion. The sooner you start speaking the greater the chance that you&rsquo;ll use fillers, run on sentences and really big no-content words. The ones I call grammar glue (ands, ifs &amp; buts.)</p><p> Leave some air space for them to react to what you&rsquo;ve said. All this is part of the recipe for you to nail your job interview!</p><h3> <strong>  13. Have Intelligent Questions Prepared </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> How stupid do you feel when the interviewer says, &ldquo;Do you have any questions for me?&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re all, &ldquo;No, not right now; I&rsquo;ll email you if I think of any&hellip;&rdquo; If you want to nail your job interview you should have questions prepared.</p><p> Another article from Monster has some  <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/nine-questions-to-ask-interview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  questions you can ask during an interview </a> . I think a few of them are a bit obnoxious &amp; could be toned down. Just use them as examples to help you in your specific job quest. This results in your interviewers seeing that you&rsquo;re really interested and the right person for the job.</p><h3> <strong>  Nail Your Job Interview </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> This is the perfect job for you. You need it! Yes, a bit of preparation &amp; discipline for something that&rsquo;s going to change your life is beyond worth it.</p><p> Remember once you do the work for the first few interviews from now &mdash; it&rsquo;s totally done! You won&rsquo;t have to do that much at all. The way I&rsquo;ve described it is the way to make these things a habit in your life. Not only will it change your life but it&rsquo;s going to make your life amazing! :)</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2017-07-04 15:00:03.000000","last_updated":"2017-07-04 15:00:03.000000","image_url":"2017/7/article_placeholder.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-land-your-dream-job-2/\", \"post_id\": \"21117\", \"post_date\": \"2017-07-04 15:00:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2017-07-04 15:00:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-land-your-dream-job-2\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"21116\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"10000\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/how-land-your-dream-job.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"845\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/personal-development/how-to-avoid-perils-commiserating/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2016-10-21\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/09/stop-marketing-build-relationships-influencers/\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"57\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"inheritance-3-steps-to-handle-the-details\", \"enclosure\": \"http://www.radiofreehpc.com/audio/RF-HPC_Episodes/Episode103/RFHPC103BlockchainTechnology.mp3\\n25964928\\naudio/mpeg\", \"_oembed_94e8ca1f71729152af05e98ea2951d45\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_37287a5bf2a3f70ec8c7b86d78383d22\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_0e0b0183863791c621dfe8c998aded1d\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_oembed_460a144c50a017741d7d3e3446a7dcde\": \"{{unknown}}\", \"_wpas_done_all\": \"1\", \"wpcf-homeslideroption\": \"1\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1499263200,"author_id":202,"chart_url":""}

Extremely confident, radiant with optimism, and knows she&rsquo;s got it all together.</h3><p> <br/> She&rsquo;s fierce, fearless, and female, in total control of her life, her money, and her decisions. Hope is not a strategy for her. Not ever. She&rsquo;s intentional about her goals and plans for the future, but at the same token, she&rsquo;s enough of a realist to know when to course correct or make a major change necessary for own personal growth. </p><h3> How do I define this financially fearless woman?</h3><p> <br/> The financially fearless woman knows who she is and where she&rsquo;s going. Who is she? Not some mythical, clip arty business women wearing a red cape, superimposed on top of steep, snowy mountain. On the contrary. She&rsquo;s you. And she is many of the women you already know.</p><p> Being financially fearless does not mean you have to be an expert in investments, finance, or economics but it does mean that you possess a certain mindset and characteristics that exemplify investors in this category. Recently, I identified many of these attributes on a multi-speaker web presentation entitled &ldquo;Women, Wealth and Empowerment&rdquo; sponsored by Chaikin Analytics and optionMonster&reg; with six other female financial professionals including Sandy Chaikin, host of the Financially Fearless podcast (I was her first guest). The webinar succeeded in its goal to empower women to take control of their financial future and invest with confidence, simply and easily.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-28-at-10.03.39-AM-2.png\" width=\"1193\"/></p><p> You can watch the entire webcast with  <u>  all #Fearless7 here </u>  or access my presentation above. You&rsquo;ll soon discover that financially fearless woman share many of the same characteristics, among them:</p><li> <strong>  She invests in herself. </strong> It was billionaire investor Warren Buffet who said, &ldquo;Invest in as much of yourself as you can. You are your own biggest asset by far.&rdquo; The financially fearless woman is bullish on her own identity and success. She makes the biggest investment in her own professional development and education, realizing the gains and return on investment will be immeasurable.</li><li> <strong>  She is involved in making financial decisions. </strong> Financially fearless women share in the financial decisions of their household rather than let others make decisions exclusively. Making decisions in this fashion fosters open communication and a commitment to results. The likelihood of achievement is also enhanced when decisions are made jointly.</li><li> <strong>  She stays informed.  </strong> Keeping abreast of the economy and business news put financially fearless women at an advantage. They understand what is going on in the markets and how that may impact their own financial position, without overacting. They also make decisions from a position of strength.</li><li> <strong>  She doesn&rsquo;t make excuses. </strong> Financially fearless women don&rsquo;t play the blame game when things don&rsquo;t go their way. Instead, they take full responsibility and accountability for their decisions, good and bad.</li><li> <strong>  She knows her credit score. </strong>  The financially fearless woman knows her credit score and how the quality of that score affects the rate of interest she can borrow money. Maximizing her credit worthiness is a priority and affects her bottom line.</li><li> <strong>  She knows what she owns. </strong> Financially fearless women understand what assets they own, the ownership structure of those same assets, and constraints.  <u>  Related Financial Self-Defense for Women Part 2 </u>  Some assets, like real estate, have less liquidity than cash. Assets on a balance sheet are not the same as cash in the bank.</li><li> <strong>  She controls her debt. </strong>  Her debt does not control her. The financially fearless woman knows exactly what she owes, to who, and the interest rate attached to that debt service. She is making more than just the minimum payment and using credit for convenience.</li><li> <strong>  She&rsquo;s got goals.  </strong> The financially fearless woman has committed her goals to writing, quarterly. She puts these goals into SMART format &ndash; Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-Sensitive, and knows that she has to take action for their achievement.  <u>  Related Goals Cheat Sheet for the Uninspired </u> . Rather than trying to accomplish too many things all at once, she is clear about her priorities.</li><li> <strong>  She has an emergency fund. </strong>  Having at least 6 months of living expenses in the bank is essential to the financial fearless woman. She is partially insulated against an unexpected event, such as a loss of job, a medical emergency, or a family crisis, giving her enough of a cushion to ride the storm.</li><li> <strong>  She is investing for the future.  </strong> The financially fearless woman knows there are only two ways to make money: by going to work and/or by putting your money to work. Inflation, the increase in prices of goods and services affects the purchasing power of what we can buy for those same dollars. Not to mention, there is a finite amount of energy and time each of us have. The financially fearless woman invests her money so she can work smarter not harder.</li><p> So quit trying to make it harder than it is. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 18:08:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 18:08:10.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_zjgVZVR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-financially-fearless-woman/\", \"post_id\": \"8895\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 18:08:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 18:08:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-financially-fearless-woman\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8892\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4224\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Land-Your-Dream-Job.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1235\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454065200,"author_id":485,"chart_url":""}

People will type in keywords related to their topic of interest and review results based on their rank. Make your content do some of the work for you by ensuring it is keyword rich, has the appropriate title and description. Also, don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of media coverage. Consider linking back to these articles to boost your search rankings!</li><li> <strong>  Tailor your content according to your consumer&rsquo;s buy-cycle:  </strong> Use insights that you know engage your prospects and clients at each stage of their buying cycle so you&rsquo;re serving up quality and relevant content that guides them from brand awareness to commitment to purchase.

You may not enjoy editing your own work, but it&rsquo;s an essential part of the writing process. These five simple, yet effective, self-editing techniques will make your writing cleaner, more concise and easier to read. Plus, they&rsquo;ll save your editor some work.</p><h3> 1. Break up long sentences</h3><p> <br/> Try to keep your sentences under 30 words, especially when you&rsquo;re writing for the web.

Delete unnecessary words</h3><p> <br/> Some good examples of this are &ldquo;in order to,&rdquo; &ldquo;really,&rdquo; &ldquo;very&rdquo; and other filler words that don&rsquo;t add to your sentence. Get into the habit of automatically searching for these words and deleting them. Then, take another look at your document to make sure you haven&rsquo;t used two or more words when one would do.</p><p> Before: It is really difficult to come up with an example of an overly long sentence when you are not used to writing that way.

Keep a dictionary close by</h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s a not-so-secret secret most professional editors will admit to: they don&rsquo;t know how to spell every word in the dictionary. What they do know is when to look things up. They also know that spellcheck isn&rsquo;t always reliable. Keep a dictionary on your desk as you&rsquo;re editing your own work, and look up anything you&rsquo;re not sure of.</p><p> There&rsquo;s much more a professional editor can do to make your work more polished and professional.

I&rsquo;m not alone in this unwitting-self-sabotage, I&rsquo;ve talked to hundreds of impressive people who have privately shared that they too shepherd themselves from perceived dangers lurking about.  But that&rsquo;s the thing, isn&rsquo;t it?  What we perceive and what is real are two very different things.</p><h3> What we perceive and what is real are two very different things.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m reminded of those old cartoons where the main character would have an angel perched on one shoulder and the devil on the other.  &ldquo;Come on, go for it.  What?  Are you CHICKEN??!!&rdquo;, the devil would whisper.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him,&rdquo; the angel would reply, wanting to keep us safe, &ldquo;make the right choice.&rdquo;</p><p> But it seems to me that neither the angel nor the devil knew what they were talking about.  As the right choice isn&rsquo;t as simple as &ldquo;do-this-don&rsquo;t-do-that&rdquo; &ndash; for the truth is, there&rsquo;s possible peril in either direction.</p><p> The right choice isn&rsquo;t as simple as &ldquo;do-this-don&rsquo;t-do-that&rdquo; &ndash; for the truth is, there&rsquo;s possible peril in either direction.</p><p> One of the things we live and die by in the theatre is that &ldquo;playing it safe is the most dangerous thing you can do&rdquo;.  When you&rsquo;re standing on stage with an audience filled with people expecting something magical, you feel pretty darn vulnerable and the stakes feel pretty darn high.  The natural tendency is to hide, to mask the vulnerable part of ourselves off from the world so that we can&rsquo;t be hurt.  But the problem is, a safe performance is usually a boring performance, or a bad performance, and a safe performer an unemployed performer.  For you see, hide the vulnerability and you lose truth.  It&rsquo;s in the vulnerability that lies the magic.</p><h3> Hide the vulnerability and you lose truth.  It&rsquo;s in the vulnerability that lies the magic.</h3><p> <br/> And I think this is true in life as well.  To simply &ldquo;go for it&rdquo; feels terrifying, but the alternative &ndash; whether we see it or not &ndash; is just as perilous.  For playing it safe in life puts us in danger of losing ourselves.  Of losing our truth.  And that&rsquo;s wherein lies the magic.</p><p> So if neither the angel or the devil have the answers, if all directions point to peril, what is one to do?</p><p> I know.  This is where a quick-fix would be great (and chocolate is but a momentary distraction &ndash; I&rsquo;ve tried).  If I could just be like so many out there and give you the 7-steps to the solution of life, I&rsquo;d probably be rich and famous.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t feel very honest.  For as much as we hate to hear it, there is no quick-fix.  There is no painless or easy solution.  There&rsquo;s just moving forward.</p><p> As much as we hate to hear it, there is no quick-fix.

{"original_id":4072,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Art of Gaining Referrals from Clients","link":"the-art-of-gaining-referrals-from-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There&rsquo;s an ocean of new business out there this year!  <br/> <strong>  Are you &ldquo;fishing where the fish are&rdquo;? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mark Magnacca is one of my all-time favorite best-selling authors in the financial services and sales industries. One of the key points he&rsquo;s made in his books and seminars, is the importance of fishing where the fish are. While you are prospecting or asking for referrals, are you going to the best location to attract the type of clients you really want to do business with?</p><p> When I prospected and cold-called during my days as a wholesaler, I found it exciting to call on a prospect I&rsquo;d never met and do my best to establish enough rapport to persuade them to become a client. My winning percentage was very good because I asked about their business, listened for gaps I might fill with our product line and followed up as promised.</p><h3> Asking for a personal introduction</h3><p> <br/> One day during a coaching session with Mark Magnacca, I learned about asking for referrals from my top clients. I was like most of the financial advisors that I called on and did business with. We knew that referrals were important to the growth of our business, but didn&rsquo;t have a referral strategy and did not want to bother our good clients for referrals. Mark asked about my relationship with my top producers, especially with my Top 20 percent. The Top 20 percent were the advisors that generated eighty percent of my revenue. I&rsquo;m sure you know about the 80/20 Rule aka The Pareto Principle. I did too, but I didn&rsquo;t practice it. Most of the advisors I worked with didn&rsquo;t practice it either. Mark and I talked about the 80/20 Rule and the importance of a Referral Strategy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just ask for a referral&rdquo; he advised me. &ldquo;Ask for a personal introduction, either in person or by phone.&rdquo; That was it!!  That was the &ldquo;AHA&rdquo; moment that made a huge difference in my business! My best clients trusted me, knew the value I added as a business-building consultant and raved about me every time they could. From that day on, I NEVER cold-called on a prospect again. Each appointment was the result of a &ldquo;warm, personal introduction&rdquo; from a top client to one of their friends or business associates. To get back to the fishing analogy, instead of fishing with one hook at a time, I felt like I had cast a net to catch schools of fish. It was really that easy and so much more fun and less time-consuming!</p><p> Are you &ldquo;partnering&rdquo; with your better clients and contacts? I know we are all told to work hard ~ but learning how to work smarter makes our efforts so much more rewarding! The best question I asked my best clients is this: &ldquo;Who else do you know whom I can help the way I&rsquo;ve helped you increase your business or revenue?&rdquo;  If your relationship is truly solid, they&rsquo;ll gladly help you with referrals. But remember, you want to get a personal introduction. Years ago, when you asked someone for a referral, they would give you a name and phone number and suggest you mention their name when you called. That strategy worked fine but a personal introduction to a referral works so much better. When I learned about personal introductions, I tried it at an office I visited regularly in New England. When I asked for a referral, the advisor said, &ldquo;Sure, go see Steve in the other corner office. He&rsquo;s a great guy, million-dollar producer and has known me for twenty years. Just tell him I sent you over to say hello.&rdquo; Then I asked if he would invite him to lunch with us that afternoon and introduce me then. Of course he agreed to and by the end of lunch, I had a new client.  Yes, it&rsquo;s as easy as that!  </p><h3> Applying the 80/20 Rule to my business</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s revisit the 80/20 Rule I mentioned earlier in this article. The Pareto Principle, courtesy of Vilfredo Pareto, an economist in the early 1900s states The 80/20 Rule means that in any set of things (workers, customers, etc.) a few (20 percent) are vital and many (80 percent) are considered trivial. In Pareto's case, he found that roughly 20 percent of the people in his country dominated with 80 percent of the wealth. 20 percent of product defects causing 80 percent of product problems.  It&rsquo;s well known by Project Managers that 20 percent of work (usually the first 10 percent and the last 10 percent) consume eighty-percent of the time and resources. You can apply the 80/20 Rule to almost anything, from the science of management to the sciences of the physical world around us. I&rsquo;ve studied this Rule in depth and found fascinating results. Eighty-percent of the time, the majority of people wear the same twenty-percent of their clothes from their closet. Eighty percent of the car accidents are caused by the same twenty percent of the population. It&rsquo;s really fascinating how this 80/20 Rule applies to so many things in life, but especially valuable for business people like us.</p><h3> Hiring a Business Coach</h3><p> <br/> I hired a business coach twenty years ago when I was a workaholic and burning the candle at both ends. When I explained why I was working seven days a week, he asked about my schedule, the clients I focused on and how much prospecting I was doing for new clients. He also asked me to describe my Top 20 percent, how I gained them as clients, their demographics as well as their psychographics. Before I even considered running a report, I replied that most of my best clients were gained at my luncheon meetings and were approximately 30 years old. Oh boy, was I completely wrong!!</p><p> That week, I ran the report for my Top 20 percent and was blown away by what I found. The vast majority of my Top 20 percent advisors were NOT gained by luncheon meetings in the offices I called on as a wholesaler. They were referrals and personal introductions from many of my most successful financial advisors. Most of them were &ldquo;corner office&rdquo; advisors with a great work ethic, military or athletic background, family oriented and between 35-55 years old. The other AHA moment I had was the realization that they DID produce 80 (eighty) percent of my revenue and rarely asked for anything from me, such as seminar support, golf balls or free meals. The smaller producers that did very little business with me on a relative scale were the ones that constantly asked me for financial support, freebies, trinkets and other things that typical wholesalers handed out. They were more of a pain in the butt than business partners.</p><p> So, here is my challenge to you. Just for giggles, run your 80/20 report on your book of business. Know exactly which clients are in your top twenty-percent, generating eighty-percent of your revenue. Then dive deeper into their personalities, how you gained them as clients, what you have in common, how often you contact them. Then dive even deeper. Just how well do you know them? What are their interests, hobbies, favorite activities and favorite vacation locations? Where or if they went to college? Do they have favorite sports teams? How many kids and grandkids do they have? Have you met them? What&rsquo;s their favorite restaurant? How much do you REALLY know about your top 20 percent?  I was so embarrassed when I looked at my Top 20 percent report and could not answer most of these questions about them. I had known some of these clients for ten years! I immediately created a twenty- question fact sheet, that I gradually completed over the next three months as I met with each of those clients within my top twenty percent. THEN, I really knew my clients and all the things we had in common and the important matters in their life.</p><h3> My relationships were an inch deep in a book of business that was a mile wide.</h3><p> <br/> Previously, my relationships were an inch deep in a book of business that was a mile wide. After I shared more time with my best clients and got to know them much better, my relationships were a mile deep in a book not so wide anymore. I gave my C and D clients to someone else, because I didn&rsquo;t have the time to give them what they needed. I&rsquo;ve only met a small percentage of advisors that have given clients away to another advisor or hired a younger advisor to work on the C and D clients. They need attention also, but probably not worth your time at the moment. I want you to realize something that&rsquo;s very important. You cannot be everything to everyone who has done business with you. But, you can be everything and the Go-To advisor to your Top 20 percent. These are the clients that will give you excellent referrals and more enjoyment in your career.</p><p> Try it, and share your success stories with me!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 18:41:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 18:41:47.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Qbex3BQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-art-of-gaining-referrals-from-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"8903\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 18:41:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 18:41:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-art-of-gaining-referrals-from-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8902\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4228\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Art-of-Gaining-Referrals-from-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"820\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454122800,"author_id":362,"chart_url":""}

and online.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure most of you know who Elon is but, just in case, he was one of the founding team of PayPal who, after eBay bought the firm, went on to create the world&rsquo;s most successful electric car brand, Tesla, as well as other visionary activities around space travel with SpaceX, solar power with SolarCity, and replacing high speed trains with the hyperloop transport system.</p><p> You can watch the whole interview if you want (see end of blog entry), but I&rsquo;d suggest missing the first 20 minutes or so, as it was just a discussion about Tesla cars.</p><p> That&rsquo;s important for Hong Kong as the country is the largest Tesla car market in the world where 2,221 Model S sedans were sold in 2015, making the electric car the top-selling sedan in Hong Kong.</p><h3> However, talking Tesla was not as illuminating as much as the second half, when Elon expanded some thoughts around technology, space travel and more. <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\"

below:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-28-at-10.50.39-AM-2.png\" width=\"449\"/></p><p> Although I was

So many of us have been tempted by now to throw in the towel and quit. Many of us have.It&rsquo;s easy to make resolutions when the calendar says we should think about doing that. But how do we know we are truly ready to make a significant change?<h3> <strong>  Are You Ready for a Big Change in Your Life? Answer These Questions to Find Out. </strong></h3><h3> Are You Going Through a Life Upheaval?</h3>If you are experiencing an upheaval in your life, be it professional or personal, it is an opportunity for you to learn more about yourself. You can capitalize on the upheaval in one of two ways: learn while doing more of the same or take a new path. If you are having inklings that your need to find a new way, it is good to trust those instincts. A major life upheaval is nothing more than an invitation for growth while setting new strategies into place to make life what you want it to be.<h3> Are You Tired of Merely Surviving?</h3>Going to work, paying the bills and living day-to-day can get extremely frustrating, especially if you think there is more waiting for you. If you think this is you, you are probably ready for a change in your life.<h3> Are You Bored?</h3>We all get bored from time to time. But if you are experiencing boredom on a regular basis, it might be your heart and your mind begging you for a change in your life.Lynn A. Robinson, M.Ed., is one of America&rsquo;s leading experts on the topic of intuition. She has said, &ldquo;Boredom is one of those messages from your intuition that change is needed. It&rsquo;s a signal that your energy is being drained and that something new needs to happen.&rdquo;<h3> Do You Have Specific Goals?</h3>A sign that says you are probably ready to change your life is that you have clearly identified your goals. You&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this lately and you know you have goals.So what are they? Do you have a personal interest you&rsquo;d like to pursue? Are you looking to start a new career? Are you hoping to gain more skills? Are you wanting to start a small business? If you know what you want to achieve, then half the battle is already won.Get some advice, research online, or choose a short course to introduce yourself to a network of people who might be able to inspire you and help you. If you have already identified your goals, then this is a sure sign that you are ready for a big change in your life.Sources:<a href=\"http://liveboldandbloom.com/06/lifestyle/are-you-ready-to-change-your-life-10-ways-to-know-for-sure\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://liveboldandbloom.com/06/lifestyle/are-you-ready-to-change-your-life-10-ways-to-know-for-sure</a><a href=\"http://www.stevenaitchison.co.uk/blog/6-signs-youre-ready-to-change-your-life-for-the-better/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.stevenaitchison.co.uk/blog/6-signs-youre-ready-to-change-your-life-for-the-better/</a><a href=\"https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/blog/2014/01/08/5-signs-you-are-ready-to-change-your-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://blog.opencolleges.edu.au/2014/01/08/5-signs-you-are-ready-to-change-your-life/</a><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lamisha-serfwalls/7-signs-youre-ready-for-a-major-life-change_b_7225108.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lamisha-serfwalls/7-signs-youre-ready-for-a-major-life-change_b_7225108.html</a>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 21:31:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 21:31:34.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_CEADSoU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-ready-for-a-big-change-in-your-life/\", \"post_id\": \"8909\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 21:31:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 21:31:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-ready-for-a-big-change-in-your-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8902\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4230\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Art-of-Gaining-Referrals-from-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"553\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454069700,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

He has worked in his present job for just 1-1/2 years.</h3><p> <br/> One day Pat meets with his boss, the VP of Marketing, in his boss&rsquo;s office. Pat begins to discuss ideas he has for creating greater awareness of the company on the Internet, specifically through a social media campaign on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other venues. Pat presents a brief plan on paper. It&rsquo;s nothing too complex, just some bullet points. Pat&rsquo;s boss scans the document, clears his throat, and grumbles, <strong>  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rest of the plan? Where are your projections for return on investment? I don&rsquo;t see anything about the upfront investment of time and materials. Who is going to execute the plan, monitor it? Huh?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> With each question, Pat&rsquo;s eyes grow wider, his face redder. His boss&rsquo;s lips stretch into what&rsquo;s best described as a sh!%-eating grin, as if to say, &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re so freakin&rsquo; smart with your new technology, let me see what you do with this!&rdquo;</p><p> Pat maintains composure, as well as any first-job-out-of-college employee could do. Pushed to his limits, he finally says, <strong>  &ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; </strong> and turns to exit. Just before he leaves, he blurts, <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in your job sooner than you think!&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Amazingly, this is a true story and more common than you think. Resentment and disrespect between members of the same team, verbally expressed or not, are being felt more and more throughout the &ldquo;halls&rdquo; of corporate America. Can you say, &ldquo;Business as Usual?&rdquo;</p><h3> There is a clear generation gap within the American workforce.</h3><p> <br/> We have &ldquo;baby-boomers&rdquo; whose levels/ positions within their companies are generally nearer the top of the food chain, and we have subsequent generations&mdash;&rdquo;X,&rdquo; &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; &ldquo;Z,&rdquo; &ldquo;Millennial&rdquo;&mdash;rounding out the rest of the hierarchy.</p><p> Time is not on the side of baby-boomers, many of whom will find themselves on the outs unless they can adapt to conducting business not as they would have it, but as the changing economic landscape dictates. It&rsquo;s simple. For businesses to grow, the people within them must grow as well (including older team members). They must first acknowledge a need to modify behavior, and then seek the tools and developmental aids necessary. Those unable to adapt will be designated &ldquo;dinosaurs,&rdquo; extinct and out-of-touch. Their self-confidence and self-worth will drop, further diminishing their contributions.</p><p> As leaders and business owners, perhaps it&rsquo;s time for you to help these older workers&mdash;and in turn ALL of your workers regardless of age or years of service&mdash;help you.</p><p> Here are some ideas on how to begin narrowing the generation gap between workers in your organization. Think of it as investing in both the present and the future&mdash;as a way to get your entire company culture up-to-date and aligned.</p><p> <strong>  1. Let&rsquo;s assume your company has issued smart-phones to most employees, especially those in management/leadership positions. </strong> Congratulations! Now, does everyone know how to use this technology to its maximum potential? Probably not.</p><li> Offer classes to staff on how to use their smart phones and other devices (such as iPads). Develop these classes internally; invest in your company!</li><li> Engage younger generation workers by having them put together a program that teaches &ldquo;dinosaurs&rdquo; how to use such tools effectively. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Create &ldquo;Mentoring&rdquo; programs for both younger and older generation workers. </strong></p><li> Have experienced employees lead/guide your newer employees, fostering a sense of continuity and legacy.</li><li> Have younger &ldquo;whipper-snappers&rdquo; lead/guide the &ldquo;dinosaurs&rdquo; through the maze of today&rsquo;s technology, lingo, and social networking sites, helping overcome their fears of embracing all things new. <br/>  </li><h3> The talent pool of workers is shrinking. <br/>  </h3><p> To perpetuate your success and remain profitable, you need to retain those employees who got you where you are and whom you believe will get you where you want to go. Those able to adapt and willing to learn (including you!) will want to stay. Those who think Pat&rsquo;s boss was an awesome dude will need to make another choice.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t always be the one who determines who stays and who goes. Create a workplace environment where people, regardless of their generation, want to grow and learn.</p><p> It&rsquo;s your choice . . .</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 21:37:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 21:37:59.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_BTaT2x2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/narrow-the-generation-gap-to-create-greater-profitability/\", \"post_id\": \"8911\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 21:37:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 21:37:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"narrow-the-generation-gap-to-create-greater-profitability\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8910\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4231\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Narrow-the-Generation-Gap-to-Create-Greater-Profitability_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"858\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454079600,"author_id":458,"chart_url":""}

Tossing and turning, getting up for a drink of water (or to pee, or to read a text), or being awoken by an uncomfortable temperature (whether it be to throw the blankets off in a sweaty rage or shiver into another pair of socks), are all common nightly occurrences.</p><p> You will know when your body is running on a half-tank: Insufficient sleep for a short time may make you more irritable and moody.</p><h3> Moreover, the long-term effects of sleep deprivation are serious: insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiac problems, to name a few.</h3><p> <br/> Sure, during the week things pop up at work that push your gym session back, which means you have a dinner date with your DVR at 10 p.m., but you can catch up on the weekends. Right? Sorry to break it to you, but sleeping until noon on Saturday does not build up a sleep bank you can borrow from come Monday. You cannot make up for lost sleep&mdash;that makes it important to aim for at least seven hours of sleep every night.</p><p> Since you can&rsquo;t always control the early morning meetings, 10 p.m. season finales, or weeknight happy hours that somehow leave you stumbling into a diner at 2 a.m., it&rsquo;s time to focus on small changes you can make to your daily routine that will help facilitate better sleep quantity and quality.</p><li> <strong>  Take the TV out of the bedroom. </strong>  Finish your Netflix marathon in the living room, and then head to bed. Televisions are a major cause of insufficient sleep. The blue light, which suppresses melatonin production, and stimulating nature of some programs make falling asleep difficult. Even worse, many that cannot stay asleep turn it back on in the middle of the night. Some of you may be able to sleep through a tornado&mdash;the dull buzz of early a.m. infomercials will not wake the beast. But if you&rsquo;re someone who has trouble sleeping, computers, video games, and anything else that shines a bright light into the retina is going to take whatever melatonin your body is beginning to produce at night and destroy it.</li><li> <strong>  Make the bedroom a no-work zone. </strong>  Your bedroom is made for two things only: sleep and sex. Once your mind is trained otherwise, it makes it difficult to sleep. Resolve that you will not bring work related material or thoughts into the bedroom. Who knows, your sleep quality and your sex life may see a boost.</li><li> <strong>  <strong>   Learn to trigger your relaxation response.  </strong>    </strong> When you&rsquo;re running around all day like a chicken with its head cut off&mdash;hit the gym, chug smoothie on way to work, last-minute presentation, scarf down lunch on way to meeting&mdash;you can&rsquo;t expect the stress to magically disappear the minute your head hits the pillow. That is why it is important to teach your body to calm down by eliciting the relaxation response, either by practicing it during the day or before bedtime. There are many ways to elicit this calming response&mdash;progressive muscle relaxation; meditation and abdominal breathing&mdash;which is the antithesis of the stress response that so many of us unfortunately experience in the bedroom. If you practice these techniques, many studies have demonstrated that your sleep will improve. In fact, I incorporate it, as do many sleep specialists, into my insomnia therapy.</li><li> <strong>  Exercise at least 30 minutes, five days per week. </strong>  If new year&rsquo;s resolutions and the holiday 15 haven&rsquo;t convinced you it&rsquo;s time to hit the gym, maybe this will: Exercise increases the levels of a neurotransmitter BDNP (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which decreases anxiety levels and promotes better equality sleep. Plus, if you exercise outside during the day, especially in the morning, exposure to sunlight strengthens your circadian rhythms making it easier to sleep at night.</li><li> <strong>  Upgrade your mattress. </strong>  Ever think it may be what you are lying on that is to blame for all of that tossing and turning? If it&rsquo;s over five years old, it may be time for a new one. If you suffer with aches and pains in bed maybe it&rsquo;s time to get rid of that box spring and consider one of the newer sleep number or memory foam mattresses.</li><li> <strong>  Set a sleep-wake schedule. </strong>  Even on weekends and days off (which we know is easier said than done). One of the more common mistakes people make is to skimp on sleep during the workweek and then try to catch up on weekends. It does not work. Cognitive problems that arise from insufficient sleep are not reversed by the extra sleep, and you throw your circadian clock off by sleeping in. Because you slept until noon on Saturday, you will be wide-awake Sunday night&mdash;but that alarm clock is still ringing at six, and so the cycle continues.</li><li> <strong>  Skip the afternoon coffee break. </strong>  When that mid-afternoon slump hits, reach for a healthy snack or glass of water instead of the espresso, which may be the reason you are have a hard time falling, and staying, asleep. What you might not realize is that the caffeine you have become so dependent on has become the cause of your sleep problems. If you are consuming more than two cups of coffee daily and especially after noon, you might want to consider that it may no longer be the solution but is now the problem. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough of a buzzkill, chocolate contains caffeine, too.</li>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 21:55:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 21:55:26.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_LCqUidR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-lifestyle-changes-that-will-improve-sleep-quality-and-quantity/\", \"post_id\": \"8915\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 21:55:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 21:55:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-lifestyle-changes-that-will-improve-sleep-quality-and-quantity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8914\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4233\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7-Lifestyle-Changes-That-Will-Improve-Sleep-Quality-and-Quantity.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"688\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454097600,"author_id":157,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4078,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"35 Ways of Thinking That Every Young Entrepreneur Needs to Adopt","link":"35-ways-of-thinking-that-every-young-entrepreneur-needs-to-adopt","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a young farm boy with the dream of becoming an entrepreneur I knew that I needed to learn to think like an entrepreneur to make up for my lack of experience and formal education. In this article I share the 35 ways of thinking that every young entrepreneur needs to adopt in order to be successful.</p><h3> An entrepreneur doesn&rsquo;t need a business degree in order to be successful but there is a certain mindset every entrepreneur must cultivate to be able to start, lead and grow their business successfully. </h3><p> <br/> Mindset is the major determining factor of success in every walk of life. The thinking patterns you habitually adopt largely determine the actions you take every day and therefore ultimately the results you finally achieve.</p><p> Not all wantrepreneurs understand the dramatic mindset shifts that are needed to go from student or employee to becoming an entrepreneur. Without the right mindset, success in business is highly unlikely.</p><p> As an entrepreneur, you will face new challenges every day. You will find yourself on uncharted territory where there is very little research or data for you to make a sound decision. This is where your gut feeling will come in, and all entrepreneurs must learn to follow their gut instinct.</p><p> <strong>  1. The buck stops with you. </strong>  It goes without saying that your success as an entrepreneur is determined by the decisions you make. Entrepreneurs have the ability to create something from nothing in a way that can have a major impact on their community, industry or even the world. This means making a lot of big decisions about what must be done and how. The mindset of an entrepreneur accepts full responsibility for every decision they make.</p><p> <strong>  2. Think short and long-term at the same time. </strong>  When you work for an employer you are mainly responsible for ensuring that what needs to be done now, is done. As an entrepreneur, you have to project your mind forward, thinking about the potential opportunities and pitfalls that lie around the corner. Mainly, you must make decisions without having all the facts. The mindset of an entrepreneur is simultaneously dealing with the present and planning for the future.</p><p> <strong>  3. Blow up the box.  </strong> Employees spend their time thinking &lsquo;inside the box&rsquo;. As an entrepreneur, there is no box. In fact, if you do find a box, your first inclination is to destroy it. You see opportunities that others don&rsquo;t, you try new ideas that others are afraid to, and you take risks that others wouldn't dare to. This requires courage, persistence and the determination to keep going despite criticism,  rejection and skepticism.</p><p> <strong>  4. Do what needs to be done. </strong>  Employees have job descriptions that require a specific set of skills. New entrepreneurs must learn a host of new skills even if they have the funds to outsource certain things. Unless you know what needs to be done, you can easily be told what can't be done. What needs to be done, has to be done - there is no place for excuses. The mindset of an entrepreneur never wants to hear about what can't be done. 'Can't' only means that a solution needs to be found.</p><p> <strong>  5. Focus on the numbers. </strong>  Entrepreneurs know they'd better learn to keep an eye on the numbers at all times because their cash flow is what will keep them in business. Or, from going out of business. In the end, it&rsquo;s your sales, costs, profit and loss that will either keep you awake at nights or allow you to live a lifestyle that others can only dream of. </p><p> <strong>  6. Work on your business.  </strong> As an entrepreneur, it is critical that you love your business because of the effort and long hours it's going to take to get it off the ground. However, don't fall into the trap of thinking and acting like an employee in your own company. Instead of working &lsquo;in&rsquo; you must rather focus most of your efforts to working &lsquo;on&rsquo; the business. </p><p> <strong>  7. Break the rules. </strong>  As an employee, breaking the rules could mean getting fired. Entrepreneurs on the other hand, aren&rsquo;t interested in following rules &ndash; they&rsquo;re always looking for ways to do things different and better. That means always peering over the horizon, or at least towards it, to where the next big thing is about to happen. The mindset of an entrepreneur doesn't like to be accused of being normal.</p><p> <strong>  8. Your life and business are one. </strong>  As an entrepreneur, while you may not be tied to a desk or computer at all times, you will always be thinking about your business. You will be thinking about what is working well and what could be working better. There will be no break&ndash; you will live and breathe your business. The mindset of an entrepreneur does not know if it is working or playing.</p><p> <strong>  9. The sooner the better. </strong>  It takes time to make the transition from student or employee to entrepreneur, so it makes sense to start shifting your mindset while you&rsquo;re still employed or in school. The sooner you start the better, perhaps even setting up a business to run alongside your current activities. This can give you the opportunity to develop skills and build experience while still enjoying the safety-net of a salary or student loan.</p><p> <strong>  10. Learn to delegate.  </strong> It is important to hire great people to work along side you in the business so you have more time to work on the business. A great idea can turn into a great business only when you find and trust the right people to help you make it happen. Entrepreneurs need help to reach their goals. The mindset of an entrepreneur is always looking for superstars to add to the team.</p><p> <strong>  11. Never stop learning. </strong>  Entrepreneurs who are successful have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and love to learn. That is what makes and keeps these entrepreneurs effective and efficient. The smallest lesson or skill learned can make a huge difference in your life or business. The mindset of an entrepreneur believes that when we stop learning it's time to die.</p><p> <strong>  12. Don't take it easy - take a risk. </strong>  The mindset of an entrepreneur chooses faith over fear every time. Almost all company founders say the willingness to take risks is the usual stepping stone to entrepreneurial success. Without taking calculated risks there is seldom much of a reward to look forward to. When given the choice, a successful entrepreneur always chooses taking a risk over taking it easy.</p><p> <strong>  13. Clearly define your purpose. </strong>  Successful business people care about their lives more than the average person. They take the time to reflect back on their lives, they think in detail about their vision and their purpose in life. They take the time to build mental images that guide them on a path that will lead them to their destiny. They review and refine those images in their mind, they clearly define their vision and then they go to work to create that exact outcome that they have envisioned.</p><p> <strong>  14. Your time is your life. </strong>  Successful entrepreneurs know that they must protect and manage their time at all cost. They plan their day and week before it begins! The most valuable asset you have is your time. Plan your days, weeks, months, and years. The mindset of an entrepreneur knows that you can always get more money if you lose financially, but you can never get more time. When it's gone...it's gone!</p><p> <strong>  15. Focus on the outcome. </strong>  Entrepreneurs have extraordinary clarity on the outcome they wish to accomplish. They take the time to clearly define what it is that they want to do. This gives them the drive to see tasks all the way to their outcome.</p><p> <strong>  16. Just give me the facts.  </strong> Most people make their decisions about their life and careers from emotion and assumptions. Successful entrepreneurs base their decisions from fact-based thinking. The mindset of an entrepreneur is more interested in making decisions based on actual facts, than the opinions, trends and emotions of the rest of the population.</p><p> <strong>  17. Exist to add value.  </strong> Successful entrepreneurs are constantly seeking to make themselves valuable and know that value must be given. They practice the Law of the Harvest. They know for sure that what they give out they shall receive. Successful entrepreneurs do not expect anything for nothing.</p><p> <strong>  18. Transformation by renewal of the mind. </strong>  The mindset of successful entrepreneurs is always improving,  growing and changing. They are constantly educating themselves and gaining experience that will lead them to the goals they have set for themselves. They are always &lsquo;renewing their minds&rsquo;. Entrepreneurs know this is the key to their transformation and growth of themselves and their companies.</p><p> <strong>  19. One rabbit at a time. </strong>  The mindset of undeterred focus is the characteristic which is probably the most important one when it comes to entrepreneurial success. Once you have awakened to the possibilities of success, you also realize the many opportunities that exist all around you. It is very easy to chase many rabbits and don't catch any. Successful entrepreneurs develop the ability to focus and concentrate to maximize their efforts, resources and forces.</p><p> <strong>  20. First seek to understand.  </strong> The best tool I have found to discover myself is the DISC profile. It helps you to develop a greater understanding and belief in yourself, while at the same time helping you understand others. This understanding of yourself and others enables you to communicate much more effectively. The mindset of an entrepreneur is constantly seeking to understand and value themselves in order to have a greater ability to understand and value others.</p><p> <strong>  21. Ignore your critics.  </strong> The mindset of successful entrepreneurs is only open to the criticism of those they respect. If someone doubts your business, or belittles it, take stock of where the criticism is coming from. Jealousy is born from an inability to imitate; others desire what you possess, but cannot attain it. Envy is usually manifested in insults. Some people will want to rain on your parade simply because they don't have a parade of their own.</p><p> <strong>  22. Look for inspiration and correction. </strong>  The successful entrepreneur knows that the \"right\" mindset for success is a combination of wisdom AND a delivery system that works for them. Look for those mentors who have done what you want to do, whose business is where you want yours to go, and who have worked in your specific field. Life is too short to make all the mistakes ourselves. It's always better to learn from the mistakes of others.</p><p> <strong>  23. Create the right mindset. </strong>  Reading the biographies of successful entrepreneurs or listening to entrepreneur podcasts online that interview other successful entrepreneurs are a great way to get yourself into the correct mindset to succeed within your business. Entrepreneurs know that mindset is not set in stone. Mindset can be learned from the experiences of others who are willing to share their wisdom.</p><p> <strong>  24. Learn selective listening. </strong>  The mindset of a successful entrepreneur knows that it must be careful who it listens to. Free advice can sometimes be worth every penny you pay for it. Surround yourself with advisers who will \"give it to you straight\" but at the same time learn how to tune out the pessimists. They always seem to have a problem for every solution.</p><p> <strong>  25. Success is a journey. </strong>  The best way to create the mindset required for success as an entrepreneur is to re-frame success from being a destination to being the progressive improvement of an ongoing process. You set goals, run trials, and then you review the outcome. Many things will not go planned. You simply decide to be happy and enjoy every day, not only the days that go as had hoped for. You never know which will be your last.</p><p> <strong>  26. Embrace your failures. </strong>  Rarely do entrepreneurs &ldquo;get it right&rdquo; the first time. Accepting and embracing failure allows business owners to think more creatively about their product or service. Failure forces entrepreneurs to develop more innovative ways to penetrate their markets and encourages them to think outside the box. The mindset of an entrepreneur doesn't fear failure, only fear itself. The only failure is not learning from your experiences.</p><p> <strong>  27. Keep me-time sacred. </strong>  It's a challenge for entrepreneurs to deal with the ups and downs of business because their company is their baby and can very quickly become an extension of themselves and their identity. It's important keep your me-time as sacred, your holy hour if you will. As well, it is important to have a hobby that helps you relax and clear your mind. The mindset of a successful entrepreneur doesn't connect net-worth to self-worth.</p><p> <strong>  28. Positive attitude.  </strong> An entrepreneur's mindset is convinced that attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference. A positive attitude allows a person to be more objective, encourage others to perform more effectively, and stay focused during tough times. A positive attitude in itself won't help you do everything, but it will help you do everything better than a negative one. Tough times don't last, but tough entrepreneurs do!</p><p> <strong>  29. You are on a mission. </strong>  Entrepreneurs must have the mindset that they are on a mission and trying to achieve something new, despite their lack of experience. This makes them vulnerable to failure and criticism but they have the humility and openness to get a try. They know their vision and their mission must be linked to a cause. They know that their purpose is to eliminate a certain pain in someone else's life. Everything else is a distraction. </p><p> <strong>  30. Finding balance. </strong>  The mindset of a successful entrepreneur understands that when you are starting a business it's difficult to immediately find a life/work balance. To get momentum is harder than maintaining it. Even an airplane needs a lot more energy to get off the ground than it does to maintain level flight. This additional effort takes a toll on your body and therefore it needs to be maintained that much more carefully.</p><p> <strong>  31. Don't fake it. </strong>  In business it is very easy to get caught up doing 'busy' work. If your efforts and actions are not leading to any real results, begin doing something that will. Delegate the less-important tasks that you are personally doing, so you can focus on what will generate revenue and build the company. The mindset of an entrepreneur prefers to be productive rather than faking busyness.</p><p> <strong>  32. Release it.  </strong> Forgiveness is a mindset practice that will skyrocket the success of any entrepreneur. When we hold on to the past wrongs we have all suffered in business and life we imprison ourselves for somebody else's wrongdoing. It is important to let go of the past so that we can start each day with a clean slate. This holds true concerning customer, associate  and business partner relationships. This mindset chooses to forgive and move on. </p><p> <strong>  33. Hang on to it. </strong>  Successful entrepreneurs know the importance of persistence, perseverance and tenacity. This mindset refuses to give up no matter what. It knows that success could be just around the next corner. Giving up now could mean giving up on the brink of a miracle. The mindset of a successful entrepreneur doesn't know the meaning of giving up.</p><p> <strong>  34. Be nice.  </strong> It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice. Being in business is about relationships -- with clients, with vendors, or even just within your own office. The one thing to remember is to always be nice. That doesn't mean that you need to be a push over. It means to be appreciative of the people that you do life and business with. Maintain a nice mindset and you will see how far that will get you in business and in life.</p><p> <strong>  35. Surround yourself with people on the same mission. </strong>  Surround yourself with people who are on the same mission as you are. People who have the same motivation for success will help keep you focused and support you when you face challenges in business. These people will inspire and motivate you in down times. They will also help you create and maintain the mindset of a successful entrepreneur.</p><p> ​Decide now that you need to embrace the mindset of an entrepreneur if you want to be successful in business. Mindset determines actions, and actions determine results. Success always begins in the mind!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-28 22:05:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-28 22:05:05.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_cnQEm9w.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/35-ways-of-thinking-that-every-young-entrepreneur-needs-to-adopt/\", \"post_id\": \"8916\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-28 22:05:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-28 22:05:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"35-ways-of-thinking-that-every-young-entrepreneur-needs-to-adopt\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8917\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4234\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/35-Ways-of-Thinking-That-Every-Young-Entrepreneur-Needs-to-Adopt.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1287\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454096700,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4079,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Markets are Built on Walls of Worry","link":"markets-are-built-on-walls-of-worry","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> To call the market dynamics since the opening of the year jarring would be an understatement.</h3><p> <br/> These past weeks have not only put us on edge, but for some have put their entire portfolio strategy into question.</p><p> What questions are investors asking&mdash;what are you asking? With some pundits forecasting 2016 to be one of the most disastrous years on record, do we bale out while the baling is good? Do we remember the maxim, &ldquo;Buy into weakness?&rdquo; Where do we turn to find the portfolio models that can help us fathom a path forward? It would be easy to say that we have, &ldquo;been through this before.&rdquo; Since entering the markets in the 1970&rsquo;s I have certainly been through extreme turbulence before. The truth, though, is that no situation can be cited to be a reflection or repeat of a previous situation. Every significant shock to the market is driven by its own unique set events&mdash;the outcome, however, is always the same&mdash;prices will fall until they stop falling.</p><h3> For what it is worth, here are a few things to keep in front of us.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The first </strong> is talk to clients. If they are not talking to you they are, most assuredly, talking to someone else. Changes in our perceptions of what is going on cause us all to re-evaluate and re-evaluate our strategy. The more risky, or potentially long-term wealth-destroying, that our perception becomes, the more likely our decision to make a precipitous change. Dialogue is critical, situation-specific assessment is critical, listening is critical. If a change is required, it is more likely to be appropriate when rationally considered.</p><p> <strong>  The second </strong> is to remember, as is always the case, to look at the leadership of the businesses that your portfolios are comprised of. Capable hands on the tiller will usually steer the enterprise through challenging times. Market multiples will land where they will land.

Often, they only create unneeded emotion and fuel irrational behavior that harms long-term returns.As we have written about many times before, at the very least prognostications like this tend to be inaccurate (consider clicking on the following <u> <a href=\"http://www.fwp.partners/preston-d-mcswain/if-we-had-a-chief-economist-we-would-have-to-pay-them/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  If We Had A Chief Economist We Would Have To Pay Them </a></u>).At worst, they are self serving.<h3> How?</h3>When I was a Managing Director at a large asset management firm, I sat in on media training with our senior portfolio managers.  What was the most important message PMs were told to reinforce in interviews?&ldquo;While in front of the camera, be sure to use the opportunity to talk up positions that you just bought to get the herd interested in buying them.&rdquo;Potentially along the lines of today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Delusional&rdquo; comment, PMs were also told to talk down positions that they did not hold, which were part of their index or were large holdings of their competitors.  I actually witnessed portfolio management teams watch CNBC interviews and then cheer as they saw large numbers of buy or sell trades come across the ticker based on their colleague&rsquo;s comments.Related to this, consider the following two true stories from our <u> <a href=\"/advisor/dont-be-a-sheep\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Don&rsquo;t Be A Sheep </a></u> article:<h3> #1 &ndash; The &ldquo;Honest&rdquo; Global Chief Investment Officer</h3>Once, I was having dinner with the Global Chief Investment Officer of the firm for which I worked at the time. I was asking him why his monthly commentary and the first few sections of his team&rsquo;s glossy monthly wealth management publication were becoming more and more short-term trade oriented (consider the advantages of shorting currencies, etc.).  After a little wine, he admitted that most of the pieces would likely not add any value and that some, such as hedging recommendations and currency calls, were quite risky.  He then said,&ldquo;Preston, what you need to understand is that I get paid to publish ideas that we can sell for a profit.  If I don&rsquo;t, the transactional brokers and management complain.  I then lose my job.  I learned a long time ago that it pays to feed the Street.&rdquo;<h3> #2 &ndash; The &ldquo;Honest&rdquo; CEO and Global Head of Alternative Asset Management</h3>In the process of trying to get good insight into a competitor&rsquo;s hedge fund portfolio for a prospect presentation, I went to the CEO of my then-company. Previously, he had been the Global Head of Alternative Asset Management for the firm that had created the hedge fund portfolio I was analyzing. Perfect, I thought, he led the group that created all of the products.  After I gave him a brief overview, he smiled and said,&ldquo;Preston, you&rsquo;re thinking too much.  You are correct, the performance of the portfolios has been bad.  We had a great brand though, an even better Ivy League MBA sales team, and we knew it.  So, we looked at products one way. If we could sell them, they were good.&rdquo;I could go on and on about this, but reaching back again to our last post, don&rsquo;t let your brain get flamed up by stock market commentators or marketing presentations.  Remember, market flames fueled by sensational quotes and headlines can burn down your investment portfolio.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-29 17:24:10.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-29 17:24:10.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_tly1C0x.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/talking-heads/\", \"post_id\": \"8921\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-29 17:24:10\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-29 17:24:10\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"talking-heads\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8920\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4236\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Talking-Heads-IRIS.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1438\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454149800,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

Then I was amused at my own surprise. I had momentarily forgotten this is logical behavior for a company whose profits depend on its customers actively buying and selling. <strong>  It is not legally required to look out for customers&rsquo; best interests and has no incentive to do so. </strong></p><p> Clearly, the time-honored way of earning market returns over the long haul is to diversify among asset classes, rebalance religiously, and always stay in the markets. The research is overwhelming that shows those who attempt to time the markets have significantly lower returns over the long haul than those who don&rsquo;t. According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/20150408-streettalk-live-dalbar-why-investors-suck-and-tips-for-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study by Dalbar, Inc  </a> </u> ., over the last twenty years the average underperformance of investors and advisors that timed the market was 7.12% a year.</p><p> What&rsquo;s so bad about trying to minimize loses and selling out when things begin looking scary? Nothing. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to exit markets just in time to watch them fall so low that you could sweep up bargains by buying back in? Therein lies the problem: not only do you need to get out on time (not too early and not too late), but you must then know when to get back in.</p><p> The only way I know to do this is to own a crystal ball, <strong>  which the economists at RBS apparently possess. </strong> Here are a few of the things they say to expect:</p><li> Oil could fall as low as $16 a barrel.</li><li> The world has far too much debt to be able to grow well.</li><li> Advances in technology and automation will wipe out up to half of all jobs.</li><li> Global disinflation is turning to global deflation as China and the US sharply devalue their currencies.</li><li> Stocks could fall 10% to 20%. <br/>  </li><p> The last prediction was the one that grabbed my attention. Given the comparison of the coming year to 2008, I expected a forecast of a significantly greater drop in stocks, say 40% to 60%. Comparatively, their forecast of 10% to 20% seems almost rosy.</p><p> While RBS is particularly gloomy, bearish forecasts have also been issued by other investment brokerage firms, including JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, and Macquarie.</p><p> Just for perspective, here&rsquo;s a look at  <u>  <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/01/the-author-of-the-rbs-sell-everything-note-has-been-predicting-disaster-for-the-last-five-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   previous predictions from Andrew Roberts  </a> </u> , the RBS analyst who issued the recent dire warning.

{"original_id":4084,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"This Is How To Plan Your Content","link":"this-is-how-to-plan-your-content","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The idea of planning out the content you are going to create seems like an easy enough task, right? I mean, just take some time and jot down all your awesome ideas and done! Well, sort of&hellip;</p><p> See, if you&rsquo;re feeling completely overwhelmed by the whole content planning process, you&rsquo;re not alone. Your content planning hurdle isn&rsquo;t a lack of great ideas; it&rsquo;s validating these good ideas for the right audience in the right way. With just a little more direction and structure to your content planning process, you&rsquo;ll be organizing your content for success in no time.</p><p> <strong>  Here are 10 manageable steps you can take to plan your content out like a content marketer and start seeing better results: </strong></p><h3> Step 1: Create Your Content Mission Statement</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  To create content that is going to serve your brand, you have to first identify how you want your content to support specific business goals. </strong>  Therefore, the first step is to have your firm&rsquo;s business objectives front and center for everyone responsible for content marketing success.</p><p> By doing this, you will be able to identify which goals your brand is having difficulty achieving and this will inform a content strategy highly focused to overcome it. And this will then lead into creating a content mission statement: an outline of your company&rsquo;s reason for creating content and the priorities and perspectives it will uphold in pursuit of that mission (as defined by the Content Marketing Institute).</p><p> Knowing why you are creating content and towards what purpose is the cornerstone of successful content marketing. Don&rsquo;t skip this step. It will keep you and everyone else on the team aligned with creating content that helps achieve business goals.</p><h3> Step 2: Set Content Program Goals</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Speaking of goals, once you have your mission statement created, it will be that much easier to identify your content program goals. </strong> These content goals are set in addition to an overall business goal and are more specific to the function of the content itself!</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a simple example:</p><p> Business goal: To grow revenue by 25% in the next 12 months.</p><p> Challenge: The company is not on pace for this increased revenue and is challenged to bring in new clients who have never done business with them before.</p><p> So, perfectly acceptable Content Program Goals could be to raise awareness in the marketplace and increase sales leads through its website.</p><p> When your content program is focused on a couple goals and it is documented, it will prevent the knee-jerk &ldquo;do everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;throw spaghetti at the wall&rdquo; temptation. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be much more poised for success when you have a clear destination in mind.</p><h3> Step 3: Map Out Your Sales Funnel</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  What specific steps do your clients go through to become a client? </strong> Write it down, draw it out &ndash; each step. Every brand&rsquo;s sales funnel is different with some similarities, so make sure you map out yours specifically. How do the majority of your customers find your business? What do they do first? Next? How do they contact you? What action do you guide them to take? What is the hand-off from marketing to sales? Sales to customer service?</p><p> Knowing the experience your potential clients walk through that leads them on the path of becoming beloved clients will come in handy in just a few more steps.</p><h3> Step 4: Identify Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  This step is so important I harp on it in almost all of my articles. </strong> No matter how good your plan is, the only true measure of successful content is whether or not your audience love it. Period. End of story. If you&rsquo;re creating content and feel like it&rsquo;s just not working &ndash; it&rsquo;s you, not them. You have no idea how generous your audience will be with their time and support if you provide them with valuable content they can use and that makes them look good to share.</p><p> So friends, if you have avoided creating buyer personas up to this point &ndash; it is time. If you don&rsquo;t, Steps 4 through 10 will be worthless. I mean it. You absolutely must know who your audience is, intimately.  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/resources/defining-your-ideal-client/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   If you need help developing these, go here to download a guide for defining your ideal client  </u>  . </a>  This will walk you through building your buyer personas and supply you with free templates you can fill out as well.</p><h3> Step 5: List Out Your Audience&rsquo;s Biggest Challenges and Priorities</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Step five is a continuation of Step 4. </strong> In building out your buyer personas, you will have researched and identified your ideal client&rsquo;s biggest challenges and most pressing priorities. Isolate these and generate a separate list with just this information.</p><p> Having this list of your ideal client&rsquo;s biggest challenges and priorities will help you create content topic ideas that help them in these most important areas. If you are a financial advisor targeting a professional woman between the ages of 30 and 40 years old who runs her own business, one of her biggest challenges might be keeping her business finances organized, because she is simply too busy to stay on top of it. Remaining focused on her and her challenges is going to help you position your brand and your content in the next step.</p><h3> Step 6: List Out Your Brand&rsquo;s Value to Your Customer</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  When you really understand your audience, what&rsquo;s most important to them and where their biggest challenges exist in their life, </strong> you can more effectively plan content that serves them and their needs.</p><p> On the same page where you listed out all of your audience&rsquo;s biggest challenges and most pressing priorities, create a second column next to these and write down the value your brand delivers that helps address or solve their needs. It can literally be as simple as this quick image I sketched out here that uses the example of a financial advisor targeting a woman business owner.</p><p> Know what you bring to the table for your ideal client. When you focus your value to their problem, you can really cook-up some wonderful content ideas that will resonate.</p><h3> Step 7: Generate Your Awesome Ideas</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Now you&rsquo;re ready to put pen to paper and generate some content ideas. </strong> You know which business objectives your content program is supporting. You understand the goals your content should achieve. You&rsquo;ve mapped out the sales funnel so you know when and where content will be most valuable. You deeply understand who your target audience is, their challenges and the value your brand delivers to them.</p><p> Each content idea should map to a goal and speak directly to your target audience. Have fun and think outside the box. I personally go through an exercise in which I generate ideas freely on a blank piece of paper. I give myself the freedom to brainstorm without limitations and then carefully organize my ideas into a simple Excel spreadsheet before transferring my ideas into a well-planned editorial calendar. If you&rsquo;re not one to sit down and write, dictate to yourself to capture all your ideas before transcribing. As strategic as content planning is, it is still a creative process and this is the step where you need to let yourself explore.</p><h3> Step 8: Align Your Content Ideas to Sales Funnel</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Then organize all your awesome content ideas content by audience, stage in the sales funnel and format. </strong> This will ensure that your content ideas aren&rsquo;t just ideas, but strategically planned to achieve its mission and goals.</p><p> Generally speaking, most sales funnels follow a progression like this, but be sure to follow your firm&rsquo;s sales funnel that you prepared in Step 3 so that it&rsquo;s customized to your client&rsquo;s unique experience with you.</p><li> <strong>  Certain content will be used for awareness or first impression.  </strong> This is the content that someone might be looking for that provides them a first introduction to your brand and starts building trust.</li><li> <strong>  Other content maps to consideration or deeper understanding of what you do.  </strong> This is the content that moves your ideal client from just a general awareness of your brand to closer engagement where they may download a unique offer in exchange for their contact information so that you can continue to follow-up with them directly.</li><li> <strong>  Then you&rsquo;ll have content specifically for decision-making. </strong>  This is the content that helps them make a purchasing decision. Maybe it&rsquo;s a special they can&rsquo;t resist.</li><li> <strong>  And finally you&rsquo;ll have content that&rsquo;s geared towards deepening your relationship on an ongoing basis. </strong>  This is the content that continues to add value to your audience long after they become a client. <br/>  </li><h3> Step 9: Organize Your Editorial Calendar</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  By this step, you are so organized and ready to go it&rsquo;s ridiculous! </strong> Wow! All that&rsquo;s left is to organize all your content into an editorial calendar so that you keep yourself accountable and consistent. Your editorial calendar will organize content due dates, roles, formats, audience, sales funnel stage, distribution channel, publish dates, content-specific goals and maybe even your target keywords.</p><p> There are some great editorial calendar templates out there and many marketing automation tools have more advanced tools you can use. The free and easy way is to create an Excel spreadsheet with a column for each of the items I list above. To get even more organized and automated so that you can more efficiently plan, publish and distribute your content &ndash; I highly recommend  <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  CoSchedule </a> , an all in one content marketing scheduler.</p><h3> Step 10: Create</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  You&rsquo;re ready now. </strong> Create with confidence that your content will connect, engage and perform. And one more word of advice: create content as if you were creating for an audience of one (good thing you have those buyer personas!). When you have someone very specific in mind, you tend to create content that is more personal, more valuable and allows you to connect deeply. Remember to be yourself. As a professional service provider, one of the ways you differentiate your content from others in your industry isn&rsquo;t necessarily by the topics you address, but HOW you address them and the unique personality you unleash to deliver value.</p><p> And that, my friends, is how to plan your content. Good luck and you know where to find me if you have any questions or need help along the way!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-30 21:08:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-30 21:08:08.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_cNguIci.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-is-how-to-plan-your-content/\", \"post_id\": \"8928\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-30 21:08:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-30 21:08:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-is-how-to-plan-your-content\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8927\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4241\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/This-Is-How-To-Plan-Your-Content.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"425\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454353200,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}

It may be more eloquently expressed, but this is the essential description of what the financial plan is all about.  And then we put a price tag on it.  Perhaps we even show them a sample of the work we have done for other clients, and mildly impress them with the range of colours we have in our pie charts in the 45 page plan.</p><h3> But what does the customer hear?</h3><p> <br/> If we look at it from their perspective our comprehensive advice process sounded like this:</p><p> &ldquo;This financial planning thing is going to cost me $3,000 (say), and for that I will get a report that tells me what I&rsquo;m thinking and what I want, and will give me suggestions on how to get it?  Why would I pay someone to tell me what I already know I am thinking and wanting?  And $3,000 (say) sounds like a lot for a heap of paper and pie charts I don&rsquo;t want to read&rdquo;</p><h3> And so, we have price resistance.</h3><p> <br/> The resistance is there not because the number is too high, or even necessarily unaffordable, but because there is no link in the customers mind to the value they will obtain for that fee.</p><p> With all of the focus in recent years on technical content and learning, together with higher standards of client care and thorough documentation, and having all that supported by evidence and research, there is no doubt that planners are usually delivering better quality advice than ever before.</p><p> But the customer struggles to see the value of it when we are essentially asking them to trust our prowess and process, and pay upfront&hellip;.to tell them things they think they already actually know.  That is going to be pretty tough to sell to most consumers.</p><p> Of course, WE know that the consumers don&rsquo;t actually know how to plan to achieve the goals and mitigate the risks along the way usually.  We also know that they don&rsquo;t generally engage in adequate research or consider a range of strategies and tactics to determine the optimal path.  We know that a lack of objectivity leads to irrational decisions and behaviour, and that irrationality will often be enough to derail anyone.</p><h3> But we can&rsquo;t tell them that.  Because what they will hear is:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me I&rsquo;m too dumb to do it myself?  Good luck finding a client pal, because it isn&rsquo;t going to be me&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> If we go down that path we will have price resistance combined with active dislike of the adviser and the advisers message.  Hardly a recipe for engaging new clients, is it?</p><p> There are essentially two courses of action if we want clients to engage, and break down the barriers:</p><li> <strong>  Position the offer differently. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Break down the service into palatable pieces. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> In terms of positioning the offer differently we need to move away from describing our delightful process and professional conduct, and zero in on what the consumer actually cares about. We also need to couch the language in such a way that it creates the intrigue or desire because there is an immediate sense of value.</p><p> &ldquo;For $3,000 I figure out how people can realistically have the life they deserve &ndash; and sooner than they usually believed possible&rdquo;</p><p> Think about that positioning.  Without introducing the magic of our process and prowess we just described exactly what it is we do for people, and in such a way that the price seems very fair indeed.  And what we are saying is very very likely to be exactly what they want to hear now&hellip;.</p><p> <strong>  Who wouldn&rsquo;t pay $3,000 (or whatever the planning fee is) to unlock the secret of how to get the life they want? </strong></p><p> In my next post I&rsquo;ll discuss how as an alternative we could break down planning into palatable pieces as a method of eliminating price resistance.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-30 21:22:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-30 21:22:04.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_Dag9kao.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/fees-the-problem-is-what-we-say-is-not-what-they-hear/\", \"post_id\": \"8930\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-30 21:22:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-30 21:22:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"fees-the-problem-is-what-we-say-is-not-what-they-hear\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8929\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4242\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fees-The-Problem-Is-What-We-Say-Is-Not-What-They-Hear.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"771\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454369400,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

A  <u>  <a href=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/55706/ChangingFacePreview.pdf?t=1440005292146\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   survey  </a> </u>  of 500 financial advisors by Corporate Insight released earlier in 2015 found that 2 out of 3 finance brands now use social media for business. The most popular network is LinkedIn with 52%, followed by Facebook with 24% and Twitter with 13%.</p><p> Managing social media for financial services has  <u>  inherent challenges </u> . However the benefits of client acquisition, branding, customer service and thought leadership are there for the taking &mdash; so let&rsquo;s take a look at overcoming them together.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Compliance &amp; Regulation </strong></h3><p> <br/> You HAVE to understand and overcome complaince and regulation to succeed in managing social media for a financial services company.</p><p> Regulators like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CySEC  </a> </u> , the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FCA  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FSA  </a> </u>  strictly govern banks, lenders, trading companies and other financial institutions and believe me &hellip; they don&rsquo;t mess around. Every image, link, and comment you post must be compliant or you run the risk of landing your brand in hot water with a regulatory fine. Regulatory fines can run into the millions and could be for something as trivial as using the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</p><p> Following increasing pressure from social media managers, the FCA recently released this  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/static/documents/finalised-guidance/fg15-04.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guide  </a> </u>  which addresses important issues like how to add risk warnings to short tweets and how to display JPEGs.  It&rsquo;s pretty useful but still leaves us with a huge responsibility and a lot of restrictions.</p><p> <img alt=\"finance 1\" src=\"http://www.agorapulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/finance-1.jpg\"/></p><h3> Overcome The Challenge <br/>  </h3><li> Educate all employees using social media about compliance rules.</li><li> Build a library of compliance-approved images &amp; updates for major market events.</li><li> If in doubt, don&rsquo;t post it or check with your company lawyer. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  2. Product Visualization </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s be honest: the financial world can be pretty dull &mdash; so how can you make it look exciting? This is where you will need a skilled social media manager because product visualization in the online finance world is tough. We are not allowed to show any images which give the impression of instant wealth, openly invite people to invest, make investment look easy or trivialize the risk factor.</p><p> A few financial companies which I feel have done a great job of this via social media are  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153039916911730.1073741834.322073386729&amp;type=3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   easy-forex  </a> </u>  which allows followers to get to know its employees,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BarclaysUK/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Barclays UK  </a> </u>  which focuses on community interaction and engagement, and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MasterCard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MasterCard  </a> </u>  which fully utilizes its YouTube channel. The key, as with most social media, is to connect human to human. This approach tends to be less of a worry in terms of regulation.</p><p> <img alt=\"barclays\" src=\"http://www.agorapulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/barclays.png\"/></p><h3> Overcome The Challenge <br/>  </h3><li> Don&rsquo;t copy product-focused brands like CocaCola. Your strategy will be different.</li><li> Learn to illustrate money without showing money. Think about lifestyle aspirations.</li><li> Feature employees, surroundings and community events for maximum interaction. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  3. Speed </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you thought social media was fast moving then you never worked in finance.</p><p> Currency movements are second-to-second with regular breaking news announcements happening throughout the day. Investors are constantly waiting for the latest updates regarding issues such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonfarmpayroll.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Non Farm Payroll  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   FED announcements  </a> </u> . Because you will not know the outcome of these events until they happen it is necessary to pay attention to financial channels or in my case, fully utilize Twitter! Your followers will be looking to you for the latest market news which can be a pretty demanding responsibility.</p><h3> Overcome The Challenge <br/>  </h3><li> Use an RSS feed from a reputable source for your Twitter such as  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bloomberg Business  </a> </u> .</li><li> Share financial updates on Facebook from reputable sources like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Reuters/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Reuters  </a> </u> .</li><li> Plan ahead with financial calendars like the one at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FXStreet  </a> </u> . <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. Contests </strong></h3><p> <br/> Contests&hellip; in the finance world? Surely that&rsquo;s not possible! Well it is: you just have to play it carefully.</p><p> Why not run a contest around a financial event like &ldquo;Guess the NFP Number&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vote in our Poll.&rdquo; Use trending financial hashtags such as  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GBP&amp;src=typd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #GBP  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23usd&amp;src=typd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #USD  </a> </u>  to add extra attention to your promotions.  <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"poll_vote_now\" src=\"http://www.agorapulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/poll_vote_now.jpg\"/></p><p> Remember that you are the public spokesperson for a very serious and heavily regulated brand. Your prizes may be credit or tangible prizes although you need to confirm that with your legal team. Consider an educational giveaway or prize such as an eBook or free training session&hellip; these always go down well.</p><p> The benefits of using Facebook marketing tools like the ones offered by Agorapulse is that you are able to run contests in accordance with Facebook&rsquo;s terms and conditions. This is really important because if you are a large page you could risk losing it completely if you break the house rules.</p><p> The other advantage is that you can add terms and conditions and legally gather opt-in data.</p><h3> Overcome The Challenge <br/>  </h3><li> Make sure your legal team draw up and approve your terms and conditions.</li><li> Always use Facebook-approved apps for contests or polls.</li><li> Be careful about announcing full winner names.</li><li> Learn the trending hashtags for the financial world. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  5. Bad PR </strong></h3><p> <br/> Bad PR is a nightmare for all social media managers but for those managing financial services brands it can be especially tricky. Why? Because you know that  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-response-time-data\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  72% of people </a>  who complain on Twitter expect a response in an hour &mdash; yet the wrong response could land your brand in hot water. So if you have a few unhappy clients, your entire morning could be spent researching their individual cases, formulating a response with your legal team and responding to the client.</p><h3> Overcome The Challenge <br/>  </h3><li> Never post client details, account numbers or confidential information publicly.</li><li> Always consult your legal team before responding to a complaint online</li><li> Acknowledge the client in a noncommittal way &ldquo;Thanks for tweeting us, please allow us some time to investigate your case and send you a DM&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  I hope that you found these tips useful and remember: if you can succeed in managing social media for financial services, you are truly awesome! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-30 21:42:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-30 21:42:45.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_B7C8Aa2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-be-great-at-social-media-for-financial-services/\", \"post_id\": \"8932\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-30 21:42:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-30 21:42:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-be-great-at-social-media-for-financial-services\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8931\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4243\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Be-Great-at-Social-Media-For-Financial-Services.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"602\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454324400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4087,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Tips for Long Distance Caregiving","link":"tips-for-long-distance-caregiving","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Overseeing the care of an aging relative from a distance is stressful. And since so many families live miles apart, the concerns of a parent's safety, health, and nutrition is hard to coordinate and manage when a distance is a significant factor.</p><h3> Long-Distance Caregiving</h3><p> <br/> The National Alliance for Caregiving estimates 44 million Americans care for an older parent, and almost 20% of them live at least one hour away from the parent. And close to 33% provide care at a distance for someone living with a form of dementia. It's hard to believe, but 25% of the long distance family members say they are the main person overseeing a relative's care.</p><p> AARP relates to long-distance caregiving as the new standard for family members. Families first split apart when kids move to another city to college and never return. After the young adult graduates, they take jobs in far off places and sometimes out-of-state.</p><p> In the report by MetLife, even the adults over 65 are mobile today. Almost sixty-five percent have moved to other states in the last ten years. And when they need help with the activities of daily living tasks, it's up to the child living away to coordinate the care.</p><h3> Challenges of Long-Distance Caregiving</h3><p> <br/> The challenges are overwhelming like finding local resources to help the parent out. Other hardships:</p><li> <strong>  The household </strong> - before taking on a parent's care, create a plan for your home and your immediate family. Let them know your schedule and discuss how it will affect them. Remember to balance the needs of your parents with the needs of your family.</li><li> <strong>  Your job </strong> - long distance caregiving can impact work. Don't make any significant changes, like quitting the job. It will threaten your financial security. Discuss all options with your employer or the human resource department to make your employment fit with parent care.</li><li> <strong>  Your care </strong> - don't put everyone else first and ignore your health. So many people count on you that it's easy to forget about yourself. The kids, the job, the spouse, and now your parents rely on you. Remember to step back and take ample time for yourself.</li><li> <strong>  Your finances </strong> - Families who care for parents report spending $200 a month out-of-pocket on an aging relative. The money pays for prescriptions, home maintenance, food, and travel expenses. <br/>  </li><h3> Things To Do</h3><p> Organize the parent's paperwork - Gather a loved one's personal, health, financial, and legal records. It's easier to put in file and store in one place. Do it before an emergency occurs and when you're under-the-gun.</p><p> Organize the network of care - Put together a list of contacts, phone numbers, and addresses:</p><li> <strong>  Friends </strong></li><li> <strong>  Neighbors </strong></li><li> <strong>  Physician </strong></li><li> <strong>  Healthcare providers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Insurance agents </strong></li><li> <strong>  Home care agency </strong></li><li> <strong>  Geriatric care manager </strong></li><li> <strong>  Local aging resources </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The best choices to connect are via a phone call, a text, Skype, and Facebook.</p><p> Get prepared before an emergency happens. Put a plan together for those who want to help. Set aside extra money in case you need to travel.

Consider, for the purpose of this blog, that your customer is a close friend or associate.  Now, do you know what they like, their age, their personal quirks, or whether they like to shop based on reviews?   What is their income level?  Education? The more you know, the more you can target to them and make them feel good. In return, they will like you, then, trust you, and, finally, buy from you.  Even better, they will send their friends.</p><p> Would you prefer the restaurant that knows your table and your favorite wine, versus the one that SHOULD know your favorite table, and SHOULD know your favorite wine?  After all, you go there often enough.</p><p> Are your customers changing and are you keeping up with those changes? That really is all that&rsquo;s meant when we speak of &ldquo;demographics,&rdquo; a boring ancient term that describes the characteristics of your customer, like age, race, sex, economic status, level of education, income level, and employment.  Trends in your customer population are really, really important, and it&rsquo;s critical to your business to take advantage of these opportunities.   For instance, college students are older, more diverse, and take longer to graduate than those 10 to 20 years ago.</p><h3> Get what I mean? </h3><p> <br/> Trends and life choices change over time, due to economic, cultural, or political circumstances.  As the business owner, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of these changes, adapt your marketing, and keep an out for the next demographic change.</p><p> Some key examples:</p><li> <strong>  The aging population, here and around the globe, will have a profound effect on businesses. </strong> As baby boomers age, retire, and spend less, they&rsquo;re being replaced by the millennials (24-45) who have far different values and spending habits, i.e., using mobile devices for most of their activities.</li><li> <strong>  Asia, Europe, and the USA have an older population, while developing countries are largely much younger. </strong> The average age in Japan is 46, in England 40, and the USA 38.  In contrast, Palestine is 18, Canada 25, and India 27.</li><li> <strong>  The 50 million new women in the labor force over the past decades are dramatically affecting change as they rise to leadership positions and achieve more opportunities. </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> Recommendations and Opportunities: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Survey your customers with attractive incentives, i.e., really helpful tips, enewsletters, and giveaways. </strong>  The internet is changing the playing field tremendously, but is also offering inexpensive ways to know your customer.</li><li> <strong>  Mobile is here </strong> &hellip;and we still don&rsquo;t know the extent of how far into our lives and habits it will venture (kids today can do term papers on their phones, from internet research, to typing it, to submitting it to the teacher, using Siri and Wikipedia as research sources. Yikes!).  Consider a mobile presence if you haven&rsquo;t gone there yet.  An easy &ldquo;How am I doing?&rdquo; to your customer on their phone can be easy way to stay in touch AND keep an eye on your market. <br/>  </li><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> All I mean to say is that if demographics and particularly customer trends (whether large or small) are ignored, it will put any business in jeopardy. The takeaway from this: consistently evaluate relevant demographics/trends so you catch the small ones. Then adapt and keep your eyes on the horizon.  <strong>  Demographics can be one of the keys to your business success. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-30 22:39:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-30 22:39:58.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_mxWqYDF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-absolute-importance-of-knowing-the-demographics-of-your-market/\", \"post_id\": \"8936\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-30 22:39:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-30 22:39:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-absolute-importance-of-knowing-the-demographics-of-your-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8935\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4246\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Absolute-Importance-of-Knowing-the-Demographics-of-Your-Market.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"628\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454317200,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

Forward-thinking businesses have already connected the dots. They understand that investments made to improve employee morale today pay dividends down the road as output ticks up.</p><p> <strong>  How happy are your employees? </strong> Whether they&rsquo;re grinning ear to ear or have the most tragic frowns stuck on their faces, chances are they could always be at least a little bit happier. Here&rsquo;s how you can make that happen:</p><h3> 1. Reward your employees &mdash; often</h3><p> <br/> Many of your employees work hard for you day in and day out. When they go above and beyond and do a great job, it can be really difficult to be greeted with silence from management. What&rsquo;s the point in working hard if nobody ever seems to notice?</p><p> Make it a habit to reward your employees on a regular basis. Whenever someone does a great job, don&rsquo;t hesitate to offer that individual your praise &mdash; in a very vocal and public manner. You could also start a new tradition, like giving out a $25 gift card to Amazon at the end of each month to the person who put in the most effort or had the most victories.  </p><p> When you congratulate workers on a job well done and really show that you mean it, they&rsquo;re more likely to work even harder next time. And when you specify what they did well, they can continue to replicate that behavior.</p><h3> 2. Build an awesome office</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Working in cubicles can be absolutely miserable. </strong> If your desk is positioned unfortunately enough, you could theoretically make it the entire day without seeing the sunshine (particularly during winter).</p><p> To make your employees happier, think about ways you can improve the layout of your office. Better yet, be on the lookout for new office space &mdash; and switch locations when the timing&rsquo;s right. Large, open workspaces with lots of natural light can go a long way toward improving employee morale.</p><h3> 3. Offer the best perks you can think of</h3><p> <br/> Everyone works for a paycheck. The heavier that paycheck is, the more likely the employee is to be happy at work. Beyond increasing their salaries, though, you can also make your employees happier by offering lots of perks.</p><p> For example, let them make their own schedules. Let them work where they want to work. Buy them catered lunches every so often. Build a company game room and don&rsquo;t be mad at them when they spend a half hour playing ping-pong. They don't have to be fancy perks &mdash; just ones that will make their lives easier.</p><h3> 4. Listen to your employees &mdash; their ideas and their complaints</h3><p> <br/> One of the easiest ways to make your employees feel valued &mdash; and therefore happier &mdash; is to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/?utm_source=unpaid&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=blogtrial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   proactively solicit their feedback  </a> </u> . But it&rsquo;s not enough to simply ask questions. You need to actually listen to their responses.</p><p> If a worker has a killer idea, turn it into reality &mdash; and fast. Ask them how processes can improve. After all, they're the ones in the trenches. They've probably figured out ways to do work more quickly and efficiently.</p><h3> 5. Give ample opportunities for professional development</h3><p> <br/> Your employees want to advance in their careers; no one wants to be the newbie forever. Do what you can to invest in your employees&rsquo; futures. Let your workers attend relevant conferences. Host optional workshops aimed at developing (or enhancing) specific skills.</p><p> Your employees will notice your investment, and they&rsquo;ll feel happier knowing you care about their careers.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no reason your employees should be miserable at work. By thinking creatively and making a few changes here and there, you&rsquo;ll almost certainly improve your team&rsquo;s morale. And the corresponding boost in productivity will work wonders for your bottom line.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-30 22:55:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-30 22:55:50.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_pKyXkTd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-unexpected-link-between-workplace-happiness-and-productivity/\", \"post_id\": \"8937\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-30 22:55:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-30 22:55:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-unexpected-link-between-workplace-happiness-and-productivity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8938\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4247\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Unexpected-Link-Between-Workplace-Happiness-and-Productivity_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"675\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454335200,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4091,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Ultimate Unplanned Business Exit - Death","link":"the-ultimate-unplanned-business-exit-death","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As advisors, most of us leave any discussion of how an owner&rsquo;s death will affect his or her family and business to our estate planning colleagues.</h3><p> An exit via death is not a topic that owners want to consider or discuss so we move the item to someone else&rsquo;s agenda.</p><p> Let me suggest that if you are to be a trusted advisor as it relates to owners&rsquo; business exits during their lifetimes, you must play a role in protecting their families and businesses from a business exit due to their deaths. To offer candid and valuable counsel, you don&rsquo;t have to be an Exit Planning expert, but you do have to initiate the difficult conversation about protecting the owner&rsquo;s family and business.</p><p> This article, and the next several, will not turn you into an estate planner, but I hope you&rsquo;ll gain a better understanding of how the tools you already possess to craft lifetime business exits are the same that you&rsquo;ll use to take some of the sting out of an owner&rsquo;s &ldquo;ultimate exit.&rdquo;</p><h3> Death Is Not Kind</h3><p> <br/> Most of us have experienced, first hand, the fall out that both businesses and families experience after an owner&rsquo;s unexpected death. The owner&rsquo;s primary goal&mdash;financial security for family&mdash;is often buried with the owner. That is a tragedy in itself, but it is an avoidable tragedy because advisors can prevent it.</p><p> Think about your owner-clients for a moment. If they unexpectedly die,</p><li> Does their family&rsquo;s need for financial security die with them?</li><li> Do their hopes and dreams for the future of their businesses die?</li><li> Is it possible to achieve same goals the owner set for his or her lifetime exit? <br/>  </li><h3> When Estate Planning Is Not Enough</h3><p> <br/> An owner&rsquo;s lifetime goals and aspirations for business and family are at the heart of Exit Planning. As an advisor who helps owners care plans to achieve their lifetime goals, you must work to make sure that owners achieve the same goals should they die. In fact, if you sit by while owners engage in estate planning without a clear focus on their lifetime exit goals&mdash;and what it takes to achieve them&mdash;their estate plans will likely fail, and some will fail miserably. Consider the case of Ralph Cabrini (a fictional owner).</p><p> After months of conversations, Ralph Cabrini&rsquo;s insurance advisor finally convinced him to &ldquo;get an estate plan.&rdquo; Ralph was married, had two young children and owned a thriving general construction company. He had a couple of key employees who managed all of the company&rsquo;s projects.</p><p> As part of the discussion, the estate planning attorney suggested to Ralph that he consider doing something (from a lifetime planning standpoint) to ensure that his two key people would stay with the company for the long haul. Ralph, with a wave of his hand, dismissed the idea. \"I don't worry about them leaving. I pay them plenty.\"</p><p> Two months after signing his wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and related documents Ralph died. &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; the insurance advisor and estate planning attorney thought, &ldquo;at least his estate plan is in good shape.&rdquo; But they were wrong. Three months after Ralph&rsquo;s death the business and his estate were bankrupt.</p><p> Shortly after Ralph's death, his two key employees realized that the business could not survive without him. While they felt badly for Ralph&rsquo;s family, they decided that their first responsibility was to support their own families. They found jobs with new employers who had contacted them shortly after Ralph&rsquo;s death. Without their supervision, the projects the company had underway faltered. Lack of progress put the construction contracts into default, and the bond company eventually foreclosed on the company&rsquo;s assets. The bond company then threatened to file suit against Ralph's estate for the bond default.</p><p> Ralph&rsquo;s estate plan worked, insofar as it properly transferred his estate at death to the intended beneficiaries. The problem was that there was nothing to transfer. The business and the value of Ralph&rsquo;s estate had evaporated.</p><p> <strong>   How would you have made sure that, in the event of Ralph's death, his company could have: </strong></p><li> Completed its projects?</li><li> Been liquidated in a financially responsible manner?</li><li> Continued without Ralph? <br/>  </li><p> Your starting point, as it is in all aspects of Exit Planning, is to ask questions. In this case there are four questions that you must ask and owners must answer:</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;If you die or become permanently disabled tomorrow: </strong></p><li> Will your family be able to maintain the lifestyle you want for them?</li><li> Will your business survive?</li><li> Will your business transfer according to your wishes?</li><li> Will your other goals, including your values-based goals, be achieved?&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> Had Ralph&rsquo;s estate planners asked the questions and pushed him to answer them, his family and business would not have suffered as greatly.</p><p> <strong>  Ralph&rsquo;s sad end teaches an important lesson: </strong> Exit Planning and estate planning are inseparable for business owners. Few estate planning advisors are trained Exit Planners and few Exit Planning advisors are well-informed regarding estate planning. As a result, we leave Mack Truck sized holes in owners&rsquo; estate planning and Exit Planning.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-31 02:31:55.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-31 02:31:55.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_uqhpiAz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-ultimate-unplanned-business-exit-death/\", \"post_id\": \"8940\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-31 02:31:55\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-31 02:31:55\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-ultimate-unplanned-business-exit-death\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8939\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4248\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Ultimate-Unplanned-Business-Exit-Death.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"819\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454322600,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4092,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Find Your Flow to Create Magic at Work and in Life","link":"how-to-find-your-flow-to-create-magic-at-work-and-in-life","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> So you want to find your flow, but how do you know when you&rsquo;re there? What does it feel like to be in flow?</h3><p> <br/> In the zone.</p><p> Energized.</p><p> On fire.</p><p> Embodied confidence.</p><p> All in.</p><p> At peace.</p><p> Whole.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve had many conversations with clients over the years about not only what it feelslike when they&rsquo;re in flow, but also how to find it and, more importantly, create it.</p><p> Typically, when I start to work with people, something is hard; they&rsquo;re facing a challenge, are ready for a change, but don&rsquo;t know how to get there on their own. Moreover, they want to find their flow. When every step feels impossible and more work than it&rsquo;s worth, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to keep going.</p><h3> What does flow look like in motion?</h3><p> <br/> Late last year our family got a Kinect for the Xbox and the Just Dance game to go with it. This past weekend, my son was dancing to his favorite song and shouted to me to &ldquo;watch this!&rdquo;</p><p> He closed his eyes and kept dancing.</p><p> He knew the motions but, more importantly, felt the music with his whole being. Smiling, moving, and completely immersed, he scored his top points of the game. Eyes open and his thinking brain in charge he did okay, eyes closed, in flow, he rocked it.</p><p> Did my son get &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for every move and gyration &ndash; no way! He won&rsquo;t be on So You Think You Can Dance anytime soon. He tapped into joy and didn&rsquo;t worry about every arm bend or dip.</p><p> When I watched him, I saw flow in motion&hellip; the ultimate letting go of the need to be perfect and truly stepping forward into boldly being.</p><h3> How can one kid dancing in an online challenge help you find your flow? </h3><h3> <br/> Take a Risk</h3><p> <br/> My son didn&rsquo;t know that he could do it with his eyes closed, but he believed it was possible. Find your flow by getting out of your routine and into something that gives you some butterflies &ndash; and lift off. Take enough of a risk that brings you a feeling of energy that was missing previously and not so large of a risk that it shuts you down from even trying.</p><h3> Get Moving</h3><p> <br/> You don&rsquo;t need to pump up the jam and get dancing but you may need to physically move. If every time you sit down to work on your latest challenge you&rsquo;re at your desk, you can find your flow again by making a physical change. Grab your laptop and go to a coffee house, put on your headset and walk around while you take a call, face the window instead of facing the wall&hellip; Physical movement shakes lose psychological blockages too.</p><h3> Work on Your Craft</h3><p> <br/> My son did his dance many, many times before he could simply feel the music and move. You can&rsquo;t expect that the first time you do something you&rsquo;ll be masterful. Every time you do it and work on your craft you&rsquo;ll be able to stretch further. When you&rsquo;re constantly working in a state of conscious incompetence, you&rsquo;re more focused on what you&rsquo;re doing (and totally self-conscious about it!) than immersing yourself in what you&rsquo;re doing. It takes time &ndash; allow yourself to take it.</p><h3> Close Your Eyes</h3><p> <br/> Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and envision yourself doing what you most want to be doing. Now, since this is in your imagination, turn up the volume on what you want it to be, not what you&rsquo;re afraid what will happen. Picture yourself in action with ease, confidence and competence &ndash; and flow.</p><h3> Have Faith and Let Go</h3><p> <br/> When you hold on to ideas of perfectionism, judgment, and worry it&rsquo;s impossible to find your flow. There&rsquo;s no being gentle with you &ndash; until you let go, flow will elude you. Nobody ever wrote a perfect first draft or designed the ideal solution on their first pass.  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/get-unstuck-someday-today/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The key is to get started  </a> </u>  and into action instead of letting your negative and fearful thoughts keep you chained to what is instead of what can be. </p><p> Bottom line: Notice what brings you the most alive and lead (or dance) forward. </p><p> If you meet me on a Just Dance challenge and my eyes are closed, I hope you&rsquo;ll join me and feel the flow.</p><h3> Break the Frame Action: </h3><p> <br/> Ask yourself:</p><p> When was the last time you were so immersed in what you were doing that hours passed like seconds and you were all in?</p><p> <strong>  Do you remember the feeling? What was happening in your body? Your mind? </strong></p><p> How far are you reaching back in your recent memory to find a moment you were in flow?</p><p> If it&rsquo;s been too long since you felt inspired and deeply engaged, it could be time to get unstuck from your current hamster wheel and dance. Check out the  <u>  eCourse Get Unstuck and Choose to Move </u> . Give yourself the gift of five weeks to discover your next step and get into inspired action.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like a little dance break of your own to shake free your gremlins and find your flow, here&rsquo;s my son&rsquo;s favorite song that makes him move. Maybe it will make you want to move too&hellip;</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-31 19:17:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-31 19:17:56.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_hMH6MUT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-find-your-flow-to-create-magic-at-work-and-in-life/\", \"post_id\": \"8942\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-31 19:17:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-31 19:17:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-find-your-flow-to-create-magic-at-work-and-in-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8941\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4249\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Find-Your-Flow-to-Create-Magic-at-Work-and-in-Life.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"626\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454349600,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}

Tax Day looms.</p><h3> Who&rsquo;ll help file your 2015 return?</h3><p> <br/> Every U.S. citizen living and working in this country or abroad must determine the federal income taxes he or she owes, as well as taxes owed to individual states or other local authorities. The deadline to pay those taxes for yearly salary earners falls on April 15 of most years, including 2016. If you pay taxes  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   quarterly  </a> </u> , you face deadlines in April, June, September and January.</p><p> Whichever category you find yourself in year to year, you must choose how to file a tax return before the deadline, as well as which filing status you qualify for. Generally, your choices for filing status are:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Single  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   head of household  </a> </u> , meaning you detail on tax forms onlyyour income, deductions and tax breaks.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Married filing jointly  </a> </u> , meaning you and your spouse report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000220762\" target=\"_blank\">   Married filing separately  </a> </u> , which absolves each of you for the other&rsquo;s possible unintentional omissions or deliberate errors. <br/>  </li><p> Because some filing statuses can be more advantageous for you than others, determine the filing path that best suits your personal and financial situation.</p><p> Next, decide who if anyone will help prepare and file your return. The average fee nationwide for preparing a tax return, including an itemized Internal Revenue Service  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Form 1040  </a> </u>  with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Schedule A  </a> </u>  (for itemized deductions) and a state tax return, is $273 this year, according to a  <u>  survey </u>  by the National Society of Accountants.</p><p> Using a certified public accountant or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kjhfinancialservices.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax preparer  </a> </u>  is a common way to address your tax situation well before a deadline but many people continue to prepare and file  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   federal  </a> </u>  tax returns themselves.</p><p> CPAs versus tax preparers. Even though CPAs and tax preparers may have significant experience in completing and processing tax forms, there are differences between each type of professional.</p><p> CPAs, for example, must undergo rigorous  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aicpa.org/BECOMEACPA/LICENSURE/REQUIREMENTS/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   education  </a> </u>  and certification to become experts in many areas outside of tax preparation, such as accounting matters or other financial services. While you may very well pay more for the services of a CPA than for a non-CPA tax preparer such as an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents\" target=\"_blank\">   enrolled agent  </a> </u>  or a  <u>  registered tax return preparer </u> , the additional cost generally covers the expertise to analyze complex tax situations.</p><p> If you believe your tax situation is relatively straightforward and simple, choosing a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kjhfinancialservices.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tax preparer  </a> </u>  might be a more cost-efficient method to file. Another advantage: These professionals offer you a degree of protection. If one of these professionals makes a clear error or miscalculation on your return, the IRS often holds the preparer accountable before penalizing you.</p><h3> Remember: Booking a professional preparer becomes harder the closer we get to the filing deadline.</h3><p> <br/> Filing yourself. Individual or self-filing can be an option if you want to save money on hiring a CPA or preparer and especially if you&rsquo;re experienced with tax filing. If you make less than $62,000 a year, you can find free forms and other tools on the IRS  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free\" target=\"_blank\">   Free File  </a> </u>  page.</p><p> Several national tax chains, local and national organizations, and even makers of tax software offer free or low-cost preparation services both in-person and online. Online services allow you to enter employment information that generates the necessary documentation needed to file both state and federal income taxes.</p><p> Among those that charge a fee, these alternatives generally cost $12 to $25, depending on the complexity of your return.

{"original_id":4094,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why THESE Messaging Strategies KILL Your Brand (and What to Do Instead)","link":"why-these-messaging-strategies-kill-your-brand-and-what-to-do-instead","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Lately, the practice of sending group messages or tagging people online has gotten out of control.</h3><p> <br/> Marketers and business owners are increasingly going overboard with sending out one message to a whole group or tagging folks in updates that they might like to see.</p><p> But that&rsquo;s the whole point &ndash; updates &ldquo;they might like to see.&rdquo;</p><p> Before I get into why group messaging and group tagging is a buzz kill, and why it&rsquo;s killing your brand &ndash; I want you to know that I am old school. The way I do business is old school. The way I conduct myself in business relationships is old school. &ldquo;My word is my bond&rdquo; old school.</p><p> So how I view this practice is old school.</p><p> And what I mean by that is simply that RESPECT is a part of every strategy I utilize online and in my personal life. I do not believe in tagging someone or messaging them if they did not personally opt in or it doesn&rsquo;t directly relate to them. And I think brands should do the same.</p><p> Why?</p><p> There&rsquo;s several reasons.</p><h3> 1. Lack of personalization.</h3><p> <br/> We are in the midst of the biggest wave of personalized popularity there has ever been online. People want to feel special, to feel unique, and that all the messaging heading their way was tailored to them.</p><p> Remember when email marketing incorporated the ability to insert someone&rsquo;s first name into the header? Like, WOW, right? All of a sudden it looked like your emails were meant for that very specific person when they opened it up.</p><p> And they LOVED it. And why shouldn&rsquo;t they? We all want to feel like our opinion, participation or reference is valuable, and we appreciate it when brands give us that opportunity.</p><h3> 2. It&rsquo;s disrespectful.</h3><p> <br/> If I asked you whether or not you appreciate telemarketing calls, you&rsquo;d probably shake your head side-to-side emphatically. Then you&rsquo;d fill me in on the latest one who called or who had the nerve to call your cellphone.</p><p> Why do we dislike telemarketers so much? Because they invade our personal space. They invade our personal time. And their messages are meant for the masses.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the same with sending group messages or tagging groups of people. It&rsquo;s disrespectful. Thankfully, Facebook now offers the ability to turn it off or untag yourself, but what about on Twitter or Snapchat? There&rsquo;s nothing you can do and that can become maddening.</p><p> It is not a respectful use of someone&rsquo;s time to send them something simply with the hopes of getting more eyeballs on it or pushing your message in front of people it has nothing to do with.</p><p> For example, one of my least favorite ways of group messaging is the dreaded auto DM on Twitter. I don&rsquo;t read my DM&rsquo;s for this reason, but every once in a while I&rsquo;ll see one fly in that says something like &ldquo;Does your business need social media? We can help!&rdquo; blah, blah. And I roll my eyes, make a puking gesture, and unfollow sooo fast. I own a social media marketing agency, why would I need their help!?</p><p> But most importantly, that message isn&rsquo;t for me, doesn&rsquo;t apply to me, and that&rsquo;s irritating.</p><p> Being rude online is something people overlook because they aren&rsquo;t looking at everyone they interact with in the eyes. But we are highly mistaken to ever treat our online audiences as anything but real.</p><p> Online audiences are not just numbers, they are people &ndash; real people just like you and I, and it&rsquo;s time to treat them that way.</p><h3> 3. It makes it hard for the marketing industry.</h3><p> <br/> You know what burns me up the most about these practices are that they ruin it for the rest of us.</p><p> Those of us that want to offer a genuine solution to the customer&rsquo;s problem or need. This inundation of sending out throngs of messages at any and everyone who looks our way only makes it that much harder for the real ones to get through.</p><p> When I first got into sales back in 2003/04, something like that &ndash; I worked for Cingular. My coworkers were a bunch of hoodlums who liked selling people phones they didn&rsquo;t need, adding on features they didn&rsquo;t ask for, and basically doing every unethical thing they could to rack in numbers. I was disgusted and appalled, and didn&rsquo;t think I could make it in that environment.</p><p> But something happened one day. A woman came in who needed help, and I spent time with her finding out what she needed and why. I learned why one device would be better than the other, and which features could make her life easier. I spent too much time with her according to the sales floor standards, but when she walked out I felt amazing because I solved a problem. That was it for me.</p><p> She ended up sending me TONS of referral traffic, and I went from being the newbie salesgirl to being the top salesperson among the three area stores.</p><p> This is a philosophy I have utilize everyday, and it&rsquo;s one that serves me and my clients greatly when growing their brand because we don&rsquo;t take advantage of the relationships built online or the overlook the honor of having a place in their inbox.</p><p> Marketing is marketing, and we all have to make money or want to make money for our clients. But we are only making it harder for ourselves in the long run by pushing the wrong angle in the short run.</p><p> Growing good things takes time.</p><h3> 4. It&rsquo;s the lazy way to create engagement.</h3><p> <br/> It baffles me to get a notification on Facebook that someone has tagged me along with 30+ other people to get an answer to a question or to show off their latest blog. I&rsquo;ve even gotten so irritated that I went to the Facebook parents and told on them.</p><p> Folks, this is a lazy practice. Downright lazy.</p><p> And maybe you don&rsquo;t know that &ndash; in fact, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m guessing.</p><p> You probably say another marketer or business person doing the same, and thought, &ldquo;hey, that&rsquo;s a great idea.&rdquo; And in theory, it is! When it&rsquo;s directed correctly or utilized in the right way, it can be powerful.</p><p> But few to none know how to do that. Instead, whenever they do something new &ndash; they throw in a bunch of names they think might share it or comment, and it becomes a free for all.</p><p> Again, this might work in the SHORT run, but if you&rsquo;re looking to build genuine relationships, if you want to show your audience they can trust you, if you want to be different &ndash; think about from their perspective.</p><p> Stop being a marketer or a business owner for a moment &ndash; throw that mindset AWAY. Look at it from the perspective of the consumer, of the person receiving the message or tag. Would you appreciate it? Would it add value to your life? Would it be worth your time?</p><p> When we focus solely on the dollar bill signs or traffic numbers we forget that our practices might be ones that we wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate either. And that&rsquo;s a PRICELESS viewpoint to take into consideration.</p><h3> 5. It doesn&rsquo;t say much for YOUR brand.</h3><p> <br/> And one of the biggest reasons if not THE biggest is that it reflects poorly on your brand, your integrity, and the credibility of it.</p><p> I received a Snapchat message from someone the other night that said &ldquo;Hey, sorry I don&rsquo;t get a chance to interact personally very often, but I wanted you to know I appreciate you and thanks for following me.&rdquo;</p><p> Guess what? I&rsquo;m not following him.</p><p> FAIL.</p><p> Not only does that make him look like a fool, but it reinforces the reason I unfollowed him to begin with.</p><p> If you want to build a trustworthy, genuine, and human brand &ndash; make sure to infuse everything you do with integrity. And integrity doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of it&rsquo;s online audience or treat them like a big general mass of folks stacked on top of one another.</p><p> Yes, it will take longer to grow an audience. <br/> Yes, it will take more time to cultivate. <br/> Yes, you will need to be patient and go the extra mile.</p><p> BUT it will all be worth it because the audience you grow will love you, look forward to hearing from you, and sound your marketing message across the Internet-scape whenever you ask becauseeeee they know you only ask when it&rsquo;s of value.</p><p> Do NOT go the easy route and focus on numbers or engagement with caddy practices &ndash; have substance, respect, and integrity, and they will fall in love with you.</p><p> Guaranteed.</p><h3> <strong>  HOW? </strong></h3><p> <br/> So now that we&rsquo;ve discuss why you shouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of group messaging or tagging, let&rsquo;s talk about what to do instead because I know you have a brand to grow! I get it.</p><h3> 1. Build brand ambassadors.</h3><p> <br/> Find out who your greatest champions are &ndash; they ones who love your brand, and I mean reallyyyy love your brand, and ask them to partner with you.</p><p> Their audience size is important, but it&rsquo;s not everything. What&rsquo;s most important is that they represent your target audience, the ones you want to bring to your business because it&rsquo;s highly probable they knows others who are also a part of your target audience.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a podcast I won&rsquo;t name who used brand ambassadors to grow the brand. When it first started out, the ambassadors weren&rsquo;t very well known online, and didn&rsquo;t have big audiences. But they loved the podcast and shared it continually when new episodes came out or when the brand shared snippets of the podcast. Fast forward 8 months, and it&rsquo;s becoming a well known podcast for the exact audience it wanted to reach.</p><p> Why? It chose people who are passionate about it and who fit their demographic. Then they partnered up, and worked together.</p><h3> 2. Tag the right people.</h3><p> <br/> If you want to utilize tagging, make sure they are the right people.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t tag people because you want them to see your latest blog or video or whatever. Tag people who are involved, people who are directly partaking in the content.</p><p> And no one else.</p><h3> 3. If you want it shared &ndash; ask.</h3><p> <br/> What happened to being straightforward and asking people to share your content, if that&rsquo;s what you want?</p><p> Be honest, be direct, and ask for the share. BUT before you do, make sure they will find value in what you created, and that it will resonate with their audience.</p><p> Furthermore, I would suggest saying something like &ndash; &ldquo;If you find this to be valuable , please share, I would love your support as I am growing my brand.&rdquo;</p><p> Be human because you&rsquo;re asking a human, and if you ask politely and in a straightforward manner, they&rsquo;re likely to do it with an open heart.</p><p> Finally, and this is a HUGE finally &ndash; make sure YOU are sharing or engaging with their content. If you aren&rsquo;t doing your part to interact and support your community then asking will be tough. Or maybe you don&rsquo;t care and will ask anyway. But the bottom line is that if you are supporting your community then they&rsquo;ll be happy to support you.</p><h3> 4. Utilize private messaging.</h3><p> <br/> Some folks online want to get feedback on new branding or business ideas or possibly just insights on a question they have.</p><p> That&rsquo;s cool.</p><p> What&rsquo;s not cool is tagging a bunch of people to find out who will be looped into the never-ending conversation of that subject and inevitably get irritated with you when you were simply curious and wanted their feedback.</p><p> Hey, I&rsquo;m not dissing you &ndash; you really want to know. But think about others before yourself. Take a step back and narrow down those numbers to a golden few who you know can offer solid feedback, and then message them privately.</p><p> Why? I can guarantee you&rsquo;ll get much better feedback this way.</p><p> Not only will someone feel special because they know their opinion is valuable to you, but in that emotion &ndash; they&rsquo;ll go the extra mile to please you and give you solid insight.</p><p> You&rsquo;re only shorting yourself by going to quantity versus quality &ndash; I promise.</p><h3> 5. Be tactful with group messaging or tagging.</h3><p> <br/> The thing is, group messaging or tagging isn&rsquo;t bad by nature, but the action of how it&rsquo;s used can be detrimental to your brand and even to your friendships if it&rsquo;s not used correctly.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re going to use these practices, make sure you use them in accordance with what I&rsquo;ve outlined above &ndash; to people that are directly involved in the content or who have opted in to be.</p><p> Otherwise, segment out your messaging to be personal to the folks receiving it.</p><p> I promiseeeee you that taking the extra time to nurture your audience, to grow it in a personal manner, and to cultivate trusting relationships will return you wayyyyy more than marketing to the masses ever could.</p><p> Not only because it will give your brand the longevity it needs to sustain, but because you&rsquo;ll know you are treating your audience &ndash; the people who know, love, and trust you &ndash; with respect.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s do marketing right, folks.</p><h3> Your turn:</h3><p> <br/> Disagree? Please share why &ndash; I&rsquo;d love to know.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-01-31 20:31:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-01-31 20:31:17.000000","image_url":"2016/1/article_placeholder_yHkXIZL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-these-messaging-strategies-kill-your-brand-and-what-to-do-instead/\", \"post_id\": \"8944\", \"post_date\": \"2016-01-31 20:31:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-01-31 20:31:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-these-messaging-strategies-kill-your-brand-and-what-to-do-instead\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8941\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4251\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Find-Your-Flow-to-Create-Magic-at-Work-and-in-Life.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"511\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454361300,"author_id":8,"chart_url":""}

At least, not successfully. In fact, many management consulting firms only provide their clients with the blueprint and map for how to accomplish the objectives they defined in the scope. But think about how much an organization can change in a matter of months (or even weeks) &ndash; the time it might take the project to come to completion. While Management Consultants excel in strategy and vision, they are often exceptionally weak at execution and &ldquo;getting the work done&rdquo;. There are many reasons for this: coordination, project management, brand standards, creative&hellip; and the list goes on.</p><p> Management Consultants are right to stick with what they excel at, but they often need a partner to work alongside them in real-time to ensure the work they recommend is actually happening &ndash; and is being measured and improved upon on a regular basis. So what should Management Consultants look for when choosing a digital marketing partner to execute their strategies? Here are  <u>  5 of our top recommendations </u>  for these consultants to keep in mind:</p><h3> Availability</h3><p> <br/> Establish the standards expected before starting with a new partner. How will you be able to communicate? Will you set a daily/weekly touch base meeting to stay aligned? How will they work with your client? Ask how frequently you can expect to hear from your marketing partner.</p><h3> Reporting</h3><p> <br/> Great marketing services should actively work to achieve established goals. Ensure that goals are aligned and that you and your client have access to reports and customizable data to ensure you are obtaining the desired results.</p><h3> Transparency</h3><p> <br/> Avoid agencies that are vague about the services provided or try to conceal their methodology. Ask what specific steps will be taken to improve your marketing campaigns.</p><h3> Data Ownership</h3><p> <br/> When you are ready to leave the agency are you able to take the information with you? If so, how will it be delivered to you? Will you have full ownership, or will your marketing partner also have access?</p><h3> Specialists</h3><p> <br/> There are many different specialties across the world of digital marketing. Just like you wouldn&rsquo;t hire a plumber to fix your car, you may not want a web designer to manage your digital marketing. Digital marketing is a rapidly changing industry. Make sure you are working with a provider who uses the latest marketing technologies.</p><p> Selecting the right digital marketing partner to execute on the plan is crucial for success, and should be done in tandem with the strategy &ndash; not months later.

{"original_id":4096,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Rethinking Succession: The Steps You Need to Take to Get Ready for the Future","link":"rethinking-succession-the-steps-you-need-to-take-to-get-ready-for-the-future","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether an advisor is one among thousands of employees of a wirehouse or is the owner of his own firm, creating a succession plan for the business is likely more of a priority today than a few years ago. Finding the right next generation talent has become an industry-wide challenge, crossing all models and firms. Until recently, advisors were generally confident that at the necessary time (typically in anticipation of retirement), the right heir would be identified, prepared to step in and carry on the business. This, however, is no longer a sure thing, and more importantly, not the ideal solution. The current average age of advisors is now in the mid 50&rsquo;s and every one of them looking for a partner faces increasing competition, with traditional firms and emerging opportunities all vying for a small pool of talent.</p><h3> Succession isn&rsquo;t retirement</h3><p> <br/> The first step to developing a succession plan is to adjust your thinking. Advisors need to think about succession in a different light. Succession is not interchangeable with retirement; it creates continuity for the business enterprise as well as for client relationships. While this plan may anticipate what happens if and when an advisor retires, succession is more accurately about articulating a plan that allows staff and clients to feel secure in the future and is fundamental to acting as a fiduciary. Succession planning also allows a firm to remain relevant to clients&rsquo; next generation and is key to new business development. Having a succession plan in place enhances a firm&rsquo;s value should an acquisition or merger be contemplated.</p><p> The next step is to answer a few key questions to determine just how committed you are to this process.</p><li> What are you willing to do to solve your succession needs-how flexible can you be?</li><li> Your best succession plan may not be something you create; what if it could be found at another firm?</li><li> If you currently own your business, would you trade some of that autonomy to gain an ideal next gen solution?</li><li> If you are currently an employee, would you invest in a junior partner by foregoing some of your own compensation and sharing assets to guarantee an early tenure advisor&rsquo;s immediate success? <br/>  </li><p> Once you&rsquo;ve determined your commitment to the process, it&rsquo;s time to rethink where you are going to find your successor.</p><h3> Home-grown successors                </h3><p> <br/> For many advisors the biggest achievement of their careers is to have a son or daughter decide to follow in their footsteps and come into the business with a view towards eventually taking over. If this is a path you&rsquo;re considering, involve your children in your work early on. Show them the strength and success that comes from building a family business. And certainly don&rsquo;t take for granted that they understand what you do.</p><h3> A succession plan emerges right from your own backyard</h3><p> <br/> Advisors also need to look to their communities &ndash; including spheres of influence and clients &ndash; to uncover potential next-gen talent. It&rsquo;s important to widely communicate your interest in sponsoring an intern, however this must be accompanied by a sincere willingness to introduce them to the business and have them experience your life as a financial advisor.</p><p> Make it known to firm management that you are looking for a successor. This will create a recruiting opportunity for the local branch and asks the manager to be on the lookout within his existing advisory pool.</p><h3> Often it&rsquo;s right in front of you</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t overlook the people you work with every day. Your next-gen talent may very well already be members of your staff or team&mdash;but in non-advisory roles such as client associates or administrative support. Exposing your colleagues to the wealth management side of the business, involving them in the client service and business development processes, and encouraging their ongoing development may allow you to see skills and potential in them that they don&rsquo;t recognize in themselves. Be vigilant &ndash; always on the lookout for talent &ndash; not limiting yourself to traditional sources like your firm&rsquo;s recruiting program, if you&rsquo;re fortunate to have access to one. Regardless, the process for mentoring talent must be clearly defined:</p><li> What is expected of them and how do they achieve the path to partnership?</li><li> What can they expect of you in terms of your time and training? <br/>  </li><h3> Time, money, patience and flexibility required</h3><p> <br/> Development of the next-gen requires an investment of time, money and patience. The perfect readymade, self-sufficient partner with all the necessary experience and clients may not be a realistic expectation. Many advisors spend years fruitlessly waiting for the perfect &ldquo;Mini Me&rdquo; replacement when it may be more productive to adjust expectations.</p><p> A solid 10 years may be necessary for developing someone new to the industry into a legitimate successor. This means that planning ahead is critical. Too few millennials are choosing this path. It&rsquo;s a hard business to get started in; non-solicitation rules, firm account minimums and a more relationship based way of building a book all are creating increasing challenges to new advisors. Training programs have only limited success, as it&rsquo;s difficult to teach the relationship-building qualities that make an advisor successful in today&rsquo;s environment.</p><p> There is much an advisor can do to create a solid succession plan. Recognize that &ldquo;succession planning&rdquo; is less about retirement planning and ideally isn&rsquo;t an emergency exit strategy. Plan far ahead by mentoring quality but inexperienced, raw talent. A willingness to be flexible and open to a variety of sources for talent will increase the odds of finding the right person. Most importantly: start now. The clock is ticking and the future leader of your business may not be ready to stand in your shoes for many years.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 17:09:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 17:09:24.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_7Wi4je5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/rethinking-succession-the-steps-you-need-to-take-to-get-ready-for-the-future/\", \"post_id\": \"8947\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 17:09:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 17:09:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"rethinking-succession-the-steps-you-need-to-take-to-get-ready-for-the-future\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8945\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4253\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Management-Consultants-Can-Find-the-Right-Partner-for-Digital-Marketing-Execution.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"550\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454436060,"author_id":50,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4097,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Increase Brand Awareness With Marketing Videos","link":"how-to-increase-brand-awareness-with-marketing-videos","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/penguinstrategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Idit Lowenstein  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.penguinstrategies.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Penguin Strategies  </u> </a></p><p> So, you&rsquo;re probably asking yourself, what&rsquo;s the importance of marketing videos, and how can they improve brand awareness? It&rsquo;s quite simple- If you&rsquo;re able to hack the viral phenomena, you are in effect growing your brand awareness at lightning speed.</p><p> It&rsquo;s almost incomprehensible that in 24 hours your brand can go from \"zero to hero.\"</p><p> Before I discuss the &ldquo;how&rdquo; behind viral success, you need to understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Why you? Why do some videos catch fire and others remain nameless?</p><p> Based on a  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/09/why-some-videos-go-viral\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study done by Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> , there are two main components to why some videos go viral, and others don&rsquo;t.</p><h3> SOCIAL MOTIVATION:</h3><p> <br/> Research shows that there are 10 motivations for  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.penguinstrategies.com/blog/introduce-instagram-into-your-b2b-marketing-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social sharing  </a> </u> . The most  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/digital-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   successful videos  </a> </u>  should elicit a broad range of motivations. This includes seeking friends approval, wanting to start an online conversation, sharing  <a href=\"https://www.penguinstrategies.com/blog/5-tips-for-curating-content-the-right-way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  useful content </a>  with friends, social expression and much more.</p><p> In today's age, your online presence plays a role in how others perceive you. Therefore, it&rsquo;s crucial to pinpoint your personas, and make content that is in their interest to share.</p><h3> EMOTIONAL RESPONSE:</h3><p> <br/> When people think of emotion, most think that humor is the driving factor for videos to be shared successfully. But it&rsquo;s very tricky to nail, and is culturally sensitive.</p><p> Ever watch a video where you were laughing uncontrollably, and someone else in the room was staring blankly at the screen? Humor is extremely subjective. There&rsquo;s a fine line between hysterical and offensive.</p><p> Since that is the reality, companies should strive to evoke a couple positive responses to make sure that the content you&rsquo;re sharing actually resonates. Don&rsquo;t forget, the more intense the reaction, the better!</p><p> Some emotions you should try to trigger are: happiness, warmth, surprise and hilarity. Stay away from confusion, contempt, disgust, anger and controversy.</p><p> Now, let&rsquo;s get into some practical tips to consider in order to create effective  <u>  <a href=\"/category/sell/digital-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   marketing videos  </a> </u> :</p><h3> ELICIT REACTION</h3><p> <br/> There is an endless amount of information on the internet, but most of it is garbage. Your audience is always searching for valuable, interesting information that will improve their daily tasks.</p><p> If your video is engaging, compelling, and informative, it is also very shareable. Everyone wants to learn something they didn&rsquo;t know, right? That&rsquo;s where your video should come in.</p><p> Wondering how to make your video stand out? It&rsquo;s all about the wow-effect. You want people to walk away thinking: wow, that&rsquo;s cool, I want to learn more. You don&rsquo;t need to have a revolutionary idea to do this. It&rsquo;s all about your presentation.</p><p> The Dollar Shave Club video is a great example of eliciting reaction, with a genius presentation. Their business concept is good, nothing transcendent. But what makes it so clever is how it appeals to the brand&rsquo;s target market so well.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZUG9qYTJMsI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/sell/brand-strategy\"/> </a></p><p> They conducted research, realized their persona, and created an effective video accordingly.</p><h3> KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES</h3><p> <br/> If you want your videos to go viral, it might be time to brush up on current events. By tapping into an existing trend, you can increase the odds that your content will be viewed and shared by people who are already interested in the topic.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/talkingyourtech/2014/03/11/kimmels-secrets-to-a-great-viral-video/6273089/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to USA Today,  </a> </u>  the knowledgeable Jimmy Kimmel wakes up in the morning, checks his email and heads straight to the websites of CNN and MSNBC to &ldquo;see what&rsquo;s happening nationally.&rdquo;</p><p> If you speak the same language as your target audience and present interest in the same topics, they will be a lot more likely to share your content.</p><h3> DON&rsquo;T BE OVERLY PROMOTIONAL</h3><p> <br/> If you create a successful marketing video, it&rsquo;s likely to be the first time many viewers hear about your company. For this reason, it&rsquo;s important that your video oozes your brand&rsquo;s personality without being over promotional.</p><p> You should be informative, comprehensible, and engaging without giving off a &ldquo;hard sell&rdquo;. A good way to do this, is by telling a story. Give viewers enough information about your company, leaving them wanting more.</p><p> Just in case you haven&rsquo;t seen it, here&rsquo;s a great example of a video that was extremely engaging, without being promotional.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ynvKWYvyCqw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-01-at-9.16.22-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/> </a></p><p> This extremely successful video from LG for example, engages viewers and makes them laugh and be amazed at the same time. Only at the end did they deliver the marketing message, but they gave viewers a reason to stay watching until the end by telling a compelling story.</p><p> Next time you&rsquo;re creating marketing videos, try implementing these tips.

You see what you always see&mdash;eyes, nose, mouth, ears. It&rsquo;s normal.</h3><p> <br/> You grab your toothbrush with the same hand every day and brush your teeth. It&rsquo;s normal.</p><p> You select your clothes based on occasion, mood, weather&mdash;and dress in a specific order each time. It&rsquo;s normal.</p><p> When it comes to money, you have a normal too. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it effective, efficient or even appropriate. It&rsquo;s just &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. </p><p> Whether you grab your toothbrush with your right hand or left or put on your socks before your pants is irrelevant to the quality of your life, happiness or success. But how you define your money normal impacts your life in huge ways: your ability to pay your bills, educate your kids, buy a home or retire in comfort and security. </p><p> Some people believe that you save regularly and stay out of debt. Others believe that the future is unknowable, so what the heck? Enjoy today and don&rsquo;t worry about it. We ultimately define our actions based on our habits and what we believe is appropriate or in our best interest.</p><p> Jim grew up in a family that stressed saving money&mdash;it was not to be spent frivolously. When Jim started his first job, he signed up for the company&rsquo;s 401(k) plan and elected to save the maximum allowed; he never gave it a second thought. Saving first and spending what was left was ingrained. Now, as Jim is beginning to think about life after work, he has saved a tidy sum and could choose to stop working now. He has few wants beyond taking care of his family and educating his children. He and Joan love to travel and have found ways to take advantage of great deals and off-peak rates.</p><p> Sam grew up in a family where he was never denied anything he wanted&mdash;his parents lived a lavish lifestyle. They never talked about money, leading Sam to believe that it just arrived to be spent on fun things. When Sam joined the workforce, his only option was an entry level job that didn&rsquo;t pay very well. He wanted to live in a nice neighborhood, in a nice building and enjoy fun times like he had in college. Money was never an issue until his parents informed him that their support was over. Sam used credit cards to try to maintain his lifestyle until the cards were maxed out and he&rsquo;d buried himself in a pretty deep financial hole.</p><p> Both Sam and Jim believed that their approach was normal. And it was, for each of them. But the consequences were very different. It wasn&rsquo;t a matter of wrong or right&mdash;it was simply their normal.</p><p> Sam&rsquo;s realization of the dire situation he was in led him to the discovery that his beliefs were causing pain and suffering. Only through that careful understanding was he able to make shifts in his thinking and behavior that helped him break the cycle of destructive actions into a new normal.</p><h3> What is your &ldquo;normal&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Does it bring you closer to your happiness, satisfaction, comfort and security?

We got used to the way our society has been functioning for decades. A lot of people might not realise that we are transitioning to another phase when it comes to labour. But we definitely are. Will you still be a part of the labour market within 20 years? Than you should start thinking about another career for the future. Or when you are about to start, it&rsquo;s probably best you don&rsquo;t pick these jobs and you choose your education wisely. During an insightful <u> <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mcafee_what_will_future_jobs_look_like?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TED Talk </a></u> McAfee suggested that the increased productivity from sophisticated machine and computing power will lower prices and reduce &ldquo;drudge&rdquo;. Technology  is developing at fast pace and innovative solutions are rapidly integrating in our society&rsquo;s lifestyle. What are the consequences for some jobs within of 20 years from now?<h3> 1. Postal-service worker / mail carrier</h3>Postal services in a lot of countries have a long, glorious history. In the middle part of the 19th century, it offered a stable career with decent pay. And today? Well, now we have e-mail and pick-up and delivery service companies. And services of such kind are increasingly influenced by technology. Take for example the rise of <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Air\" target=\"_blank\">  drone-based delivery </a></u>, that already has been in development by Amazon for a while now. Also the sharing economy brings forth initiatives that are launching delivery solutions, like <u> <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/how-it-works/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  UberRush </a></u>. Your mail or package will soon not be delivered by traditional postal services anymore.<h3> 2. Taxi and delivery drivers</h3>For taxi services there have been developed a bunch of apps for the last couple of years. The taxi fleets big cities used to have are slowly transforming into a herd of private drivers, affiliated with apps like <u> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/21/uber-lyft-helping-hurting-environment-climate-change\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Uber and Lyft </a></u>. However, apps on smart devices aren&rsquo;t the only concern taxi networks face. Also ridesharing apps like Toogethr, the forerunner of ridesharing apps in the Netherlands, are filling transportation gaps. Another example of reducing the need for taxi&rsquo;s are platforms dealing with mobility issues by better linking passengers with transportation options, for example Google Maps and <u> <a href=\"http://www.plannerstack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Plannerstack </a></u>. Before we know it, people transportation and deliveries of packages might soon be carried out by ridesharing, drones and driverless cars.<h3> 3. Newspaper reporter</h3>Every day over a million blog posts are published. This is a huge threat for the future of traditional printed media. Besides that, freelance writers are competing to pitch their stories to top online publishers. Also Careercast included newspaper reporters as a dying breed in its <u> <a href=\"http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/most-endangered-jobs-2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2014 list of the most endangered jobs </a></u>. The jobsite predicted the profession will decline by 13 percent in the coming years as consumers continue to read the news online. Furthermore, news apps are enabling mobile users to catch up on current events while waiting in line or riding public transportation. Advertisers are shifting over to online media as well.<h3> 4. Lumberjack</h3>This is a job we don&rsquo;t have in The Netherlands, but this industry has been providing a lot of people worldwide with jobs. As we are gradually shifting towards a greener and more sustainable environment, we are replacing paper products for digital ones. In the US the lumberjack has been marked as <u> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-that-are-quickly-disappearing-2014-7?op=1&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  one of the disappearing jobs </a></u>. At a certain stage, I believe all comparable manual labour will be replaced by advanced technologies and due to more sustainable solutions.<h3> 5. Librarian</h3>Fact: librarians can be very helpful. If you ever written a research paper, you probably discovered their added value. How easy it is for them to manage and navigate around the gigantic library collection is amazing. They point you to the correct source and provide great complementary ideas. Another fact: Librarians are becoming too expensive. They work &lsquo;limited&rsquo; hours, while online library services are open 24/7. Besides that, are they as fast and effective as a search engine? Unfortunately not. Therefore, universities and public libraries are moving their library services to online platforms.<h3> 6. Teachers</h3>Teachers likely to disappear? Yes indeed, some of them. They are unlikely to become fully extinct, but a lot is changing in the educational systems. Online learning is causing a true revolution in teaching models. Online learning platforms like MOOCs and SPOCs are popping up like flowers in the spring. For example, MIT currently offers over 2000 courses online. In the future, I expect there will be fewer teachers and professors and more coaches, course designers and learning camps. It&rsquo;s not that there will be less teaching jobs, but it&rsquo;s about fulfilling a new need in the market.<h3> 7. Travel Agents</h3>Savvy sites that allow you to book your own vacation by using booking websites such as Kayak, Couchsurfing and Airbnb. They are ultimate answer for mobile users who prefer speed over personal service. Staff.com co-founder Rob Rawson wrote in <u> <a href=\"http://www.staff.com/blog/losing-your-job-to-technology-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  his blog </a></u> that websites provide a custom-made service that rivals even the most efficient human travel agent. So, do we really still need a dedicated travel agent to purchase your air fare or plan an itinerary? With Bing Travel, Google Flights and quite a collection of other flight-search engines, finding cheap tickets and booking low-prized rooms is becoming very easy. What do you think the chances are that we&rsquo;ll still see this profession within 10 years?<h3> 8. Air Traffic Controllers and Pilots</h3>Technology is already heading towards intelligent automation in air traffic. John L. Petersen, pilot and opinion leader, <u> wrote</u> that drones and other unmanned carriers will become part of the global aircraft fleet, due to the combination of ubiquitous connectivity, increasing bandwidth, advanced sensors and decreasing cost. Doing research and collecting information for weather and flight plans will be taken over by artificial intelligence agents. This will cause less need for traditional pilots and traffic controllers.<h3> 9. Farmers</h3>As things get more and more automated, the less people will be needed to run things manually. This means no agricultural workers that need to be walking up and down the fields to pick plants. Technology is becoming increasingly efficient. A massive autonomous machine will pick plants or sow faster. Also cheaper compared to paying a complete workforce. Soon one or two people can run an entire farm. A new era for agriculture.<h3> 10. Cashiers</h3>Self-checkouts in stores or at gas stations are becoming a commonness in the payment landscape. Mostly it&rsquo;s faster for the customer and cheaper for the store owner. Although today&rsquo;s technology is often still requiring people to individually have their items scanned by a human, I expect that in the future you&rsquo;ll even be able to put all your items in the cart and walk out of the store without passing a cash register. A smart scanner will probably scan all the items within seconds and charge your account. Really convenient, except when security measures prevent you from leaving due to insufficient funds&hellip;Next to these 10 jobs there will be a lot more jobs that will change drastically or disappear.

And in doing so, they can begin to believe that eventually, the tide will turn and the positive days begin to outnumber the negative.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also during the hopeful and promising times that a person starts to have a mind shift from &lsquo;we&rsquo; to &lsquo;me.&rsquo; This is captured by feeling hopeful about their future, envisioning what they want their new life to look like through fantasies and visualization, and how they might create a better future &ndash; one that is filled possibilities! The possibility of love again, a healthy relationship, a life of solitude, or stronger family and friendships. Whatever one envisions, it is theirs to create!</p><p> However, its quite common that in the early days of divorce, moving on, finding love, and feeling like you will ever recover are almost non-existent.

{"original_id":4101,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Become Wildly Successful Without Spending A Dime","link":"how-to-become-wildly-successful-without-spending-a-dime","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of my closest friends loves to complain about her job. She&rsquo;s bright, creative, and could get a job anywhere if she were willing to complain less and apply more.  So I was surprised to hear that when she received an exciting new offer, she turned it down. In a less-than-successful attempt to take my coach hat off and put my friend hat on, I asked, &ldquo;How did you make that decision?&rdquo; She told me that after talking to her parents and boyfriend, she decided it was best to stay put. It occurred to me that her staying at her job meant I was destined for a lifetime of tortured text messages. And then, in an empathetic flash, it hit me:</p><h3> Wasn&rsquo;t I guilty of making decisions that derailed me?</h3><p> <br/> Hadn&rsquo;t I turned to the people closest to me for advice whether or not they knew what they were talking about?</p><p> Before I had a mentor, hadn&rsquo;t I been like everyone else who made important decisions in isolation or by crowd-sourcing answers from friends, family, and Facebook?</p><h3> So what changed?</h3><p> <br/> One day after a frustrating conversation with a loved one, I realized that every time I can came to her, I either felt misunderstood, disappointed, or I had received crappy advice. And since I couldn&rsquo;t change what came out of her mouth, I accepted that I needed to change my behavior. It was then that I vowed to only ask for advice from people who have what I want. But since Oprah wouldn&rsquo;t take my calls, I decided that I needed to create a cabinet of trusted advisors. Because if the president has a team of go-to people, I should, too. </p><p> I needed a team of mentors who not only had what I wanted, but were willing to guide me. But before I could research, network, or contact anyone, I needed to get super clear on what I wanted (lest I set myself or another up for disappointment) &ldquo;Mentorship&rdquo; is a word that gets thrown around quite a bit. It isn&rsquo;t a term for just anyone you go to for advice or support. A mentor is a well-connected, trusted, experienced, supportive, wise advisor. Most importantly, a mentor is someone who believes in your highest vision of yourself. It isn&rsquo;t your parents, friends, or bed-fellows. While these people love and support you, they are not always the best sources of advice.Because convenience is not the same as competence. </p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re young, old, aimless, or well-established, everyone can benefit from the wisdom and guidance of someone who&rsquo;s been in their shoes. Even Oprah credits her success to her mentor, Maya Angelou. (Not too shabby!)</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;A lot of people have gone further in life than they thought they could because someone else thought they could.&rdquo; &mdash; Zig Ziglar </strong></p><p> Because here&rsquo;s the simple truth nobody talks about: None of us would be where we are without the support and guidance of someone further on their journey. My mentor has helped me by providing concrete knowledge, honest feedback, and new opportunities.</p><p> Many people ask, why would anyone want to be my mentor? The relationship benefits everyone. For example, the mentor gets the tingly feeling of gratitude for helping another, gains a new perspective, and builds on her network of like-minded people. However, not everyone is ready to be mentored or be a mentor. So think carefully and choose wisely.</p><h3> IF YOU&rsquo;RE SEEKING A MENTOR, MAKE SURE YOU ARE: <br/>  </h3><li> Committed to becoming your best self</li><li> Willing to communicate openly</li><li> Ready to look at yourself honestly</li><li> Consistent and reliable</li><li> Capable of follow-through</li><li> Have clear goals or are willing to set goals</li><li> Willing to receive feedback <br/>  </li><h3> IF YOU&rsquo;RE SEEKING A MENTEE, MAKE SURE YOU ARE: <br/>  </h3><li> Generous and patient</li><li> An excellent communicator</li><li> Interested in sharing your knowledge and experience with others</li><li> Clear on your values</li><li> Honest and have integrity</li><li> Willing to share your network</li><li> Able to enhance someone&rsquo;s self-esteem</li><li> Able to provide emotional and professional support</li><li> Able to act as a role model</li><li> Passionate about teaching <br/>  </li><p> The mentor and mentee should have a clear conversation to ensure they have similar goals, values, and a vision for what the relationship will look like.</p><p> For those seeking support who need accountability, consistent communication, or motivation, mentorship may not provide you with the relationship or results that you want. And that&rsquo;s okay! Find an accountability buddy or coach who will provide the structure you need to set you up for success. Once that&rsquo;s in place, you&rsquo;ll have the personal systems you need to make the most of a mentoring partnership.</p><h3> THE TAKEAWAY:</h3><p> <br/> When seeking guidance, don&rsquo;t sacrifice competence for convenience. Find mentors who will guide and support your journey.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 17:35:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 17:35:54.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_T6RgM7Z.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-become-wildly-successful-without-spending-a-dime/\", \"post_id\": \"8958\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 17:35:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 17:35:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-become-wildly-successful-without-spending-a-dime\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8957\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4258\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Become-Wildly-Successful-Without-Spending-A-Dime.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"866\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454439600,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4102,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What the Chinese Zodiac Can Teach Us About Personal Finance","link":"what-the-chinese-zodiac-can-teach-us-about-personal-finance","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It's the Year of the Monkey. Here are some lessons we can learn from this charming and energetic creature.</h3><p> <br/> One of the most exciting aspects about being multicultural is that the New Year celebration does not end on January 1.  According to the Western calendar, February 8, 2016 marks the beginning of the Chinese New Year&mdash;also known as &ldquo;Spring Festival,&rdquo; the longest and most important celebration for Chinese families across the globe.</p><p> Because the Chinese calendar is lunisolar, meaning it is based on both lunar and solar cycles, it is celebrated on a different date each year. The lunar calendar also defines the 12-year repeating cycle of Chinese zodiac with each year named after an animal. 2016 is the Year of the Monkey. Charming and energetic, monkeys are definitely party animals because they crave fun, activity and excitement.</p><p> <strong>  What can monkeys teach us about finance? </strong></p><h3> 1. Lose the financial fat.</h3><p> <br/> The cost of living continues to increase, and it is hard to stay on a strict money diet. Start off easy, but stop going bananas on items that you could do without, such as premium cable or the fanciest tech gadgets. Cable bills vary depending on provider and services; most bills run a few hundred a month. But technology now allows people to view television online, and Netflix provides ample opportunity to binge watch at a monthly cost that in many instances is lower than cable.</p><p> <strong>  Try This: </strong> Be a creative primate and analyze your spending habits to find ways to save. Next, take those savings and invest for your future. For example, prepare your own lunch from home, resist the urge to shop when you&rsquo;re bored,  or  upgrade your phone when the latest model hits the shelves.  Redirect your &ldquo;found&rdquo; money to your Roth IRA or 401(k) to build wealth for your financial independence.</p><h3> 2. Respect your wallet.</h3><p> <br/> Many of us are prone to reaching for the credit card instead of using cash. That&rsquo;s like throwing a monkey wrench into your budgeting. It is easy to lose track of our spending because we don&rsquo;t realize how frequently we swipe when a credit card is so readily available and accessible. To our shock and horror, we soon discover how much we really spent during the course of the month when our statement arrives. Interest rates and credit card fees accumulate, and soon we are in debt over our heads. This is an example of compound interest working against us!</p><p> <strong>  Try This: </strong>  Only have one extra credit card for emergency uses only. Determine what truly constitutes an emergency; such as health care expenses, car repairs, or utilities. Place the card in a secure place and let a trusted person know where it is located.</p><h3> 3. Gifts should come from the heart.</h3><p> <br/> Dao De Jing or Tao Te Ching, the inspirational &ldquo;old master&rdquo; texts of ancient China, state that the greatest resources a person can have are love, generosity and frugality. It feels better to create a homemade gift than spend tons of money. Think of the return on investment: a few dollars to make something means more to the person because thought went into it.</p><p> <strong>  Try This: </strong> Donating money in someone&rsquo;s name is a way to make both you and the gift recipient feel as though you are supporting a worthy cause.</p><h3> 4. Leave the ego at the door.  </h3><p> <br/> According to the Chinese Zodiac, the weaknesses of the monkey are being egotistical, arrogant, crafty, restless and snobbish. These negative characteristics may cost anyone financial success. There is no harm in seeking help from an expert. Ego often clouds judgment and choices, leaving a person with a less than ideal outcome.</p><p> <strong>  Try This: </strong> Consult with a financial adviser when dealing with serious financial matters; such as preparing for retirement, going through a divorce or becoming a caregiver to an aging parent. An expert is unbiased and doesn&rsquo;t have that strong emotional connection to the situation. By talking with an adviser, you may glean financial confidence. It&rsquo;s like getting a monkey off your back.</p><p> To derive the greatest benefit from the Year of the Monkey, plan to use your talents wisely.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t fritter away the opportunity that the beginning of a new year gives us to plan. What you write down now, you can make come true. Time to stop monkeying around.  Time to establish your financial goals.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 17:41:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 17:41:01.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_RV5UwEx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-the-chinese-zodiac-can-teach-us-about-personal-finance/\", \"post_id\": \"8960\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 17:41:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 17:41:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-the-chinese-zodiac-can-teach-us-about-personal-finance\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8959\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4259\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-the-Chinese-Zodiac-Can-Teach-Us-About-Personal-Finance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"801\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454415300,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}

List all of the keywords that motivate you to return time after time. Many of the adjectives also apply to the qualities sought in job applicants while on interviews.</p><h3> My Story</h3><p> <br/> In the early days of corporate sales, the only instruction I received was, &ldquo;People buy from people they know, like and trust&rdquo;. It became my mantra to learn how to accomplish this.</p><h3> Emotional Need Met</h3><p> <br/> The personal conversation saved the day and my job. Inclusion of the emotional aspect earned many appointments. It became evident the person needed to pick a trustworthy vendor to provide what was needed, wanted and deeply desired.</p><h3> Website / Profile</h3><p> <br/> In order for prospects to consider you, your contact information must be easily found. Social media connection links are an excellent idea to increase prospective audiences, and the copy should be succinct and easy to read.</p><h3> Value</h3><p> <br/> In addition to empathy being built at the start, value is to also be built. Acknowledge the research you did and which aspect of the prospect&rsquo;s business intrigues you most. This shows you are willing to work for the sale and earn their trust.</p><h3> Differentiate</h3><p> <br/> Establishing your unique brand will build further value and interest. Prospective clients want to know the advantages of how you deliver service. Without bad-mouthing the competition, you are able to put a question mark in the client&rsquo;s mind.</p><h3> Checklist</h3><p> <br/> Asking for a checklist of what is required to earn the sale, demonstrates you will work on the behalf of the client. Beware though, this sometimes prompts a test from your prospective client.</p><h3> The Test</h3><p> <br/> Frequently prospective clients will ask you to research something to help them make the right decision. It can be time-consuming and annoying. But the only thing you can be certain of, is, if you don&rsquo;t produce what was requested, you will not get the sale.</p><h3> Excellence</h3><p> <br/> Listening and clarifying everything that is shared puts you in first place. And delivering upon everything promised will produce very happy and loyal clients.</p><h3> Follow-up</h3><p> <br/> After the sale is completed, check in to earn a gold star from for your client and solidify the relationship.

This new post examines the survey data to answer the question: What percentage of investment adviser firms outsource client portfolio management?</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/ctas/v2/public/cs/c/?cta_guid=65088cf0-6ebd-4643-87ea-cdb44c4705d3&amp;placement_guid=d9666b6c-d5ff-4614-af26-a5999555a01b&amp;portal_id=305003&amp;redirect_url=APefjpERSelBrRc-GHCZznkDVi_GQf8039nLU4wSn-E7OAgUfi47kWKlpI4Mgx4e7bIHSk5_pclLGL9wDdm_uINkfViZ5M0jd0btZiTLXqCwdkvejTQqJFuS1N4RX5WThzRSIGaztR3c-9DRSS4S7wVv9d8-_JMuXmMtqvg92NWU0E9ntXnn91l6V79gxWhyGwjuE6HBY0fLwSAp3MAnvQPWds2qA4rtQf_ENhWR9PawqnlQ5dKrLO_QZWNg76uVeR7kWSaSSdBUxMVJgsEDKVA6sISbZI1hbYQze9kiIeePHBVXMCWzIsb8fJItEGcQoUx07aW3uwVBHBJbr2I5rxm9bHJEOZnh5Q&amp;hsutk=26395e11ae08364656fb6b372f69ab78&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fwhat-percentage-of-ria-firms-outsource-client-portfolio-management&amp;canon=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.riainabox.com%2Fblog%2Fwhat-percentage-of-ria-firms-outsource-client-portfolio-management&amp;pageId=3969207745\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Download our 2015 RIA Technology Landscape Infographic  </a> </u></p><p> The chart below indicates the percentage of investment advisory firms in 2014 compared to 2013 that manage portfolios internally or \"in-house\" across different  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-to-calculate-investment-adviser-regulatory-assets-under-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   assets under management (AUM)  </a> </u>  segments:</p><p> <img alt=\"Percentage of RIA Firms that Outsource Portfolio Management\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hubfs/RIAManagePortfoliosInternallyByAUM.jpg?t=1454098663265\"/></p><p> As illustrated in the chart above, our two most recent survey results both indicate that overall, 82% of RIA firms manage client investment portfolios internally. On the other hand, 18% of investment advisory firms are utilizing a third party to outsource client investment management. The responses also indicate that firms with less than $50 million in AUM are more likely to outsource asset management. The fact that smaller firms are more frequently using a third party asset manager makes intuitive sense given that such firms may feel that they do not have the internal resources to focus on portfolio management.</p><p> When outsourcing portfolio management, firms are often using a turn key asset management platform (TAMP). These platforms fall into many categories and include traditional providers that may provide access to a unique investment platform such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://us.dimensional.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) mutual funds  </a> </u>  or the newer breed of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-guide-to-online-rias-and-robo-advisors-that-serve-ria-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   automated investment platforms  </a> </u>  that are beginning to serve RIA firms. In addition, there are also a growing number of larger, traditional investment advisory firms that now offer these services to smaller firms.</p><h3> RIA Firms Outsourcing Investment Management Based on Year of Establishment</h3><p> <br/> The chart below looks at the percentage of firms first registered in a given year that are managing client portfolios in-house versus outsourcing to a third party firm:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA firms more recently established are using third party asset managements\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RIAFirmsOutsourcingInvestmentManagementByYear-1.jpg?t=1454098663265&amp;width=612\"/></p><p> The chart above reveals that firms most recently registered in 2014 are outsourcing investment management much more frequently compared to firms established in prior years. 30% of firms started in 2014 are outsourcing portfolio management compared to 18% of firms overall. It will be interesting to look at the results of this year's upcoming survey to see if this recent uptick holds steady or begins to decline as newer upstarts gather additional assets. In general, we see a growing number of attractive third party outsourcing options and suspect that the recent shift towards newly formed firms more frequently using a third party money management firm will continue.</p><h3> RIA Firms that use Passive Investment Management are more likely to Outsource Portfolio Management</h3><p> <br/> The graphic below illustrates that firms that use a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/more-ria-firms-are-utilizing-passive-and-active-portfolio-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   passive investment management style  </a> </u>  are more likely to outsource the portfolio management function compared to firms that use an active investment management style:</p><p> <img alt=\"37% of RIA firms that use passive investment management outsource portfolio management\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hubfs/RIAOutsourceInvestmentManagementStyle.jpg?t=1454098663265\"/></p><p> There is quite a significant gap in the frequency of portfolio management outsourcing when looking at passive versus active investment management styles. To provide some perspective,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/more-ria-firms-are-utilizing-passive-and-active-portfolio-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our earlier analysis on the percentage of investment adviser firms managing portfolios passively vs. actively  </a> </u>  revealed the following results when looking at all firms regardless of AUM:</p><li> Exclusively Active: 43%</li><li> Exclusively Passive: 19%</li><li> Both Active and Passive (Hybrid): 37% <br/>  </li><p> However, each year our survey continues to reveal a rising number of firms using an exclusively passive portfolio management style. If that trend sustains itself in future years, it's possible that there will also be a coinciding steady increase in the number of RIA firms using a third party platform to manage investment portfolios. In general, it seems logical that firms with a bias towards passive investment management are more likely to outsource investment management given that such firms are often more focused on holistic wealth management rather than marketing client portfolio returns that \"beat the market.\" This assumption is explored a bit further in the next depiction.</p><h3> RIA Firms that Outsource Client Portfolio Management are more likely to offer Financial Planning</h3><p> <br/> As the graphic shows below, advisory firms that use a third party asset management firm are much more likely to offer financial planning services:</p><p> <img alt=\"RIA firms that outsource investment management are more likely to offer financial planning\" src=\"http://www.riainabox.com/hubfs/RIAFirmsFinancialPlanningOutsourcePortfolioManagement.jpg?t=1454098663265\"/></p><p> In general, our studies have continually revealed that firms that use a passive portfolio management style are more commonly also offering financial planning services. As such, the above graphic coincides with these previous findings and continues to articulate that the advisory firm characteristics of managing portfolios passively, using a third party asset management firm, and offering financial planning services are highly correlated. It should also be noted that our analysis has also consistently revealed that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-firms-that-offer-financial-planning-are-surviving-and-thriving\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA firms that offer financial planning services appear to more frequently succeed compared to firms that do no not  </a> </u> .  </p><h3> What types of RIA Firms should consider using a Third Party Investment Management Firm?</h3><p> <br/> As our survey results revealed, outsourcing portfolio management can often be an attractive option for smaller or even larger investment advisory firms that may not have the internal resources or desire to manage client portfolios in-house. When considering whether the third party asset management option makes sense, firms should consider these key questions:</p><li> Do I feel that my firm is capable of delivering a professional investment management experience?</li><li> What are the total costs of the in-house vs. third party options for my clients and for my firm?</li><li> Does my firm's investment philosophy properly align with the third party firm?</li><li> Does the third party firm offer any other type of practice management or technology support in addition to portfolio management?</li><li> What types of interactions will this third party firm have with my firm's clients? <br/>  </li><p> In addition, it is very important that advisory firms perform the proper due diligence on third party asset management firms from a compliance and information security perspective given that the third party firm will likely have access to non-public private client information.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 18:00:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 18:00:36.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_UovTfzp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-percentage-of-ria-firms-outsource-client-portfolio-management/\", \"post_id\": \"8963\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 18:00:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 18:00:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-percentage-of-ria-firms-outsource-client-portfolio-management\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8959\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4262\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-the-Chinese-Zodiac-Can-Teach-Us-About-Personal-Finance.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1168\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454409900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

And this makes him a key member of the global financial establishment.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s not too often that central bankers are particularly transparent with the public.</h3><p> <br/> Ben Bernanke famously told the world in July 2005 that there wouldn&rsquo;t be a nationwide decline in home prices in the United States.</p><p> Then just a few months later when home prices did fall, he told Congress that the adverse effects of the housing market were &lsquo;contained&rsquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t affect the broader economy.</p><p> He was dead wrong on both accounts. And one of the biggest financial crises in history broke out shortly thereafter.</p><p> Central bankers seem to always miss the crisis just around the corner.</p><p> That&rsquo;s pretty scary given that they have the power to dominate and control just about everything in the entire economy.</p><p> And despite a serial track record of failure, we&rsquo;re just supposed to trust them to be smart guys. It&rsquo;s madness.</p><p> A few days ago, however, William White gave an interview stating some things that you never hear coming out of the mouth of a central banker. Ever.</p><h3> According to White, the global financial system is dangerously unstable.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;The situation is worse than in 2007,&rdquo; he said, and went on to explain that central banks no longer have the ammunition to fight off a major crisis.</p><p> He railed against the mountain of government debt that has accumulated worldwide, saying that &ldquo;it will be obvious in the next recession that many of these debts will never be serviced or repaid.&rdquo;</p><p> White also suggested that banks, particularly in Europe, will have to be recapitalized on an unimaginable scale.</p><p> And due to all the new regulations, it will be depositors who have portions of their accounts confiscated by the state in order to fund the bank bailouts.</p><h3> William White is not alone.</h3><p> <br/> Michael Bury, the man who made $100 million betting against the last housing crisis, sees the same thing.</p><p> In an interview last month, Bury spoke about the &ldquo;absurdity&rdquo; of the massive level of debt in the system, and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s pitiful balance sheet.</p><p> When he gave the interview, the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet was leveraged 77:1. Today, barely a month later, it&rsquo;s over 100:1. Incredible.</p><p> Financial markets have been in panic mode since the beginning of the year.</p><p> Just in the first few weeks of January, US stocks are down more than 10%. In China, the epicenter of the chaos, stocks are down 20%.</p><h3> Commodity prices continue to fall. Pessimism abounds.</h3><p> <br/> Look, maybe this is it. Maybe the global financial system has truly reached its limit.</p><p> Maybe the world has realized that the path to prosperity is not in conjuring money out of thin air, raising taxes, or going deeper into debt.</p><p> Maybe people have finally figured out that an insolvent government and insolvent central bank cannot possibly continue to underpin the entire financial system.</p><h3> Or maybe not.</h3><p> <br/> Maybe this will all be forgotten in a few weeks. And this coming Christmas no one will remember the great crisis of January that almost was.</p><p> But to me the incredible thing is how much panic there has been, particularly in banking and financial markets, just at the mere HINT of problems in the system.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a clear indication of how quickly people can lose confidence and an entire system can become unglued.</p><p> Maybe things drag on like this for years, with government continuing to pile up debt and central banks continuing their slide into insolvency.</p><p> Maybe interest rates can become even more negative, and banks can become even less liquid.</p><p> But one day that confidence will turn. And as this month shows, it can all happen in an instant.</p><h3> Look, I&rsquo;m an optimistic guy.</h3><p> <br/> Crisis always brings opportunity for those who can see the obvious realities.

{"original_id":4107,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Three Deal Breakers for Hiring","link":"three-deal-breakers-for-hiring","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a 25 year plus veteran in the industry, I am a big believer that hiring is one of the most important things you can do in your business.  Having practice and discipline around who you hire and why can make a big impact on your success.  The hardest part of interviewing is that there are many ways to game an interview.  Some people exude confidence which can be misconstrued for the success in practice you are seeking.  Develop your own competencies where you will not compromise. </p><p> I have three deal breakers that I look for when hiring talent.  You should develop your own but this may be a start when considering business development people for your practice.  Below are my main criterial with some suggestions for your consideration that could help identify the right person. </p><h3> #1  Integrity</h3><p> <br/> Integrity is one of the hardest things to discover in the interview process.  In a regulatory driven world, You want your team members to want to do the right thing when nobody is looking.</p><p> <strong>  Intro questions </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Tell me about a time in your life where you overcame something difficult&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How do you view your responsibility in this role?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Harder questions </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Give me an example where you didn&rsquo;t agree with your boss-  what did you do?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What do you think of the current regulatory environment?&rdquo;</p><h3> # 2  Drive</h3><p> <br/> In a sales environment, we face rejection daily.  Many people romanticize a sales job because &ldquo;they like to help people&rdquo;.  The reality is, in a pure business development sense you need to create urgency where none exists.  The candidate needs to be able to face rejection regularly and be self motivational.</p><p> <strong>  Intro questions </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Besides relationships, what do you like about this business?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;When are you most successful? And why?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Harder questions </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Tell me about a time when you failed?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;What was your longest sales (cycle/time) win and what did you do to close it?&rdquo;</p><h3> #3  Execution</h3><p> <br/> In an industry where you need to have intelligent people face off with practice owners, clients and savvy investors you need to have intelligent investment experts. </p><p> Additionally, you need someone who courageously assess the situation is able to move the process forward and close business.  Finding the right person with the necessary balance of both competencies is difficult to do. </p><p> If the person is to analytical, you can experience &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo; where they overthink what needs to be done and over prep for sales. </p><p> If the person is too salesy, they may tend to underprepare or &ldquo;shoot from the hip&rdquo;.  The could come off as disingenuous in the sales process. </p><p> <strong>  Intro questions </strong></p><p> &ldquo;How do you assess whether someone is a good prospect?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Harder questions </strong></p><p> &ldquo;How do you manage the sales process?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;How do you define your pipeline, and when do you know when to advance them in the process?&rdquo;</p><h3> While there is no silver bullet with questions, you need to trust your gut on the candidates response. </h3><p> <br/> Do they look you in the eye?  Are they nervous?  What is their body language saying?</p><p> Remember, if your instinct tells you to be hesitant, there is probably good reason and you need to spend more time uncovering the issues.  While no candidate is perfect, the perfect situation is one where you as the manager fully understand the candidates strengths and weaknesses, and are confident that you can coach them to success. </p><p> For more information about Flex Shares visit us <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-3-deal-breakers-hiring-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 18:14:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 18:14:53.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_f7oKKHY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/three-deal-breakers-for-hiring/\", \"post_id\": \"8967\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 18:14:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 18:14:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"three-deal-breakers-for-hiring\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8966\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4264\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Three-Deal-Breakers-for-Hiring.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"682\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454482860,"author_id":323,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4108,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Best Practices of the Best Advisors","link":"best-practices-of-the-best-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a young hockey player growing up, we all wanted to be our best. We defined the best at that time as the &ldquo;Great One&rdquo; Wayne Gretzky. As we studied and watched Wayne weave his magic, we realized that he plays a different style of game, which is not for everyone. Wayne and his team had an offensively aggressive style of play that worked well for them and led them to 5 Stanley Cups.</p><p> But not every team that played that style, had success. Understanding your team your business model and the style that you have success with, does not work for everyone. Be careful of the trap of following other successful advisors and expecting similar results. In business it does not work that way.</p><p> Wayne Gretzky had unique abilities that contribute to the overall team success. I will repeat myself &ldquo;the hardest part is knowing yourself and understanding what success triggers work in your business.\"</p><h3> Here are some success triggers that work for top advisors.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First, they have an ideal client profile, meaning they know where they want to spend 70% or more of their time and enjoy working with this group of people. </strong> Defining an ideal client, age status income and net worth is important but the critical key is the annual recurring revenue that you generate to help them reach their goals. What is the annual recurring revenue you want to generate for your ideal client? Is it $3000, $5000 or $10,000 or more per year? Top advisors who have the processes to deliver the most comprehensive financial services command the highest fees, and are the most valuable to their clients. So the question is, how can you become more valuable?</p><p> <strong>  The second key that top advisors do is understand the difference between ideal client and non-ideal client. </strong> Everyone deserves service, but not everyone deserves the same level of service, so top advisor segment their client base.</p><p> According to Business Health Pty Ltd., advisors in the United States that segment their clients earn 33% more than advisors who don&rsquo;t segment (Source Business Health Pty Ltd. 2014 US Advisors Key Value Drivers USA* The Value of Practice Management). The question is, how many ideal clients can you manage in a calendar year? The second question is how do you manage or service non-ideal clients?</p><h3> Make more time</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  How can you have more time to attract and service more ideal clients? </strong> Know the time you spend with ideal clients and non-ideal clients. When I was an advisor, I would look back at last year&rsquo;s calendar and figure out three critical numbers. First the total hours I worked in a year, which was approximately 2000 or 45 weeks and 45 hours per week.</p><p> Next I would look at the total number of appointments for ideal clients and non-ideal clients. Then I would add up the hours and plan out what I wanted to do the next year. Then I would look at how I can find time to attract and service more ideal clients year after year. The math was amazing, the more I spent with ideal clients, the better I felt the better they felt and the more my business would grow. I never felt guilty about not servicing non ideal clients enough, but always felt guilty about not seeing ideal clients enough.</p><p> According to Business Health, only 38% of advisors contact their &ldquo;A&rdquo; or ideal clients more than 10 times per year. (Source Business Health Pty Ltd. 2014 US Advisors Key Value Drivers USA* the Value of Practice Management). It is fair to say that some &ldquo;A&rdquo; clients are being underserved. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to find them!</p><h3> What is your ideal lifestyle?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  When planning your year for 2016, did it start with your lifestyle first? </strong> Top advisors know they need to take breaks and recharge in order to be successful. Taking time off makes you more successful. Did you plan out your lifestyle first, then the business or is it the other way around? If I make x amount of money then I will have the lifestyle I want. You cannot delegate lifestyle. You cannot delegate family time and you cannot delegate exercise.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.billbachrach.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bill Bachrach  </u> </a> taught me that you need to live life on purpose. It is the pay yourself first philosophy, if you invest in yourself, lifestyle education etc., then you can help others. The three metrics to measure the best advisors are</p><li> <strong>  The value delivered to their clients through their value proposition. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Financial success they personally have. Their own financial plan works and their financial house is in order </strong></li><li> <strong>  They have a quality of life which other aspire to and not a workaholic. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Success leaves clues, and find someone who has the ideal lifestyle the ideal business model that could work for you and ultimately the ideal client list that gives them the greatest satisfaction. Make 2016 a great year!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 18:31:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 18:31:47.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_i9TlZop.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/best-practices-of-the-best-advisors/\", \"post_id\": \"8968\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 18:31:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 18:31:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"best-practices-of-the-best-advisors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8966\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4265\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Three-Deal-Breakers-for-Hiring.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"410\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454409000,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4110,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Will It Cost If You Have To Financially Support Your Aging Parents?","link":"what-will-it-cost-if-you-have-to-financially-support-your-aging-parents","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When meeting with a group of young business owners and CEOs recently, Mikol and I were were amazed that these folks were so forward thinking about their parents. </h3><p> <br/> We had been invited to come and discuss a variety of issues they saw in planning for their parents&rsquo; futures. All are 40 years old or younger.  With their own thriving businesses, they felt responsibility to share with parents who were probably going to be depending on them or already were doing so. Their foresight is likely related to their business success as well.</p><p> The cost of long term care arose.  What if you have to pay for them to get the care they need later on, even if they don&rsquo;t need it yet?  How much should a person set aside?</p><p> Some had purchased long term care insurance for a parent and we were happy to see that good planning.  Others figured they&rsquo;d have to pay out of pocket when the need arose.</p><p> While only about a third of aging folks believe they will indeed need long term care, the fact is that about two-thirds of them actually will need it.  The gap between what older people think and expect and what really happens as we age is startling.  And it is likely to throw the burden of paying for it on the financially successful adult children of these elders in denial.  This particular group of business owners could absorb the cost. Many average people cannot.  Many people, women in particular have to eventually quit their jobs or give up their own retirement time to care for parents themselves.</p><p> What about the dollars and cents?  The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.genworth.com/corporate/about-genworth/industry-expertise/cost-of-care.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Genworth Cost of Care Survey  </a> </u>  is done every year and provides average rates charged by service providers for homemaker services, home health aides, adult day health, assisted living and nursing home care across the country.  And you can also search by state to see the average where your parents live.  Even the lowest level of care, someone to come in and help with cooking, shopping, laundry and errands averages $19 per hour, the national median hourly rate.  The national median monthly rate for assisted living is $3500.  And in my state, in urban areas and well populated centers, it is twice that.</p><p> If you have to consider paying for long term help for your aging loved ones, it&rsquo;s worth your time to do the math and figure out how much it may take. According to a colleague who knows long term care insurance benefits, the average time a person with this kind of insurance is collecting paymentsis three years or less.  If it&rsquo;s three years at $43,200 a year for assisted living, not factoring in the 2% annual increase in cost, that&rsquo;s $129,600. And that&rsquo;s under the unlikely scenario that a person who lives into her 90s, say, is going to stay level in what she needs over that three years.  More likely than not, her needs will increase and the facility will charge more every month for more services.  Here at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.agingparents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AgingParents.com  </a> </u> , we have had clients who are shelling out over $10,000 a month for a parent to be in assisted living.  When parent is infirm and needs a lot of things from the staff, every new thing increases the monthly cost.</p><h3> Near the end of our fruitful discussion, one of the participants asked &ldquo;What do the other 99% in our society do when an aging parent needs long term care?&rdquo;  </h3><p> <br/> The answer: they either provide the care themselves at a very high personal cost, or their parent spends what assets he has until they&rsquo;re gone.  Then he ends up on Medicaid in a shared little rom in a nursing home.   Longevity is great when they&rsquo;re healthy. When they&rsquo;re not, we need to be conscious of the cost of taking care of our loved ones.</p><p> If it so happens that you are the successful adult child of an aging parent with limited funds, here are four takeaway suggestions:</p><li> <strong>  Look ahead. </strong>  If your parents aren&rsquo;t wealthy and you are, guess who will be expected to help financially?</li><li> <strong>  If your parents or you can afford it, seriously consider long term care insurance. </strong>  If you wait too long to apply, the cost rises sharply and some diagnoses and conditions make an elder uninsurable. Dementia is one of those diagnoses.</li><li> <strong>  Educate yourself. </strong>  If you expect to pay out of pocket in the event that your loved one needs help at home or elsewhere, do the math and figure out how much cash you will probably need to set aside.  The longer our aging parents live, the more likely they will need help.</li><li> <strong>  Communicate with your aging parents about these issues. </strong>  Insist on the discussion.  You need to know what assets they have and where to find them.  They may not have planned on living so long and potentially outliving their money but you need to anticipate that possibility. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Smart planning now can save you shock and distress later. </strong>  Working with your aging parents to help them stretch their assets by conservative investing and spending will benefit both you and them in the long run.  And expect the long run. People in the 85+ age group are the fastest growing segment of our population.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-01 18:59:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-01 18:59:43.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_b7XlcRF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-will-it-cost-if-you-have-to-financially-support-your-aging-parents/\", \"post_id\": \"8971\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-01 18:59:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-01 18:59:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-will-it-cost-if-you-have-to-financially-support-your-aging-parents\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8970\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4267\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QA-With-Legacy-Planning-Expert-Laura-Roser.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"304\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454436000,"author_id":91,"chart_url":""}

As well as famous advocates from Winston Churchill to Pope Francis, Michael outlines why it helps &amp; how not to over do it:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-01-at-11.11.45-AM-2.png\" width=\"643\"/></p><h3> So, what about the promised personal disclosure?  </h3><p> <br/> What do I get up to in the bedroom? Well, as a young man I used to always be a sound sleeper. Like my sons now, I could sleep easily and normally got a full night&rsquo;s sleep. After 4 children&rsquo;s worth of disturbed nights &amp; the passage of years to middle age, I&rsquo;ve followed most men in becoming a lighter sleeper. Some studies show we can cope with less sleep as we get older, but I now wake easily if it&rsquo;s not dark, quiet &amp; cool (the best environment for sleep). So, partly out of necessity, I and my wife have learned to prioritize sleep more these days.  But I was always sceptical of my wife&rsquo;s habit to nap after lunch .</p><p> To me, napping in the day just felt indulgent, lazy and vaguely wrong. Rationally I was also concerned that I wouldn&rsquo;t sleep as well at night as a result. It was reading Michael Hyatt two years ago that encouraged me to give it a go. I&rsquo;m glad I did. During 25 years of office-life, I&rsquo;d become used to an energy &amp; alertness drop in the early afternoon. In the past this was simply addressed by another latte &amp; probably a cake (cue weight gain whilst in corporate life) and also became the prime time for emails/mindless activity. But since taking up napping, I can honestly say that it makes the afternoon feel like a second morning, another chance to start the day refreshed.</p><p> From personal experience, I would add one more tip to those mentioned by Arianna &amp; Michael, consistency. Once I determined to rise at the same hour every day &amp; wherever possible to nap for the same 45 minutes after lunch each day, those sleep times became more effective. Rising is easier and repeating this often enough to become a habit seems to make sleeping more effective and to feel like a natural biorhythm. I recommend you try it. Losing the lie-ins at the weekend can feel tough, but for an introvert like me, unhurried alone time in the morning is also calming &amp; refreshing.</p><p> Anyway, enough indulgent self-reflection, what about some science on all this? In Psychology Today,  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pauladavislaack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Paula Davis-Laack  </u> </a>  shares the results of a survey conducted by One Poll. Results from surveying 1,000 adults reveal that 91% sometimes or always wake up in the night. That accords with both my experience and a documentary on the BBC a few years ago which revealed that, before modern times it was regarded as normal, such that people would light candles &amp; read or work in this productive middle-of-the-night time. More seriously, 40% of survey respondents said they felt exhausted &amp; irritable as a result. 86% said they woke because of temperature &amp; this article shares some thoughts on overcoming the stress &amp; anxiety that can feed worsening sleep patterns, rather than be &ldquo;sleep macho&rdquo; instead:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-01-at-11.11.49-AM-2.png\" width=\"658\"/></p><h3> One final tip from me.</h3><p> <br/> For over a year now, I&rsquo;ve taken on the medical advice to avoid &lsquo;screen time&rsquo; prior to sleeping; to allow yourself an hour before you need to sleep to unwind. For me the most productive way to achieve this has been a return to my childhood pattern of reading in bed. Not business or technical books, that make me wake up further with new ideas firing off, but a return to reading fiction. Not only have a I now read more novels in a year than in any previous decade, but was able to enjoy &ldquo;Gone Girl&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;The Martian&rdquo; before seeing those films and am now recording the BBC&rsquo;s adaptation of &ldquo;War &amp; Peace&rdquo; as I finally complete reading Tolstoy&rsquo;s classic.</p><p> <strong>  How about you?

Inflation? Deflation? Valuations? Federal Reserve&rsquo;s actions?</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/advisor/researchcommentary/article/IWE_InvComGuardedBearish\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   As I&rsquo;ve said before, specific events matter far less than trends in economic and market conditions  </a> </u>  in determining market performance.</p><p> So if you&rsquo;re looking for a few points to share with clients, here&rsquo;s my cheat sheet on what really matters in today&rsquo;s markets and economy:</p><h3> 1. We&rsquo;re living in a low-growth world.</h3><p> <br/> Global GDP grew at a compounded annual rate of 3.8%, on average, from 1950 to 2014. I believe policymakers are likely to face difficulties achieving a 2% inflation rate in the medium term. As I said on Twitter in September, there&rsquo;s an upside:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"216\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1_9.png\" width=\"514\"/></p><h3> 2. China is the biggest contributor to slower global economic growth.</h3><p> <br/> The country remains an economic engine for the world but is winding down years of excess investment. Based on internal indicators, China could be experiencing annual GDP growth as low as 5.0%, despite its announced annual rate of 6.9% for the third quarter of 2015. In September I Tweeted:</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2_10.png\" width=\"511\"/> <p> Similar to investing in other emerging markets, investing in China involves idiosyncratic risks as the country continues integrating into the global financial system, but in the long run, an allocation to Chinese stocks can represent a meaningful portion of a globally diversified portfolio.</p><h3> 3. In China and elsewhere, many investors are focused on central banks&rsquo; monetary policy.</h3><p> <br/> This focus is well placed, but it draws attention away from a potentially more important issue: structural reform.</p><p> China, Europe, and Japan must continue implementing market-based reforms so investment capital can be allocated efficiently and support growth.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3_7.png\" width=\"511\"/></p><h3> 4. Due in part to the low-growth global environment, the Fed is likely to raise its target for short-term rates gradually, eventually increasing the rate to a level lower than the average rate we have seen historically.</h3><p> <br/> My Tweet below highlights another factor that may contribute to a relatively low rate at the end of this monetary tightening cycle:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/4_6.png\" width=\"516\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Although low interest rates could endure for a long period, I continue to believe a globally diversified portfolio incorporating an allocation to fixed income can provide ballast in clients&rsquo; portfolios during periods of market volatility.</p><h3> 5. The long-term nature of our low-growth world leaves me guarded, but not bearish, about investment returns.</h3><p> <br/> In an environment of ultralow interest rates, compressed risk premiums, and high equity valuations, clients will have to remain patient since their portfolios may experience lower returns. For the last 30 years, investors in a 60% stocks/40% bonds portfolio earned a return of 9.8% a year, on average. However, today our long-term-return forecast looks more like this:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5_5.png\" width=\"511\"/></p><p> The bottom line: Advisors can help clients reset long-term expectations. Clients should also consider ways to save and invest more to compensate for possibly reduced investment returns.</p><p> (And just in case you didn&rsquo;t get the hint, Twitter is a great way to find the latest thinking of Vanguard thought leaders on markets and the economy.

{"original_id":4113,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Employees Really Want in a Compensation Package","link":"what-employees-really-want-in-a-compensation-package","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Is your compensation package aligned with the goals of your firm to attract and retain a winning team?</h3><p> <br/> The impact to your bottom line due to employee loss is costly. Firms with mediocre compensation plans are likely to have high turnover rates and lose qualified job candidates.</p><p> Most business owners are in denial about what employees want and what it takes to retain them. A study by MetLife found employee loyalty has dropped steadily since 2008, but employers mistakenly believe it&rsquo;s on the rise. Incorporate fundamental components into your compensation package to enhance morale, performance, and employee retention.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s leading employees expect a comprehensive benefit package. Employees associate their value by how you compensate them. A quality compensation package benefits your firm with increased employee productivity and loyalty; enabling the team to focus on firm goals.</p><p> Take a look at what employees really want in a compensation package:</p><p> <strong>  Base Salary:  </strong>  Provide a base salary along with a range structure. Employees want and need something to strive toward. If they can&rsquo;t visualize &ldquo;moving-up&rdquo; and advancing in the firm, chances are they will find another place where they can excel. No one wants to be in a dead-end career.</p><p> <strong>  Bonuses: </strong>   Bonus dollars based on performance are a great incentive to increase productivity. Set goals that are measurable and attainable, yet stretch employees to develop and reach new heights. Performance based bonuses should not be a personal competition amongst team members. Utilize bonuses individually or as an entire group effort.</p><p> <strong>  PTO:  </strong> (Paid Time Off) Everyone needs time away. Employees who are not given sufficient time away from the office resort to lower productivity levels and burnout. Many firms are choosing to offer a Paid Time Off program or PTO. PTO is a flexible arrangement that gives employees a set amount of days off to be used at their discretion for vacation, sick leave, personal days, etc.</p><p> <strong>  Health and Wellness: </strong>  Providing a health and wellness package will aid your firm in attracting and retaining qualified and loyal employees. A total health and wellness package should include health insurance with dental and vision benefits, long and short-term disability, and life insurance. Some firms have added additional perks by offering wellness training or gym memberships. If you aren&rsquo;t interested in providing the whole enchilada, many employees will pay for a portion of their benefits rather than not have them at all.</p><p> <strong>  401(k) or Other Retirement Plans: </strong>   Employers are in the dark when it comes to determining what benefits are key drivers to employee loyalty. The study by MetLife revealed more than half (52%) of employees named retirement benefits as a vital payback. Financial insecurity has become more widespread, therefore, employees are looking for ways to plan and enhance their retirement years. Retirement plans give employees a compelling reason to remain loyal.</p><p> <strong>  Flexibility:  </strong>  Offer some flexibility and your employees may be willing to give up some of the other &ldquo;perks.&rdquo; Telecommuting popularity is on the rise. Working from home has never been easier with the growth of mobile technology. Employees, particularly those raising families, are in desperate need of flexibility. Place trust in your employee and provide flexibility. The tradeoff could benefit your bottom line with reduced costs of &ldquo;housing&rdquo; another employee along with increased productivity from your telecommuter.</p><h3> Your firm&rsquo;s compensation program will need continual reinforcement.</h3><p> <br/> Communication is vital between managers and employees to keep your compensation strategy alive. Schedule reviews frequently of your firm&rsquo;s compensation plan as well as regular communication with each team member. Talk openly and honestly. Encourage feedback and be willing to make changes.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-02 15:59:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-02 15:59:20.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_06G7izr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-employees-really-want-in-a-compensation-package/\", \"post_id\": \"8984\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-02 15:59:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-02 15:59:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-employees-really-want-in-a-compensation-package\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8983\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4270\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Employees-Really-Want-in-a-Compensation-Package.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"617\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454525100,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}

He goes to see Gordon Gekko, a renowned financier&ndash;played by Michael Douglas&mdash;to pitch him stock ideas. At every turn, Gekko rebuffs him, telling him his ideas are either old news or just plain bad. Rejecting his final idea, Gekko says, &ldquo;Not bad for a quant, but a dog with different fleas. Come on, tell me something I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s my birthday, pal, surprise me.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s bored.</p><p> At this point, desperate, Bud changes gears. He blurts out, \"Bluestar Airlines,\" adding, \"They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.\"</p><p> Suddenly, he&rsquo;s got Gekko&rsquo;s attention. <strong>  Gekko has gone, in an instant, from bored to&hellip;well, curious. </strong></p><h3> Your most powerful tool in client and business development is curiosity.</h3><p> <br/> Executives are assailed daily with service providers and suppliers who want to sell them something. Psychologically, these prospects are leaning back in their chairs with their arms crossed. Like Michael Douglas in the aforementioned scene with Charlie Sheen. Your job is to draw them into your conversation. To get them leaning forward in their chairs, thinking, <strong>  &ldquo;This is interesting. I want to know more.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Curiosity is the desire to know. There are many circumstances where it can be useful to evoke the other person&rsquo;s curiosity&mdash;to get them interested in learning more. These include sales, networking, and yes&mdash;romance.</p><h3> Here are six rules for evoking curiosity: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Tell people what they need to know, not everything you know. </strong> Give brief answers to questions. Hint at things. Don&rsquo;t lecture a prospect for ten minutes when they ask you to describe your firm.</p><p> <strong>  2. Be seen as someone at the crossroads of the marketplace </strong> &mdash;someone who always has interesting tidbits of information, points of view about what&rsquo;s going on in the world, insight into the competition, and so on.</p><p> <strong>  3. Develop contrarian or unusual perspectives. </strong> Be seen as someone who has refreshing points of view.</p><p> <strong>  4. Say the unexpected. </strong> For example, at the moment when people would expect you to brag about your accomplishments, tell them how lucky you&rsquo;ve been and how ignorance may have actually helped your career at a key turning point. Surprise them by attributing a good part of your success to those around you.</p><p> <strong>  5. Ask provocative questions. </strong> When everyone else is telling your client how to do something, you should be asking why they want to do it.</p><p> <strong>  6. Tell people what you do and the results you get, not every detail about how you do it. </strong> The former is interesting, the latter can become tedious.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-02 16:08:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-02 16:08:36.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_BrsmQqJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/six-rules-for-evoking-curiosity/\", \"post_id\": \"8986\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-02 16:08:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-02 16:08:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"six-rules-for-evoking-curiosity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8985\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4271\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Six-Rules-for-Evoking-Curiosity.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"508\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454495400,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

Are there any relationships I need to shift to make them work better?</p><p> What do I want to learn during the next year and what investments am I willing to make to continue to grow?</p><p> In the course of this appraisal, I also take a close look at my revenue streams&mdash;where is my income coming from and how am I poised to keep growing?</p><p> Two years ago, I made the decision to offer &ldquo;programs&rdquo;&mdash;including a handful of less-expensive coaching options than my usual deep brand consulting work. The idea was to give more affordable options to a wider range of potential clients. I envisioned attracting consultants and authors new(ish) to the field, helping them up to a bigger platform/more sales and ultimately building long-term relationships. A pipeline of sorts into my more in-depth offerings.</p><h3> Epic fail.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. </strong> I worked with a handful of people I am quite certain will be in my circle (to our mutual benefit) for years to come. We updated their websites. I encouraged them to reach for something they desperately wanted but were afraid to grasp. They are each soaring in their unique way.</p><p> But those were the exceptions. I met plenty of people who just didn&rsquo;t take their work seriously enough to buckle down and do the work. Who were looking for a quick fix and afraid to spend the time and/or money to do the deep work branding, marketing and selling yourself and your work requires.</p><p> And as I looked at the time it took me to serve those clients (my most popular option came with unlimited emails), I was selling myself cheap. And worse: the brilliant success stories of my higher-end programs and consulting&mdash;my stock-in-trade&mdash;were not happening consistently.</p><p> It was time for a change. The same one I often advise my clients to take. Focus on your sweet-spot. Where you make the biggest impact in your clients&rsquo; lives and are doing the work that makes you literally sing.</p><h3> Those low-end options were making me grumpy. So I&rsquo;m kissing them good-bye.</h3><p> <br/> Which of course frees up more time to focus on my true tribe&mdash;the people I can impact deeply and sustainably. Because the reason I started this business (vs staying in a big-firm leadership role) is that I wanted to do the hands-on work. Not for huge, soul-less corporations, but for real people running real businesses facing real challenges.</p><p> <strong>  That&rsquo;s what gets my motor revving. </strong></p><p> Let me be your cautionary tale. Take a look&mdash;a good HARD look&mdash;at the work you&rsquo;re preaching and what it brings to your actual and psychic bottom line. Is it feeding both? Is it sustainable?</p><p> Do the math and then trust your gut.

In 2015 we saw the emergence of a number of new trends.</p><h3> The HR landscape is changing more rapidly than ever before.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Trends, such as recruitment through social media, the impact of Generation Z, and the overhaul of performance reviews, were all apparent in 2015. </strong> In 2016, it&rsquo;s likely that traditional business practices will be further disrupted by technology. According to the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bersin.com/uploadedFiles/disruptions-for-2016.pdf?aliId=66864491\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bersin report  </a> </u> , it&rsquo;s likely the entire human resources platform will be accessible from one mobile application. Companies will look to create further employee engagement - employees who are fully absorbed by and enthusiastic about their work - and undertake further culture management. Tech companies will likely be looking to take advantage of the new generation of HR leaders, all of which have been accustomed to the use of mobile technology in their personal lives already. So What were some of the other developments that occurred in 2015 and how likely are they to affect 2016. What changes will the industry see in 2016? And how do they affect your workplace?</p><p> According to Dan Schawbel&rsquo;s <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2014/10/29/the-top-10-workplace-trends-for-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">   10 workplace trends for 2015  </a> </u> , the workplace should have seen an array  of companies using social media to attract and retain top talent. According to the <u>  <a href=\"http://booleanblackbelt.com/2015/01/insights-from-linkedins-2015-global-recruiting-trends/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   global recruiting trends report  </a> </u> , one of the most effective ways to attract talent in 2015 was still through company career websites and internet job boards. Many believed the job board would die with the advent of social media, however 74% of the 4000 interviewed companies said that the internet job board still remained the most effective source of attracting top talent. However, the report went on to say that the fastest growing platform for hires remains for quality social professional networks, such as Linkedin.</p><p> <strong>  2015 saw the introduction of Gen Z into the workforce through internships and traineeships. </strong> This post independent, pragmatic and always in a rush generation is <u>  <a href=\"http://growingleaders.com/blog/generation-z-a-look-at-the-future/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   determined to succeed  </a> </u> . According to Laurence Benhamou, a journalist who penned the article <u>  <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/afp-generation-z-born-in-the-digital-age-2015-2?r=US&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Everything you need to know about Generation Z  </a> </u> &ldquo;this generation's primary driver is to own and run their own business&rdquo;. He went on to say that &ldquo;76% of this generation are aiming to make a hobby out of their job and they believe that their success comes from their &lsquo;network&rsquo; instead of their qualifications&rdquo;. So how did they perform in the workplace in 2015?</p><p> A <u>  <a href=\"http://pages.adeccousa.com/rs/107-IXF-539/images/generation-z-vs-millennials.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent report  </a> </u> compiled by Adecco outlined what Gen Z expects in the workplace. Their top priority is obtaining their dream job within 10 years time, so companies have to focus on talent development and career growth. Out of the 1000 students surveyed, 36% cited that opportunity for growth is their number one priority when looking for employment. While a further 19% wanted their roles to be somehow associated to their personal interests.</p><p> <strong>  The annual performance review was bound to get a revamp in 2015. </strong> According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/07/21/in-big-move-accenture-will-get-rid-of-annual-performance-reviews-and-rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  data </a> obtained from the management research firm CEB, 6% of Fortune 500 companies have stopped using annual performance reviews and forced rankings. This year we saw <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/deloitte-joins-adobe-and-accenture-in-dumping-performance-reviews-360-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Deloitte </a> and <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/accenture-dumped-performance-reviews-here-is-why-360-feedback\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Accenture  </a> </u> dumping and redesigning performance reviews, in favour of more continuous and ongoing feedback. Considering performance reviews had never been through any &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;, the process was in need of a complete overhaul. According to a public survey conducted by Deloitte, 58% of their managers stated that traditional performance reviews do not serve its purpose. Deloitte has since moved over to a design which recognises, understands and fuels performance. Tech companies, such as <u>  <a href=\"http://www.impraise.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Impraise  </a> </u> , are rethinking the way in which companies are conducting performance reviews, focusing on ongoing and real-time feedback.</p><h3> 2016: A Look to the year ahead</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  What are the biggest trends we can see going forward? </strong> What is likely to disrupt the way in which companies view the workplace and how does HR fit into this ever changing work environment? In this new world of work, we are seeing the line between work life and personal life becoming obsolete, employees are now hyperconnected to their roles, and technology is likely to have  an even greater impact on business in 2016. Information is accessible with a simple tap of a screen or wearable device, providing key data insights into companies and ambitious startups alike.</p><h3> The workplace and mobile applications</h3><p> <br/> According to the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   KPCB report  </a> </u> , there are now more than 2.1 billion smartphone users on the planet. Mobile internet growth increased by 69% in 2014 and will continue to grow at a rapid pace. <strong>  For the study, 1019 millennials were interviewed and found that 78% of interviewee&rsquo;s smartphones never left their side </strong> , being the first thing they look at when they wake and the last thing they look at when they go to sleep. A further 60% believed that by 2020, every daily activity will be done through a smartphone. In 2016 there is a good chance that this mobile technology will spill over into the HR space. Companies will need to &ldquo;appify&rdquo; their HR tools, in order to engage and understand employees in a more quantifiable manner. According to the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bersin.com/uploadedFiles/disruptions-for-2016.pdf?aliId=66864491\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bersin report  </a> </u> in 2016, it&rsquo;s likely that we will see a breakthrough in engagement and feedback systems, as well as apps for learning, employee feedback and performance check-ins. It is also likely that there will be more applications for time and attendance management, expense reimbursement; employee directories and collaboration, as well as, applications for video interviewing, recruitment and candidate marketing.</p><h3> The return of the employee</h3><p> <br/> In an era where job-hopping amongst young professionals has become the norm, millennial employees will likely be seen again in the future. According to the <u>  <a href=\"https://workplacetrends.com/the-corporate-culture-and-boomerang-employee-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   workplace trends report  </a> </u> , 76% of the organisations interviewed prefered rehiring ex employees, as these employees require less training, as they were aware of the business practices already and generally a better culture fit. The report went on to say that in the past 5 years, 85% of the companies interviewed, received job applications from previous employees. What's more, 40% of these companies said that they hired those employees. Several factors are contributing to this new phenomenon. Social media sites are making it easier for company leaders and managers to keep in contact with previous employees. With <u>  <a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?id=rAjoyoTv6qcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=With+digital+profiles+of+ex+employees+being+stored+more+regularly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oHvCeB04i1&amp;sig=cOSYpm2tGSfo4v_Lje0kuuwhzN8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimpKKN8cnJAhXFgQ8KHShcBoQQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=With%20digital%20profiles%20of%20ex%20employees%20being%20stored%20more%20regularly&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">   digital profiles  </a> </u> of ex employees being stored more regularly, companies are now able to get historical information of previous employees more quickly and timely. There are a number of benefits to hiring a boomerang employee. When employees leave the company, they gain valuable skills and expand their professional networks. When they eventually return, they come with a wealth of experience and extensive networks from which a company can benefit from. What&rsquo;s more is that these employees boost office morale, streamline reentry into the workplace culture, and require less information when onboarding, making it more agile and faster to bring ex employees up to speed.</p><h3> The millennial manager</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Generation Y is currently the largest generation in the workplace, so it&rsquo;s inevitable that business will see them as leaders in the near future. </strong> As this generation continues to mature, they will move into leadership roles in ways that are much different than generations before them. Often these millennials do not have prerequisites of certain job titles or even experience. In a study compiled by <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2843113/careers-staffing/how-to-help-millennials-prepare-to-be-successful-leaders.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Virtuali  </a> </u> , 71% of millennials already consider themselves to be leaders in their personal capacity  (even though less than half interviewed had held any formal leadership positions). The majority of these millennials consider themselves &ldquo;situational leaders&rdquo; - leaders in project teams, volunteering their experiences and influencing people. The report goes on to say that 64% of respondents  do not feel they are fully prepared to be leaders yet, mostly because they lack the ability to manage and develop other employees. According to the report compiled by workplace trends, nearly 50% of millennials surveyed defined leadership as empowering others to succeed. A more compassionate leadership style will be the trademark of the millennial manager. Millennials like to collaborate with their peers in order to achieve objectives and are transformational leaders. Using strong teaming skills, millennial leaders consider creating leadership teams in order to share the demanding workload.</p><h3> Wearing productivity</h3><p> <br/> In 2015 there was a growing trend toward wearable technology, such as smart bands and smartwatches, in the workplace. These devices have the ability to track, monitor and store data about an employee's efficiencies and wellness in the workplace. In 2015, British Petroleum <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-21/wear-this-device-so-the-boss-knows-you-re-losing-weight\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   distributed  </a> </u> 24500 fitbits to track employees health and wellness. <strong>  According to the  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-07/wearable-technology-creeps-into-the-workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    wearable technology   </a>  </u>  report, around 2000 companies worldwide will offer their employees fitness trackers in 2016. </strong> What's more, more than 60% of millennials in the report said that they would be willing to wear smart devices, provided that they increased efficiencies and productivity. Smart devices are likely to increase efficiencies incrementally as tasks, such as checking email and checking in at the office, will become streamlined to the wrist. From 2015, workplace software <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-08-01/wearable-technology-will-let-companies-monitor-worker-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kronos  </a> </u> , says it's expanding its platform to smart devices to offer tracking and communication capabilities. This new technology is likely to take advantage of the 24/7 business environment, quickly retrieving information and notifying employees quicker than any other smart mobile device.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Be prepared for the eventuality of mobile applications in the workplace </strong> &ndash;  with mobile applications being on the upward trend and millennials entering leadership roles, it means that there will be an increasing likelihood that business functions will all be mobile in 2016. These mobile applications will increase are likely to increase productivity and take advantage of the 24/7 workplace.</li><li> <strong>  Be open to returning employees </strong> - it's likely there will be more and more &lsquo;boomerang&rsquo; employees.

{"original_id":4117,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Things NOT to Do in a Down Market","link":"5-things-not-to-do-in-a-down-market","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There&rsquo;s no denying it: last week was a doozy.</h3><p> <br/> Last Wednesday, the Dow took its deepest dive of the year to date, dropping more than 3% mid-day, then bouncing back to close down &ldquo;only&rdquo; 1.4% at 15,767. For those of us who have gotten used to seeing Dow numbers in the high 17,000s, we got flashbacks to 2008 when the market went into a freefall. This has been the worst start of a new year ever.</p><p> The good news is that we are, in no way whatsoever, in the same climate as in 2008. As I&rsquo;ve said before, while there are numerous factors impacting the market at the moment, the problem is not the US economy. And while that may not make the numbers feel any better, it does mean that we&rsquo;re most likely facing a short-term down market&mdash;the industry refers to it as a &ldquo;correction&rdquo; if it&rsquo;s around 10% or so. But as long as the US economy continues on its upward trend, most forecasts point to a full recovery. The question, of course, is &ldquo;when?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  The answer is simple: No one knows. </strong> With that in mind, it&rsquo;s important to remember that making a wrong move at the wrong time can do much more harm to your portfolio than any market downswing. Here are 5 things not to do to be sure you maximize the situation while keeping your risk as low as possible:</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t doubt your portfolio. </h3><p> <br/> Assuming you&rsquo;re working with a knowledgeable financial advisor, your portfolio should already be balanced to absorb a certain level of risk depending on your time horizon. Most of my clients are either nearing or already in retirement, so our portfolios include an average of 40-42% stocks. This means that around 60% of each portfolio is already positioned to downplay market risk. And if you do second-guess your strategy, where would you go? All the alternatives present challenges of their own. Gold is a losing proposition (read my July blog  <u>  Forget the \"proven\" path to success and stick to the basics </u>  to learn more). Hedge funds and commodities aren&rsquo;t any safer than stocks. And stuffing cash under your mattress stops future earnings in their tracks. Trust the decisions you made when the market was rising&mdash;they&rsquo;re just as good today as they were last July.</p><h3> 2. Don&rsquo;t think short term. </h3><p> <br/> Unless you&rsquo;re a day trader (which I do not recommend!), your focus should be on the long term. And when looking at the long-term outlook for the US economy, things are pretty darned bright. Last week, some investors panicked and shifted stocks into less volatile government bonds. There are two big issues with that strategy. First, &ldquo;shifting&rdquo; means selling, and by selling when the market was down, money was lost. Second, while that money is now in a &ldquo;safer&rdquo; place, there&rsquo;s no chance to recover the loss. Shifting to bonds is a purely emotional move that doesn&rsquo;t account for the fact that, inevitably, the market will rise again.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on China. </h3><p> <br/> Yes, China has been dampening the US stock market. The lack of transparency by China&rsquo;s government has scared investors who aren&rsquo;t sure what to believe. As transparency increases (the shift has already begun), investors will feel more confident in the numbers, and the market should react positively. Adding to the fear factor are the misleading headlines about China. Sure, China&rsquo;s economy is (as the media loves to shout) &ldquo;the lowest it&rsquo;s been in 25 years.&rdquo; But when you consider that China was leading the entire world in growth for three decades, that claim is much less exciting. China&rsquo;s economy has slowed because it&rsquo;s in the midst of an economic transition, moving from a pure manufacturing model to a service model. In this scenario, earnings for established manufacturers slow, and it can take some time for the newer service-based businesses to flourish.</p><h3> 4. Don&rsquo;t stop investing. </h3><p> <br/> If you still have two or more years to go before retirement, now is the time to invest as much as you can into the market. Wall Street is having a fantastic sale! The S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s forward PE ratio stands at 14.9, its lowest since the first quarter of 2013 and well off the 17.4 level of last May when the stock market hit its record high. The recent year-over-year profit declines for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to take until at least the second quarter of 2016 to improve. If that happens, then we&rsquo;d have the rest of this first quarter to reposition assets to advantage.</p><h3> 5. Don&rsquo;t forget to utilize other assets. </h3><p> <br/> If you are retired and you&rsquo;re already taking distributions from your portfolio, explore using other assets to cover your expenses. You&rsquo;ll still have to take your required minimum distribution (RMD), but if you&rsquo;re taking more than the minimum, see if you can cut back by leaning on non-stock assets such as savings accounts and CDs. The more you can keep in the market at the moment, the more opportunity you&rsquo;ll have to recover from the downturn. Now may also be a good time to rethink large expenditures. My client Joe had two costly vacations planned in the next 12 months&mdash;a 2-week winter cruise that was going to cost $10,000, and a long-planned anniversary trip to Europe with his wife in August that will cost $15,000. Because Joe wants to cut back on his IRA withdrawals, he&rsquo;s decided to forego the cruise. And maybe by August the market may be in recovery mode and he and his wife can head to Paris without a worry. C&rsquo;est la vie.</p><p> We all know someone who made a bad choice in the past&mdash;either in 2008 or earlier&mdash;by reacting to the market numbers and acting out of fear, rather than looking at the situation from all angles and creating an appropriate, long-term strategy. One good friend of mine pulled all his money out of stocks until it was the &ldquo;right time&rdquo; to get back in. He&rsquo;s still waiting.

{"original_id":4118,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Monitoring Goals Matters Most","link":"why-monitoring-goals-matters-most","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So many of us get charged up and rattle off an impressive list of goals but then struggle to follow through.</p><h3> The disconnect between creating and accomplishing is where life change gets stuck. Months pass and we realize our lives are no different.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Where did progress stop (or never begin)? </strong></p><p> Often, it&rsquo;s when life&rsquo;s curveballs throw us off our game.  Even though we know the surprises will come, we&rsquo;re not prepared when they show up.</p><p> I thought about this recently on a Saturday morning, when my mind drifted to how enjoyable it would be to extend our screened porch. Wait, did this just become a goal?  What about the 10 year anniversary trip we want to take next year? We also know one of our cars will need replacing in a few years.  If we do all three of those things, will we be able to hit our charitable and retirement savings targets as well?</p><p> That&rsquo;s just it. Financial goal planning is a fluid process.  You have to place a value on how important that thing on your mind right now is to the list of other priorities you&rsquo;ve thought about on other Saturday mornings.</p><p> Without prioritization of goals, we allow our impulses to rule our decision-making.  This thought process ignores your plan, pushing the things that aren&rsquo;t as much &ldquo;fun&rdquo; to the bottom of your list.</p><p> Having an effective monitoring process increases your odds that follow through will happen.</p><h3> Recording Your Goals</h3><p> <br/> Many of us don&rsquo;t keep a running list of things we want to accomplish.  This is why when asked about our goals, we freeze and find it hard to get specific other than &ldquo;to assure we are maximizing our investment returns.&rdquo;</p><p> Knowing why you want to get the best investment return helps keep the focus in the right direction.  It also helps identify quantifiable steps that will help you get there.</p><p> Goal setting begins with recording.  So often, I will be talking with someone that triggers an idea I want to pursue. If I don&rsquo;t get it down quickly, the idea is forgotten.</p><p> One of the most practical digital tools for this is Evernote.  This helps create a central location of all the ideas that are up next on the to do list.  From small goals to large goals.</p><p> Having a list, helps compare the newest goal to all the other goals you have in the queue.  For example, is the next home project more important than maxing your 401k this year? Depends on the person and what your long-term plan is. If retiring early is important to you, then 401k savings matters more now than a kitchen remodel.</p><p> We also know our desires can change quickly, which is why prioritizing regularly is vital.</p><p> This is why we encourage setting a few different lists.</p><p> <strong>  Immediate &ndash; now to 3 months </strong></p><p> <strong>  Short-Term &ndash; within 2 years </strong></p><p> <strong>  Longer-Term &ndash; 3+ years </strong></p><p> Some people like to add a lifetime category which helps shape more vision type of actions.  Are you doing the small (and sometimes mundane) things today that get you closer to the lifetime goals?</p><p> Assigning time-frames and dollar amounts helps you measure success.</p><p> Once you create the ideas of where you want to go, we discuss the best way to implement goals. Even though we all are incentivized differently, a process keeps us moving forward.</p><h3> Monitoring</h3><p> <br/> Some things are easy to implement and can be done very quickly (setting up Roth IRA contributions for example). But not every goal can be tackled quickly.</p><p> If your main goal is lowering spending, then it&rsquo;s more of a gradual process that takes tracking and regular review. While a future large purchase requires diligence in hitting saving targets.</p><p> Consequently, we set up our systems so the top goals for each client are displayed each time we interact with them.</p><p> Some examples include next car purchases, home projects, inheritances, or retiring early.</p><p> But setting the goals is not enough. It requires consistent accountability partners. This is why we have automated follow ups along with scheduled phone calls to follow up. Checking in after 2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months and a year keeps the focus front and center.</p><h3> Adjustments </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Goals that are not measurable tend to fizzle out. </strong></p><p> So after recording and monitoring, if a goal was too vague, it&rsquo;s time for an adjustment.</p><p> Personally, I like to revisit my goals every 90 days, which allows for any adjustments as changes arise.  At a minimum, reviewing your objectives at least annually will allow you to refocus any goals that are growing stale.</p><h3> How Did You Do?</h3><p> <br/> The end of a year presents a great opportunity to look back and see where you stand. Seeing progress motivates you to continue progress.</p><p> <strong>  Personally, this process starts during the year. </strong>  I keep a document in Evernote, that is called &ldquo;Key Accomplishments.&rdquo;  During my quarterly review, I take a moment to record all the things I can think of that were steps forward.</p><p> This list includes it all (small and big accomplishments).  From wakeboarding for the first time to reading a book I&rsquo;ve wanted to read.  You&rsquo;ll be surprised how fulfilling it is to look back after a year and see all you&rsquo;ve done.</p><p> For next year, I plan to set a few stretch goals (from  <u>  Steve Sanduski&rsquo;s podcast &ldquo;Between Now and Success </u> &rdquo;).  Goals that I know I won&rsquo;t meet but will motivate me to try.  I&rsquo;m betting I will be surprised by the progress.</p><p> <strong>  So what goals will you focus on this year? </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-02 17:39:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-02 17:39:28.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_z23to7q.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-monitoring-goals-matters-most/\", \"post_id\": \"8995\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-02 17:39:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-02 17:39:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-monitoring-goals-matters-most\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8996\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4276\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Monitoring-Goals-Matters-Most.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"596\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454522400,"author_id":100,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4119,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Challenging the Competition Using Change","link":"challenging-the-competition-using-change","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Change is Happening, Even When You Think it isn&rsquo;t</h3><p> <br/> Japan is way ahead of us with regards to the robotics revolution at work. Driven by labor shortages, the Japanese government has launched a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/robotics-revolution-picks-up-steam-in-japan-workplaces\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   five-year push  </a> </u>  to help the use of intelligent machines in manufacturing, supply chains, construction, and health care. The plan is to expand the robotics market from 660 billion yen (S$7.7 billion) to 2.4 trillion yen by 2020.</p><h3> Japan isn&rsquo;t alone. Things are changing in the Western world as well.</h3><p> <br/> Maybe you haven&rsquo;t noticed it very much? Before you know it, the daily operations get all your attention. Good for revenue now, but it won&rsquo;t produce a sustainable competitive advantage in the future. For two main reasons:</p><li> <strong>  Even the most loyal customers defect in the end: they move, get better offers or don&rsquo;t need your product or service anymore </strong></li><li> <strong>  The business environment changes: what used to be a perfect fit, may not be so in the future </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Even though robots may be expensive to buy now, their price has decreased immensely and will fall further. A 2015 report by BCG states ten years from now,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/industrial-robots-could-be-16-less-costly-employ-people-2025-1811980\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   robots will be cheaper than the cost of labor  </a> </u> . Some say 16% cheaper. Can you imagine what that would do to price pressure?</p><p> Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just the industrial robot arm. Robots are much more than arms that assemble, paint or package. They can also be outfitted as external skeletons, increasing the endurance and strength of the people who wear them. Or it can just tell you what to do, helping you to prevent mistakes and to organize your work.</p><p> With robots, we can deliver faster, make fewer errors, and add much more personalization to the offer we make our customers. There&rsquo;s hardly a business that won&rsquo;t be affected. The businesses not joining the price and flawless delivery spiral will have to invest in other selling points. Their added value has to justify a growing disparity in price. What used to be a dollar difference may now become a 16 dollar difference. Is your offering good enough to explain that gap away?</p><h3> Pressure on Your Competitive Position</h3><p> <br/> And market pressure doesn&rsquo;t come from robotization alone. Advanced materials will outperform normal materials and be cheaper and more sustainable to produce. Haptics, virtual reality, and augmented reality will reduce the needs for devices as phones, tablets, laptops and other screens. We&rsquo;re truly at the eve of the technological revolution.</p><p> Do you think it will pass you by? I doubt it. Even the most traditional businesses, in conservative markets, will have to cater to customers influenced by technological advancements in health care, leisure, sports and entertainment. Customers&rsquo; lives aren&rsquo;t compartmentalized. If we experience major benefits in one sector of our lives, we won&rsquo;t want to make do in other sectors.</p><p> It&rsquo;s like this: we all use satellites for navigation and for the weather forecasts. So much so, that when an airplane disappears off the radar, we can&rsquo;t imagine that the plane can actually get lost. We no longer accept a disappearance and start suspecting foul play when it can&rsquo;t be found immediately.</p><p> As your stolen car or lost smartphone, things become more and more traceable. Take this a step further with the Internet of Things: when all our stuff is hooked up to the Internet, it can&rsquo;t get lost any longer. We&rsquo;ll no longer accept misplacement, stock shortages, or faulty parts as a reason for postponed delivery or service. Just-in-time delivery will get a whole new meaning, even when you&rsquo;re not a tech company.</p><h3> Change Measuring Benefits</h3><p> <br/> Yes, the rate of change can be measured. Stock price fluctuations, market share shifts, variations in costs of raw materials, we measure change all the time. That is to say, we track changes that already have happened and extrapolate from there to the future. It&rsquo;s the same for insurance premiums, the degree of competition, or performance.</p><p> One layer deeper, we measure the change rate of the changes in our market, also called &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve written another post on how that&rsquo;s done, please find it  <u>  here </u> .</p><p> The benefit of uncertainty calculations is to ground your gut feeling in actual data. We have to do that occasionally because our cognition does play tricks on us. Take this for an example: I recently bought a second-hand Land Rover. I thought it was quite a rare car in these parts of the country. But since I have one myself, I see Land Rovers all over the place. Sigh.</p><p> This phenomenon even has a name: frequency bias.</p><p> Passively noticing more of what you&rsquo;re focused on isn&rsquo;t just true for spontaneous events as cars passing by. It also occurs when we&rsquo;re on a fact-finding mission. When we&rsquo;re actively searching for information, we tend to look for facts that support our ideas. We&rsquo;re all prone to confirmation bias, and it happens even when we&rsquo;re aware of it.</p><p> Hence, checking your gut feeling with actual data on change won&rsquo;t hurt. But there&rsquo;s more we can do than just measuring change.</p><h3> Treat Change as a Given</h3><p> <br/> Treating change as a given may be a discriminating factor between the average and the successful company. Captains of Industry in-variously tell me:</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s not uncertainty in and of itself, but the unpredictability of it&rsquo;s effects that we need to manage </strong></p><p> Instead of focusing on change rates, they direct their attention at innovation and unique improvements as a strategy to stay ahead. Notice the word unique. It&rsquo;s no use investing time and energy in something that the competition can do better. Get future forward today and use change to get your business into the new era.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-02 18:05:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-02 18:05:43.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_zjOQSnJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/challenging-the-competition-using-change/\", \"post_id\": \"8998\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-02 18:05:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-02 18:05:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"challenging-the-competition-using-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"8997\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4277\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Challenging-the-Competition-Using-Change.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"679\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454530500,"author_id":52,"chart_url":""}

Since I&rsquo;m on the road a lot, I get to see quite a few of these lists, and I am always impressed by the care and thought that obviously went into them.</p><p> One thing I&rsquo;ve learned along the way, however, is this: &ldquo;Having&rdquo; a set of Core Values on the wall means next to nothing; <strong>  it&rsquo;s living them that leads to great brands and enduring companies. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Think of it this way: </strong> For the great companies, a Core Value is not a &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;way.&rdquo; Everyone knows, for example, that legendary customer service is a Core Value at the Nordstrom Company. For Nordstrom employees, service is not just a chart, or a standard, or a specification&mdash;it&rsquo;s a way of doing, being and working. It&rsquo;s a state of mind, a commitment, an expression of pride, a spirit. And you don&rsquo;t just read about it on some plaque on the wall when you walk in their door, you actually feel it, appreciate it and remember it.</p><p> This, of course, is one of the reasons so many people come back to companies like Nordstrom again and again. It&rsquo;s not just their convenient locations or their quality clothing that attracts people, <strong>  it&rsquo;s also their values in action. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Remember: your Core Values are choices you and your company make about how you will treat your customers and your co-workers on the road to achieving your company Mission and your Vision. In good times or bad, your unique set of Values should unify and strengthen your team. They should distinguish the ethics, style, purpose and meaning of your work from your competitors. They should also define your unique culture and brand, and guide your every decision and action. </strong></p><p> So, if your company or work unit has a plaque on the wall with your Core Values on it, be sure to remind yourselves now and then that those Values are what you stand for.

The better known, more intelligent, better looking, or more respected an expert forecaster is, the greater the confidence we have in their predictions.&rdquo;As I have written about before, even Federal Reserve Governors and their economists are poor soothsayers (see the bottom of this article for related posts and research).Below is a quote from a report published in February of 2015 by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on a study of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee&rsquo;s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP):&ldquo;Over the past seven years, many growth forecasts, including the SEP&rsquo;s&hellip;, have been too optimistic. In particular, the SEP forecast (1) did not anticipate the Great Recession that started in December 2007, (2) underestimated the severity of the downturn once it began, and (3) consistently over-predicted the speed of the recovery that started in June 2009.&rdquo;Some might say, &ldquo;well, this not unexpected, the best minds are not in the public sector but in the private sector inside the best investment banks.&rdquo;My halo bias wants to believe this, but independent analysis of investment analysts&rsquo; estimates and projections paints a consistent picture.<h3> They are also often wrong at the wrong time.</h3>As an example, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> McKinsey &amp; Company</a> produced a study in 2001 about the accuracy of earnings estimates, which was then updated in 2010.  The following quote summarizes their findings:&ldquo;Analysts, we found, were typically overoptimistic, slow to revise their forecasts to reflect new economic conditions, and prone to making increasingly inaccurate forecasts when economic growth declined.  On average, analysts&rsquo; forecasts have been almost 100 percent too high.&rdquo;The chart below is from the most recent 2010 McKinsey &amp; Co. research paper. The light green line represents Wall Street earnings forecasts. The blue line reflects what actually happened.Like Bill Murray could not believe during his groundhog day experience, surely we learned something during the last financial crisis and are not repeating things over and over the same way.Well, just as recent experience has shown that political predictions are difficult, research on the accuracy of investment estimates continues to disappoint.CXO Advisory recently published a report based on over 6,500 predictions made by 68 investment gurus covering the time period 1998 &ndash; 2012.<h3> What did they find?</h3>The accuracy of well-known investment strategy professionals, to include <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Grantham\" target=\"_blank\">  Jeremy Grantham </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Joseph_Cohen\" target=\"_blank\">  Abby Joseph Cohen </a></u>, was only 47%, or worse than a coin toss (see the following for the complete study &ndash; <u> <a href=\"http://www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Guru Grades </a></u>).Evidence suggests that market predictions aren&rsquo;t worth much, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean you should go into an investment hole during difficult, wintry market conditions.If you have spent time developing a long-term plan that is based on your goals, and not the models of others, stay on course, or as we wrote about before, just <u> <a href=\"/advisor/keep-a-steady-hand-on-the-tiller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Keep A Steady Hand On The Tiller </a></u>.So, if you see rough market shadows that make you feel like a groundhog, remember, history shows that market troubles eventually thaw, and that steady long-term investors are consistently rewarded.And hey, if you want confirmation that I am correct, just read the stories out today about Punxsutawney Phil. He did not see his shadow, so the good times of Spring are definitely just a few weeks away.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-02 18:55:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-02 18:55:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Q1QNWQ3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/wall-street-and-groundhog-day/\", \"post_id\": \"9004\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-02 18:55:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-02 18:55:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"wall-street-and-groundhog-day\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9003\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4280\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ground-Hog-Day.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"950\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1517588100,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

However, despite the popularity of using social media as a customer service cudgel, most customers still say that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingcharts.com/traditional/phone-calls-still-consumers-preferred-method-of-contacting-businesses-39456/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the phone is their preferred method  </a> </u>  of contacting customer service. That means that your phone customer service reps need to be sharp, courteous and effective &ndash; traits that are difficult to come by as American workers  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/#2715e4857a0b2a7f687a5576\" target=\"_blank\">   spend less time on the phone  </a> </u>  themselves. My family has been in the 24/7  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hastingshumans.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   phone customer service business  </a> </u>  since 1948 and in the ensuing 68 years, we&rsquo;ve picked up quite a few tricks to make telephone customer service as smooth as possible. I won&rsquo;t share all of our secrets, but here are five tips you can use to help your customer service reps sound like pros on the phone.</p><h3> Exercise Call Control</h3>If you work with telephone systems, you may be familiar with call control as a process relating to how calls are routed. On the customer service side, call control refers to how your rep sets the tone of each interaction. At the beginning of the call, find out what the customer&rsquo;s needs are and set out a clear path for how to meet those needs. Try to ask open-ended questions. Take everything one step at a time and don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get flustered or distracted. You can&rsquo;t control the attitude of the person on the other end of the line, so the best way to make them happy is to get them the information they need as quickly as possible!<h3> Scripts Are For Actors</h3>Phone scripts may be tempting as a quality control mechanism, but they don&rsquo;t exactly make your customer feel valued and important. The advantage to talking to a human being on the phone, as opposed to a robot, is that another person has autonomy and can actually solve problems &ndash; rather than just passing them on. According to a recent study, <u> <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/cust-exp-impact-report-epss-1560493.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  57% of customers </a></u> feel that customer service reps are clueless. Train your customer service reps to diagnose and solve problems and you&rsquo;ll make your customers happy and free up management from having to constantly tag in on phone calls.<h3> Use Old Fashioned Manners</h3>One of the oldest charm tricks in the book is asking for and using someone&rsquo;s name. Even if your rep already has the customer name on a computer in front of them, asking the caller their name reminds them that there&rsquo;s another person on the line and sets the stage for a more human interaction. Please, thank you, yes sir and yes ma&rsquo;am go a long way, as well.<h3> Be Smooth</h3>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; &ldquo;uh&rdquo; and &ldquo;you know&rdquo; don&rsquo;t instill much confidence in consumers. These filler words can make your customer service reps seem unprofessional and they make calls take longer. Normally, you don&rsquo;t think about using these common vocal tics, which is why one of the best ways to get rid of them is simply by being aware. During training, have your reps take a mock call and then listen back to it, counting all the times they use filler words. Simple awareness goes a long way toward resolving the issue. From there, train your reps to speak complete thoughts and then rest and compose their next thought. Brief pauses are less noticeable than filler words and the pauses give your customer opportunities to give you more information.<h3> Invest In Your Reps</h3>Customer service reps get a bad rap, but it&rsquo;s usually because they don&rsquo;t get a lot of support. Typically, customer service reps get some basic training and are thrown into the fire. This doesn&rsquo;t make much sense &ndash; especially when a customer service experience could be the difference between a sale and the customer telling all of their friends to never do business with you again. If your phone customer service is going to be your business&rsquo; primary point of contact for the majority of your customers, you want it to be a sales tool. Take the time to give your customer service reps a level of training that will allow them to resolve customer issues.

{"original_id":4123,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Clients Should Use Their Phone to Sign More Documents","link":"clients-should-use-their-phone-to-sign-more-documents","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I bought my house while shopping in a Gordman&rsquo;s on December 14, 2015. It&rsquo;s true. I was walking down an aisle with my husband looking at a resin cardinal statue and my realtor sent me to a DocuSign link which I clicked, signed the screen of my iPhone, pressed &lsquo;sign here&rsquo; and then put the cardinal in my shopping cart. I remember it vividly because the next aisle I stopped and said to my husband,  <strong>  &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t life insurance purchases always be this simple?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> So I started doing my homework. Sure enough,  <a href=\"http://www.lgamerica.com/edelivery/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   I now see that Banner Life Insurance (Legal &amp; General America) partnered with DocuSign  </u>    </a> and I did an imaginary fist bump to them for their innovation. I realize there are eDocument services out there, but the proliferation of accessibility was out of my scope when I see the monster amounts of applications our firm receives each day. It got me to thinking, &ldquo;How many advisors even know this is offered out there?&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://images.esign.docusign.com/Web/DocuSign/%7B087201d2-2a90-4c34-a402-45ecbfcd6052%7D_Straight-Through_Processing_Whitepaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to DocuSign&rsquo;s blog  </a> </u> , they have this service available for more than 400 insurance companies &ndash; so why aren&rsquo;t we using this more often? Good gravy!</p><h3> Operating Costs</h3><p> <br/> When we can reduce operating costs, everyone wins. If I can stand at the store and buy a house, why can&rsquo;t a client stand in line at the supermarket and buy life insurance? It saves everyone time. Advisors, we all need to do a better job of asking for this important resource to be offered wherever we submit business.</p><h3> Missed Signatures</h3><p> <br/> The absolute WORST thing about taking applications is missing a signature. Anything which remotely can cause a hesitation in the buying cycle is considered unacceptable. With a service like DocuSign, we don&rsquo;t miss signatures and it keeps our clients in the buying funnel. Again, don&rsquo;t you want to have access to this type of resource wherever you&rsquo;re processing business?</p><h3> Less Headache</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s get to the bottom-line &ndash; this service creates a lot less headache. Clients are satisfied to know they are signing documents in a convenient, yet secure, manner and using a device of their choice. In my home purchase example, I signed documents via my iPhone as easily as my desktop email. At all times, I was in the buying funnel and I can&rsquo;t remember a moment of questioning, &ldquo;Do I really want this house?&rdquo; Instead, it was, &ldquo;I love buying my house, it&rsquo;s so convenient today!&rdquo; &lt;- That&rsquo;s where we need to be as an industry.</p><p> This is not a promotional piece for DocuSign &ndash; they did not ask me to write this. Nope. Instead, I&rsquo;m concerned we are not paying attention to innovative methods to answer the challenges we face as an industry. Ask for these types of services &ndash; they are there to help us be better financial services practitioners. If someone doesn&rsquo;t offer these types of services, ask them, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; or find another partner to work with who does.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-02 19:40:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-02 19:40:04.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_tGYpsPG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/clients-should-use-their-phone-to-sign-more-documents/\", \"post_id\": \"9008\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-02 19:40:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-02 19:40:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"clients-should-use-their-phone-to-sign-more-documents\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9007\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4282\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Clients-Should-Use-Their-Phone-to-Sign-More-Documents.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"547\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454515200,"author_id":441,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4124,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Prepared For the Tidal Wave Of Assets Going Into Robo-Advisor Programs?","link":"are-you-prepared-for-the-tidal-wave-of-assets-going-into-robo-advisor-programs","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Robo-advisory programs currently have $16 billion in assets but that&rsquo;s expected to skyrocket to $489 billion by 2019, according to November 2015 Cerulli Associates report.</h3><p> <br/> Should advisors ignore the Robo-Advisor like they did with the no-help/no-load companies or should they take a stance, be proactive and find more ways to retain the clients and assets they&rsquo;ve worked so diligently for?  Or, do they find a way to partner with the Robo-advisors and charge an advisory fee like they have with ETFs and no-load funds? The advisor has many options but they should have a clear understanding of the Robo-advisor programs, because it appears that this could be another tool to help their clients and themselves.</p><h3> <strong>  What is this Robo-Advisor fuss all about? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Who is their target market? What are the fees? What are their strengths and drawbacks? How many companies are involved in Robo-advising? What should advisors learn so they can speak intelligently to their clients about it?</p><p> <strong>  Younger investors from Gens X and Y, as studies have shown, prefer to stalk information online rather than meet people face to face. </strong> Most of them definitely do not trust the big banks and financial firms on Wall Street. That makes this demographic, and all the wealth it is set to earn and inherit, a natural target for this kind of online service. Adam Nash, the CEO of Wealthfront, a major player in the online advisory world, was quoted in Financial Advisor (FA) magazine in 2014.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve discovered over the last few years that this solution is immensely popular with young people,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Over 50% of our clients are under 35 and 85% are under 50. This is a generation that has grown up with computers. They know what software is good for and what it&rsquo;s not good for.&rdquo;  For financial advisors that want to help their clients&rsquo; children and grandchildren, Robo-advisory programs could be a big help. It&rsquo;s a win-win for young adults with smaller accounts and advisors that want to manage assets for the entire family, but not get burdened with excessive hand-holding with smaller accounts under $250,000. The Robo-advisor programs are a fraction of the management fees that most advisors charge their larger clients. You&rsquo;ll see more about those reduced fees later in this article.</p><h3> <strong>  This is the biggest thing that&rsquo;s happening in this world </strong> !</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Some financial pros claim that this is the biggest thing that&rsquo;s happening in the financial world. </strong> There is an onslaught of online investment management sites into the advisory space. Could this be the evolution of the financial services industry? Will a vast majority of advisors be doing this five to ten years from now? &ldquo;The one thing I can say is constant in our industry is change,&rdquo; states Neil Wood, President of Neil Wood Consulting and Best Selling author of The Best Practices of Successful Financial Advisors. &ldquo;The Robo-advisor programs may not be for people with more complex financial situations, but for those non-affluent millenials, the Robo-advisor programs are very inexpensive and are gaining rapid momentum. Just look at the minimum account size for three of the major players in the Robo programs. Betterment&rsquo;s minimum account size is zero, yes ZERO. Wealthfront&rsquo;s minimum account size is only $500 dollars. Both of these companies are excellent, offer highly sophisticated investment models and lead the industry in fund flows in the Robo-advisory world. The management fees for AUM ranges from .15 to .25% in many of these Robo-advisory programs. Vanguard&rsquo;s minimum account size on the other hand has a minimum of $100,000. Considering the excellent investment models you get with these companies at a fraction of the typical 1% fee, it makes these Robo-advisor programs very attractive.</p><h3> <strong>  Are the Gen X and Millennials the Forgotten Middle? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Some industry experts refer to this group as the forgotten middle among the investing public. <strong>  It is estimated that there are $32 trillion in investable assets in this country and 33% to 40% of that is in this forgotten middle. </strong> This is a huge opportunity for advisors and especially younger advisors as more of the senior advisors are retiring. &ldquo;One of the best strategic moves a senior advisor can make is to add several young advisors to their team. They can relate to people their age and that opens the door to the Millennials&rdquo; says Neil Wood, a 30-year veteran in the financial services industry.</p><p> The financial services industry is as competitive as ever and the quest for new clients and more assets is an ongoing threat from the competition of many advisors in the industry. But for the proactive advisors, there are many ways for advisors to strengthen the relationship with their current book of business that makes it nearly impossible for anyone or anything to steal their clients. But it will take extra effort, a crystal clear message that explains the value that the advisor brings to the relationship, a laser-beam focus and more than just an attitude of gratitude, although that certainly goes a long way.</p><h3> <strong>  The One Constant In Our Industry is Change </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Many clients want more from their advisors. </strong> They want to be certain that their relationship is strong and that the advisor knows what their greatest fears are instead of having a simple transaction relationship. They are also fee conscious. Does the advisor give them confidence that this is THE advisor that will take care of their families, living and health expenses and leave a legacy?  Building a legacy of trust is key to successful relationships and asset retention. Trust can be built and strengthened with a series of questions, then listening intently for the answers and other meaningful concerns. That&rsquo;s where consultative selling is a plus.  If done well, the families will trust that they are in good hands for their future plans. But to accomplish this, the advisor will need to go above and beyond what most mediocre advisors do.  The advisors that change with the times, sharpen their focus and welcome this group of investors, will open their practice to the trillions of dollars that will be transferred from one generation to the next within the next twenty years. This is another reason to add younger advisors to an aging practice. This younger generation is tech savvy and IF they decide to work with an advisor, they expect the same level of tech expertise.</p><p> <strong>  The aging advisor should consider partnering with millennials that can &ldquo;talk the talk and walk the walk&rdquo; with these younger generations. </strong> Unfortunately, 58% of advisors today still believe their business will look the same in 2025. Remember the stock jockeys of the 1970s-1990s that refused to embrace financial planning? Many call them dinosaurs that died with a change in the way our industry did business. There will always be new competitors in our industry. People want faster, cheaper, better, improved, more powerful and a so-called better mousetrap. Have faith and patience working with these younger generations.

{"original_id":4126,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Trust Is An Intelligent Choice","link":"trust-is-an-intelligent-choice","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Harvey J Loew</p><p> <strong>  In my 30 years applying behavioral sciences to organizations of various shapes and sizes, &ldquo;Emotional Intelligence&rdquo; (EQ) was often recognized as common sense, but not commonly practiced. </strong> The transition to its acceptability still varies depending on the particular business community. In my work with the Franklin Covey organization over the years,  Stephen R. Covey did not speak of EQ per se in his seminal work on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, or other teachings that I am aware of, but he did speak of common sense quite often.</p><p> The choice to trust or not trust was brought to the forefront and well researched by his son Stephen M.R. Covey. It has common sensibilities and may have a place in the field of EQ. The adage, &ldquo;Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me,&rdquo; represents people&rsquo;s reactions to real experiences. The same goes for, &ldquo;Once burned, twice cautious.&rdquo; We also know that levels of tolerance or thick-skinned reactions can be situational&mdash;what the late Steven R. Covey might deem dependent on an emotional bank account of a relationship. One could suggest that if positive experiences were high in any relationship, the bank account would have sufficient assets to sustain withdrawals or to extend trust. However, if experience or familiarity of the relationship was thin, there may not be sufficient funds or occurrences in that emotional bank account to warrant or extend trust.</p><h3> Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that distrust is very expensive.</h3><p> <br/> This was before Sarbanes-Oxley and 9/11.  In The Speed of Trust, Stephen M.R. Covey shows how trust is economic, not soft, but hard, real and measurable. Covey suggests that when trust is high, it acts like a dividend and multiplier. The speed for getting things done occurs more quickly and the cost is low. Conversely, when trust is low it operates as a tax; the speed of delivery is slow, the cost high. These days we are likely more vocal of the fallout from higher financial taxes than the high emotional taxes in our relationships.</p><h3> How would you consider trust levels at your jobs, with colleagues, management, etc?</h3><p> <br/> What about your social contacts or within your extended families? I imagine in some contexts it would be a dividend and others a tax. Reflecting on your own experience with trust and your relationships, here is a simple exercise you can do for yourself:</p><li> <strong>  Identify a person at work or in your personal life with whom you have a high-trust relationship </strong></li><li> <strong>  Identify a person at work or your personal life with whom you have a low-trust relationship </strong> <br/>  </li><li> What is the relationship like with each of these people?</li><li> How long does it take to get things done?</li><li> What is communication like?</li><li> How would you describe the strain, tension or stress that exists?</li><li> What kind of results are you able to achieve? <br/>  </li><p> In the Covey lexicon, trust is rooted in Credibility, which is determined by Character, represented by Integrity, Intent (motive) and Competence, evidenced by capabilities and results. All are necessary to trust (and be trusted), because if one is off, trust may erode.</p><h3> One of the more difficult things to do, but I&rsquo;ve seen it done, is to forgive and allow trust to be restored that was broken.</h3><p> <br/> The work of Dr. Fred Luskin on forgiveness is somewhat related to the Covey notion of righting wrongs, one of the behaviors for developing or restoring trust. (Forgiving and allowing someone to restore their trust according to Gandhi, is attributed to the strong, not the weak.) While it may seem counterintuitive, people often have a difficult time forgiving and trusting (themselves and others). We all have had experiences of beating ourselves up over one thing or another, but it&rsquo;s important to restore trust with oneself and demonstrate the self respect you wish to garner from others.</p><p> Covey suggests a number of approaches with self and others that might be helpful in situations you encounter: a) talk straight&hellip;and tell it like it is; b) create transparencies by being open and honest about your motives; c) right wrongs where possible; d) show loyalty&hellip;especially not talking about others negatively when they are not present; e) deliver results; f) confront reality and don&rsquo;t avoid or blame; g) clarify expectations upfront; h) practice accountability; i) keep commitments.</p><p> <strong>  Stephen R. Covey once said </strong> , &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t talk your way out of a problem you&rsquo;ve behaved your way into&hellip;.and junior responded&hellip;that&rsquo;s true, but you can behave yourself out of a problem you&rsquo;ve behaved yourself into and often faster than you think.&rdquo;</p><h3> There are two extremes (looking at the bell-shaped curve) and both can be costly: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Blind trust </strong> &mdash;being gullible, simplistic and na&iuml;ve.</li><li> <strong>  Not trusting enough </strong> &mdash;being overly suspicious and highly skeptical. <br/>  </li><p> Covey responded to the polarity by suggesting there is smart trust in the sweet spot of the curve, where good judgment is rendered.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-03 14:41:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-03 14:41:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_T2FCmrJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/trust-is-an-intelligent-choice/\", \"post_id\": \"9013\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-03 14:41:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-03 14:41:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"trust-is-an-intelligent-choice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9012\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4285\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trust-Is-An-Intelligent-Choice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"690\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454605200,"author_id":46,"chart_url":""}

Rebounds following the recessions averaged 62 percent&mdash;80 percent following the 2007 financial crisis.</p><h3> How to Invest When Stocks Make You Worry</h3><p> <br/> Whether or not a recession is imminent, I believe it&rsquo;s a good idea for investors to be prepared by having a well-diversified portfolio, including assets such as gold and municipal bonds. Gold has tended to have a low correlation with stocks, meaning that even when stocks were tumbling, it&rsquo;s managed to retain its value well. The same can be said for short-term, high-quality munis, which have been shown to offer a greater amount of stability than some other types of securities, even during market downturns.</p><p> In 2015, munis, as represented by the Barclays Municipal Bond Index, were actually the top fixed-income asset class, beating both Treasuries and corporate debt. They also outperformed S&amp;P 500 Index stocks, returning more than double what equities delivered.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-29/COMM-muni-bonds-outperformed-other-major-bond-categories-in-2015-01292016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Muni Bonds Outperformed Other Major Bond Categories in 2015\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-29/COMM-muni-bonds-outperformed-other-major-bond-categories-in-2015-01292016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Muni fund inflows gained momentum in the second half of 2015 as global stock markets began to show signs of trouble, and so far this year, investors are piling into munis at a rate of about $1 billion per week.</p><p> The last couple of decades were among the most volatile, with the tech bubble and financial crisis challenging markets. Out of more than 31,000 equity and bond funds during this 21-year period, only 0.12 percent of the total number, made up almost completely of municipal and short-term bond funds, managed to delivered positive returns on a consistent basis.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/interactive/why-investing-in-short-term-municipal-bonds-makes-sense-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn more about the $3.7 trillion muni market!  </a> </u></p><h3> Did Russia Just Blink?</h3><p> <br/> Several forecasts last week suggest oil prices are unlikely to recover in 2016&mdash;and might fall even further.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-29/COMM-russia-ready-to-reach-an-oil-production-deal-with-saudi-arabia-01292016.jpg\"/><p> Morgan Stanley says crude could reach $20 per barrel as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that we might not see supply and demand start to rebalance and prices recover until late 2017. And the World Bank lowered its 2016 forecast for crude oil prices, from $51 per barrel on average to $37 per barrel. The downward revision is based on a number of factors, including sooner-than-expected oil exports from Iran, a mild winter in the Northern Hemisphere and, most significantly, continued imbalance between global supply and demand. U.S. producers have been much more resilient than expected to lower oil prices.</p><p> But talk that meaningful production cuts are on the horizon led oil higher last week, helping it achieve its first three-day winning streak of the new year. In the global production staring contest, it appears as if Russia blinked first, as it just expressed an interest in reaching terms with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on output cuts.</p><p> Like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iraq and Venezuela, Russia greatly depends on oil exports, the revenue from which makes up about half of its government&rsquo;s total revenue. The country averaged 10.5 million barrels a day in 2014, making it the world&rsquo;s third-largest oil producer after the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Coupled with Western sanctions for its involvement in Ukraine, low prices have wreaked havoc on Russia&rsquo;s economy, which contracted 3.7 percent in 2015 and is expected to fall another 1 percent this year. The ruble, which closely tracks the decline in Brent oil, has lost approximately half its value against the U.S. dollar in the last two years.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-29/COMM-russian-ruble-has-tracked-brent-oil-decline-01292016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Russian Ruble Has Tracked Brent Oil's Decline\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-01-29/COMM-russian-ruble-has-tracked-brent-oil-decline-01292016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Reaching a production cap deal with OPEC, whose members are collectively responsible for about 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s output, would help rebalance supply and demand and firm up prices.</p><p> Oil has historically bottomed in the month of January, and it appears that we finally found a bottom. It remains under pressure, but we could see oil climb to between $38 and $40 per barrel over the next three months.</p><p> In the longer term, things look more constructive.

An abundance of crop production meant that many of the goods produced were too common to trade with bartering.  As a result, the government of the day created money that could be used to buy goods and services, in exchange for the wheat, maize and barley produced by the farmers.  If money had not been invented, the farming system would have caused riots, as bartering became unworkable.  How could I trade wheat for barley when everyone had barley and wheat?</p><p> The basis of the first great revolution therefore &ndash; <strong>  the Agricultural Revolution </strong> &ndash; was the creation of governance through money.  It is the reason why I regularly state you cannot have money without government, because money was created for governance.</p><p> <strong>  Throughout this period of the last five millennia, not a great deal changed. </strong>   Money was typically backed by government, and issued by government, and backed by value in the form of gold and silver.  Gold and silver is heavy however and, as trade began to explode during the next great revolution, the Industrial Revolution, a new form of money was needed.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1_10.png\" width=\"553\"/></p><p> <strong>  So the second great revolution in commerce took place as people moved from fields to factories. </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2_11.png\" width=\"552\"/></p><p> Trade across borders and nations needed a new form of finance: trade finance.  It is the reason why so many banks appeared during the Industrial Revolution, as it was realised that companies could not trade without a new form of system.  Bear in mind that there were no large enterprises, big firms, major companies prior to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/oldest-companies-on-earth-2014-8?op=1&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Industrial Revolution  </a> </u> .  The oldest surviving firms on  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/10/oldest-companies-fortune-500/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the Fortune 500  </a> </u>  for example are all under 250 years old, with the oldest being banks (BNY Mellon) and Insurance firms (Cigna).</p><p> In fact, this holds true generally, as the oldest surviving companies in most markets are the banks and insurance companies created during the Industrial Revolution.  These firms were created to enable companies to grow and expand across borders and continents.  They offered trade finance to grow the business and insurance to cover loss of goods due to any unforeseen circumstance.  The key to this system was that it could be trusted because governments gave these companies licenses to trade, and it was the government-backed guarantee that allowed these institutions to offer cheques and banknotes that could be trusted by traders.</p><p> This system has been around over 300 years, and was the great innovation in commerce that backed the Industrial Revolution, going hand-in-hand with the great innovation in commerce that backed the Agricultural Revolution: money.  Money led to Banking and Insurance, but Banking and Insurance was unnecessary in an age of localised trade.  Banking and Insurance only became a requirement as businesses grew across borders and regions.</p><p> Some would claim we haven&rsquo;t really had another revolution since, although the move from factories to offices could be claimed as one big change, as is the move from steam power to electrical power.  The move from blue collar to white collar led to another change in commerce, as we saw people needing more convenient forms of payment.  At this point the card appeared.  The bank card for credit and then debit gave us an easier form of payment than paying by cheque or cash, but no, I would not claim this was a revolution in commerce.  More an evolution.</p><p> Now I&rsquo;ve written a lot about this history  <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2009/11/are-bankers-good-or-bad-for-society-part-one.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   before  </a>  , </u>  so don&rsquo;t want to repeat it all again.  However, it is worth giving that backdrop, as we are living through another revolution in commerce today.  The internet age is clearly a revolution in trade and business.  The fact that we now have companies that are not just trading across borders or regions, but trading as global platforms and global marketplaces for all citizens of the world is clearly a massive change in size and structure.</p><p> Just look at the news this morning about Google and Facebook and it&rsquo;s clear to see that business has changed through the internet age.</p><li> Facebook-owned WhatsApp boasts  <u>  <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-02-facebook-owned-whatsapp-billion-users.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a billion users  </a> </u>  (and Facebook Messenger passes  <u>  <a href=\"http://recode.net/2016/01/07/facebook-messenger-keeps-trucking-passes-800-million-users/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   800 million users  </a> </u> )</li><li> Google has 7 products with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/google-has-7-products-with-1-billion-users\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1 billion users  </a> </u>  (it&rsquo;s also now more valuable than Apple)</li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3_8.png\" width=\"549\"/></p><h3> This is why we talk about firms like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Yandex, Amazon, Apple and more, as these are the new global entities emerging through the Internet Revolution. </h3><p> <br/> This is the Third Age, the Third Revolution, the  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">  Digital Revolution </a> .  The world is networked and connected, and everyone is now able to trade 1:1 in real-time.</p><p> Soon, it&rsquo;s not just people trading but their machines in the Internet of Things.  As we move from 1:1 to M:M, the infrastructure of commerce that backs the network demands change too.  This is why the system we created for the last Revolution &ndash; banking and insurance &ndash; cannot just evolve into this new age, but has to be reimagined.</p><p> The instruments to reimagine financial services are already appearing &ndash; cloud, shared ledgers, data analytics, APIs &ndash; but this reimagining will take years.  This is not an overnight change.  After all, the Industrial Revolution took over three centuries to bubble and burst; we are just over half a century into the Digital Revolution.</p><p> Unlike the other changes through the Industrial Age &ndash; mechanical to electronic to digital &ndash; the  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age\" target=\"_blank\">   Information Age  </a> </u>  demands fast and (near) free value exchange in global platforms, rather than slow and expensive exchange in local systems.  During the Industrial Revolution, we built an efficient exchange system in the form of cash backed by gold and silver to cheques and cards backed by government-licenced banks; but today, we need a new system.  A new fast and cheap system for machines to trade with machines in real-time for near free.</p><p> Whether that system is based on existing banks and insurance companies is open to question, as this system will be digital and based on the internet.  That much is clear.   Banking and insurance is being reimagined by the internet1.  The Digital Revolution that has created the Information Age demands a new system of commerce.   The new system is what we are now calling the Internet of Value or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ValueWeb-Chris-Skinner/dp/9814677175/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453905389&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=valueweb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ValueWeb  </a> </u> , which just happens to be the title of  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ValueWeb-Chris-Skinner/dp/9814677175/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453905389&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=valueweb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   my new book  </u>  . </a></p><p> What a shameless plug, and there will be more, but the reason for talking about this as a Revolution in trade and commerce and finance, is that most think it&rsquo;s just another evolution.

Bowling is all about the averages. Some games are good, some are bad; if your average keeps improving or increasing, consider that progress. The score matters; and as long as the general trend is up, you're in great shape.</p><p> In bowling, inconsistencies in your performance can lead you to not even achieve your average every time you play. But the average doesn't tell you the reason behind the inconsistencies or what the issues were with your game.</p><p> That experience and the weekly focus on the average got me thinking about what's so special about averages.</p><h3> I have two trains of thought when it comes to this topic: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  the metrics angle, and </strong></li><li> <strong>  the \"being average is boring\" angle </strong> <br/>  </li><p> In some ways, they go hand in hand. </p><h3> The Metrics Angle</h3><p> <br/> On average, our retention rate is up 5% in the region this quarter. </p><p> That's not very helpful. Which states or cities were up? Which were down? How did different segments fare? What were the percentages by month? Which weeks were better/worse?

I know that the temperature in Phoenix can reach the 120s in the summer; and in the winter, I know temperatures can be half of that. What are the extremes, and do I want to endure either of them?</p><p> If you're reporting your metrics (satisfaction, effort, etc.) as mean scores, they can be meaningless because they are just that, a mean or an average, i.e., an aggregation of many different ratings divided by the number of responses. The same mean can be achieved with different sets of numbers, e.g. the average of 9+9+9 is 9, but then so is the average of 10+7+10. Because of that, it's actually more meaningful to look at the distribution of ratings/responses to get a real understanding of your customers' diverse sentiments. If you report means, be sure to look at distributions (and comments), too. Otherwise, you might miss some nuggets hiding behind the mean, like, are there outliers and why?</p><p> The other thing that can happen as a result of only looking at the mean is that it often  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/03/its-not-about-metric.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   becomes just a metric  </a> </u> , a number to chase. But as I pointed out, you can achieve that metric in many different ways. So bypassing the mean and looking at the distribution (and the verbatim explanations) allows you to take the focus off the metric and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/09/putting-customer-at-center-of-every.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   put it on the customer  </a> </u> , again, the varying sentiments across the response base.</p><p> Perhaps these quotes help to illuminate the flaws of averages:</p><p> <strong>  Being average means you are as close to the bottom as you are to the top. -John Wooden </strong></p><p> <strong>  Never cross a river that is, on average, four feet deep; you will drown. -Simon Lyons </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you have one foot on burning coals and one foot in a bucket of ice water, on average, you are comfortable. -Unknown </strong></p><p> Averages just don't give us enough detail.

Being average means that you're, well, middle of the road. Mediocre. Some brands are better; some are worse; some are average: a level that is typical of a group, class, or series; a middle point between extremes (per  <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/average\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Merriam-Webster </a> ).</p><p> Typical.

I wrote it down as one of my top ten goals for 2015.</p><p> When January 2016 came around, I wrote the goal down again. But this time I added &ldquo;Best Selling&rdquo; author. I even put a picture of the bestselling author label on my vision board where I could see it every day.</p><p> It still seems surreal to me that our book became a bestseller in just one day.</p><p> Never underestimate the power of a goal. Especially when you write it down.</p><h3> 2. Get a mentor to guide you.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ll be honest. Had I not hired a mentor to help me write for this book project, it may have never happened. There are just too many details involved that could have easily overwhelmed me. I would have gotten frustrated and possibly quit the whole project midway.</p><p> Hiring a writing coach was key for me in completing the project. Hiring the right coach made all the difference.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.jillhendrickson.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jill Hendrickson  </u>    </a> is a fabulous writing coach and editor to work with. She makes the writing process feel so natural and easy, minimizing much of the resistance that would normally come up in publicizing your work.</p><p> I highly recommend her services for anyone wanting to write their book.</p><h3> 3. The importance of accountability.</h3><p> <br/> Had I not had the milestones set forth for me by my writing coach and editor, I might have let the busyness of life get in the way of making the completion of this project possible.</p><p> Having those deadlines imposed upon me made me comply, sitting down to write even when it was the last thing I wanted to do.</p><p> Being too tired, uninspired or too busy to write, was no longer an option. Writer&rsquo;s block or not, I knew I HAD to sit down and write.</p><h3> 4. The power of community.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve never written a book, it can be an intimidating experience. Especially for someone like me who doesn&rsquo;t feel all that confident in the quality of their work.</p><p> Knowing I had thirteen visionary sisters who were penning their stories alongside me, felt supportive in a way that kept pulling me forward.</p><p> Had I not felt the support of the group, I might have been tempted to throw in the towel at times when I was feeling particularly unworthy or unqualified to be included in this book project.</p><p> The collective spirit of the other thought leaders involved was felt and appreciated every step of the way.</p><p> When attempting to do something bigger than yourself, gathering others of like-mind and working in community makes it less overwhelming, more doable and more enjoyable.</p><h3> 5. Always acknowledge your dreams and desires.</h3><p> <br/> Becoming a published author has been a secret dream of mine for a while. I&rsquo;ve shared the dream with a few key people in my life. Although some were supportive, others were not.</p><p> In the face of disapproval, I could have found plenty of reason to abandon my dream.</p><p> As time went on and it didn&rsquo;t happen, it would have been easy to let the dream die.</p><p> However, I kept believing in my heart that it would happen. I knew somehow I would make it happen. The desire was just too strong for it not to.</p><p> I have to tell you, it feels SO amazing to finally be on this side of the dream now accomplished.</p><p> I am so excited that I am now a bestselling author. That&rsquo;s the goal I wrote down.</p><p> Never underestimate the power of your dreams. Especially when you turn one into a goal written down with a deadline.</p><p> <strong>  Go after your dreams! They are meant for YOU! </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-03 17:14:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-03 17:14:12.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_eCnax4H.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-lessons-i-learned-becoming-a-best-selling-author/\", \"post_id\": \"9022\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-03 17:14:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-03 17:14:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-lessons-i-learned-becoming-a-best-selling-author\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9021\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4289\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-Lessons-I-Learned-Becoming-a-Best-Selling-Author.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"537\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454616000,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4131,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Ways To Influence Without A Title","link":"five-ways-to-influence-without-a-title","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The topic of influence often comes up during many of the discussions in my  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/services/#sthash.b6AtGJYf.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  leadership workshops </a> . Both team leaders and team members want to feel heard and want to impact the direction a team chooses. This week in my program we focused on how to be more influential without necessarily having a title or position. We began the day by answering the question:</p><p> &ldquo;Who has been influential to you in your life and what made them influential?&rdquo;</p><h3> The responses were fascinating:</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;My mom has been the biggest influence on me. She is the strongest person I know and always stays positive.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;My boss in my last job was highly influential for me. Through his patience, he taught me all the technical pieces of the job. He never lost his cool.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;My tenth grade English teacher had a profound influence on me. She helped me break out of my introverted shell and got me involved in the school newspaper and writing.&rdquo;</p><h3> So who has been the most influential person in your life?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  To be strong leaders we need to understand how we influence others and how other people see us. </strong> It helps to have a working definition of influence.</p><p> Influence is the ability to persuade someone to act or to think the way you want.</p><p> <strong>  Here are five influential strategies to try: </strong></p><h3> <strong>  1. BE AUTHENTIC AND HONEST </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is no way we can be influential without following through on what we say we are going to do.</p><li> If we say we will help out on a project, make sure to set time aside to do it</li><li> When we offer suggestions, be truthful in what your ideas are all about</li><li> Avoid a hidden agenda</li><li> Giving  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2012/10/22/how-to-unlock-your-feedback-style/#sthash.eAwdWbyh.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   truthful feedback  </a> </u>  and opinions goes a far way to showing others that we care <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  2. SWITCH THE FOCUS FROM YOU TO THEM </strong></h3><p> <br/> When we speak with others, think about what is important to them. That does not mean we shouldn&rsquo;t promote our ideas but rather think of how our strategies can solve their issues. Ask how we can help them improve their challenges using some of our techniques. People are turned off to a pushy salesperson but will listen to someone who they perceive cares about their needs. For example, if a team member is struggling to complete a technical assignment and we know a better way to approach it, offer your idea in terms of &ldquo;something that may be helpful&rdquo;. Never say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it wrong.&rdquo; No team member will ever listen to that phrase or anything else we have to say.</p><h3> <strong>  3. SHARE YOUR STRENGTHS AND EXPERTISE </strong></h3><p> <br/> We gain influence when we have knowledge and experience to share.</p><li> Become the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; person in a particular area for your team, colleagues or organization</li><li> Be  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/04/13/four-ways-to-lead-with-loyalty/#sthash.Kks6q5yE.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   generous  </a> </u>  but not arrogant in how you offer your information</li><li> Promote your perspectives through interesting storytelling</li><li> Empower the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; inside of you by continually learning and growing <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. BRAINSTORM SOLUTIONS </strong></h3><p> <br/> When we lead by bringing people and their ideas together, we become more influential. Leaders who are effective in pulling together many possible solutions to a problem will influence through the final decision. The important skill here is knowing how to  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2016/01/10/8-ways-to-lead-your-best-collaboration-ever/#sthash.OamxWDZQ.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  lead a collaboration </a>  where everybody feels part of the end result.</p><h3> <strong>  5. MATCH YOUR BODY WITH YOUR MESSAGE </strong></h3><p> <br/> An important way we also influence is though our non-verbal cues. Essential to making our point, is the ability to match our body movements, hand gestures and facial expressions with our message. Confidence plays a big factor in being influential and we display this through our tone, smile and posture. The next time you observe an influential person, take note of their body and how it complements their words.</p><p> How have you become an influential leader?

That said; it&rsquo;s still probably worth giving this question a bit of thought beforehand, just in case it does crop up and you end up blurting out an answer which takes you out of the running for the job you&rsquo;re interviewing for. <strong>  When trying to come up with a decent answer to this interview question, there are a few things you need to bear in mind; </strong></p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Overthink It</h3>As with any interview questions, with a question like this, it goes without saying that you want to give the best answer you could possibly give&hellip; but you need to be careful not to spend too long trying to think up the perfect answer. Why? Because with a question like this there is no &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; answer because it all comes down to personal opinion&hellip; and by spending five minutes umm-ing and ah-ing, it might suggest to the employer that you&rsquo;re incapable of making quick decisions.<h3> Be Honest</h3>Whichever answer you give, try and be honest and ensure your answer reflects who you are as a person. That said; don&rsquo;t suck up and give the answer which you think might impress them the most eg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d choose to be able to stop time so I can get more work done in each day&rdquo;. This answer is just downright cringey and while the employer might smile to your face, inside they&rsquo;re probably rolling their eyes because they know that you&rsquo;re not really being honest.<h3> Have A Reason Ready</h3>With this question, you always need to have an answer and a credible reason to hand. Remember, with these types of questions, the employer isn&rsquo;t necessarily interested in your answer &ndash; but rather the reason behind your answer &ndash; because this gives an insight into who you are as a person. That said; be sure to have a credible reason for your choice &ndash; one that you believe in and which you can stand by if you&rsquo;re challenged.<h3> Try &amp; Relate It Back To The Role You&rsquo;re Being Interviewed For</h3>OK, so I know earlier I said that you shouldn&rsquo;t give an answer which sucks up to the employer &ndash; but with a question like this, if you can relate your answer back to the job without going overboard on the cheese, then go for it. An example? You could say you&rsquo;d love to be able to be in two places at once so you can get a real insight into how a client&rsquo;s business works, while completing work on their behalf&hellip; See, not that cheesy at all, huh?!<h3> Judge The Situation</h3>With these types of interview questions, the best answer you can give is ultimately going to depend on who your interviewer is and what the situation is. For example, if you&rsquo;re being interviewed by someone who&rsquo;s very corporate and is conducting a very serious interview, it&rsquo;s probably best to play it safe and give a sensible answer. On the other hand, if your interview is pretty laid back &ndash; and your interviewer keeps making jokes, it&rsquo;s probably OK to give a jokey answer which you think will appeal to the interviewer.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-03 17:31:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-03 17:31:23.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_HxekrvA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-answer-if-you-could-choose-one-super-power-what-would-it-be-why/\", \"post_id\": \"9025\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-03 17:31:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-03 17:31:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-answer-if-you-could-choose-one-super-power-what-would-it-be-why\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9023\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4291\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Five-Ways-To-Influence-Without-A-Title.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1667\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454606100,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4133,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: Seven Simple Tips for Writing Effective Content for Your Website","link":"advisors-seven-simple-tips-for-writing-effective-content-for-your-website","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  The Internet is the first place most people look when they&rsquo;re researching financial advisors. </strong> That&rsquo;s why every financial advisor needs a sleek and informative website that is at once personalized and professional. Here are 10 simple tips for writing effective content for your website.</p><h3> Include a Short Biography</h3><p> <br/> Your website should include a short, well-written biography that lets prospective clients know a little bit about you. The key word here is &ldquo;little&rdquo;; don&rsquo;t overdo it. Keep your bio short &ndash; around 300 words or so &ndash; so that readers don&rsquo;t get bored or feel as if they&rsquo;re reading your life&rsquo;s story. When it comes to writing a biography, make sure to include your educational background, career highlights, areas of specialty, and any other information that you think might peak someone&rsquo;s interest and make you stand out from the competition; but remember to keep it short and to the point, and make sure you don&rsquo;t include any personal information that you would not be comfortable sharing on the Internet.</p><p> Your website is often the first point of contact for prospective clients, which you means you want to make a good first impression and put your best foot forward.</p><h3> Keep It Simple</h3><p> <br/> The best way to write effective content for your website is to keep it simple. Keep your sentences short and direct, and avoid using overly metaphorical or figurative language in your writing, as it may confuse your readers. Similarly, don&rsquo;t use a lot of jargon on your website: write for a general, non-specialist audience. In other words, don&rsquo;t alienate your audience.</p><h3> Skimming and Scanning</h3><p> <br/> Most Internet users only skim a website&rsquo;s content, rather than reading each and every paragraph word for word. One of the biggest mistakes that Advisors are making is treating their web copy like print copy. In reality, web copy is read completely differently than print; only 16% of visitors read word by word. Organize your paragraphs around one central idea so that even if your readers are only skimming, they&rsquo;ll be able to pick up on key points. Don&rsquo;t take too long getting to the point either; just keep your writing simple and direct.</p><h3> Look Like a Pro</h3><p> <br/> You should include a high-quality, professionally-taken photograph on your website. &ldquo;Selfies&rdquo; are a definite no-no. Remember: your website is the number one place where people will go to find out about your business and the services you offer, so you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that it looks professional. That means getting your headshot taken by a professional photographer, and including only high-quality, non-pixelated images on your webpage.</p><h3> Do Some Research</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re not sure how you want your website to look, why not browse other financial advisors&rsquo; websites to get an idea of what&rsquo;s out there? The more research you do, the better you&rsquo;ll understand what kind of website you want to build. You&rsquo;ll also get a sense of what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p><h3> Hire a Pro</h3><p> <br/> Many people will hire a professional web designer, but they won&rsquo;t hire a professional writer. Ever go to a website that looks great but is full of grammar and spelling mistakes and bad, incomprehensible writing?

Or perhaps, like me, you're a Millennial yourself?</p><p> Whichever demographic you belong to, there's a 99.99% chance you've come across an article on managing workforce Millennials. And, in the words of Rich Homie Quan, it \"made you feel some type of way.\"</p><p> If that last reference made sense to you, by the way, you're in all likelihood a Millennial. If you have a dumbfounded grimace on your face right now, you're definitely a Boomer.</p><p> Which goes to this article's point, of course, though I don't need to tell you there are major generation gaps affecting our workplace. Nor do I need to bore you with the same trite \"How to do [x] with Millennials.\"</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1DJgIpL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Been there  </a> </u> .  <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Ch9XKv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Done that  </a> </u> .</p><p> Instead, I want to tell you 3 true stories about Millennial colleagues of mine I hope you'll find to be revealing, insightful and at times humorous glimpses into what makes the Millennial workforce tick.</p><h3> M <strong>  anaging Millennials: Three Real-Life Parables </strong></h3><p> <br/> These three stories, in a nutshell, are microcosms of greater trends amongst the Millennial workforce:</p><li> Lack of direction and discipline.</li><li> Frustration with coaching, training and professional development.</li><li> Desire for passion about our product/service, company and role. <br/>  </li><p> Scores of nodding, pissed-off Boomer and Gen-X managers agree.</p><h3> <strong>  True Story One </strong></h3><p> <br/> Fresh out of college, a Millennial colleague of mine got an interview with a prominent local advertising firm.</p><p> His friend, then a current-intern with the company, vouched for Mr. Millennial as a solid candidate for an entry level Ad Exec position. All parties were optimistic.</p><p> Then the interview happened.</p><p> 20 minutes in, everything&rsquo;s going smoothly, when the recruiter asks our friend: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest professional weakness?&rdquo;</p><p> Mr. Millennial stared thoughtfully for a moment, before uttering, &ldquo;Consistency. Sometimes I&rsquo;m there, and sometimes I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p><p> The interview ended abruptly shortly thereafter.</p><p> My colleague didn&rsquo;t get an offer, but to his credit, he did tell the truth. One that applies to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   large swath of the largest workforce demographic in America  </a> </u> . </p><p> And should any Boomer out there mock him for lack of expediency, you first need to answer for the staggering callowness of this year's Presidential candidates. At least Mr. Millennial tells it like it is. </p><h3> <strong>  True Story Two </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another old college buddy of mine paid me a visit a few weeks ago.</p><p> We talked about our jobs for a while. He'd spent now more than 3 years at his current company - his first out of college - and when pressed about his satisfaction with his current role, he confessed:</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy. Last week, my boss (middle-aged, ex-Navy) yelled at me because a girl I manage wouldn&rsquo;t get off her cell phone during her shift. I didn&rsquo;t graduate college to become a professional hall monitor.&rdquo;</p><p> Go on, I urged him.</p><p> &ldquo;The real problem is, one, this guy is a big-time yeller -- which is something I don&rsquo;t respond to. He pulled me into his office the other day and berated me because my team hadn&rsquo;t moved our outdoor equipment into its proper staging area when a thunderstorm hit.</p><p> I asked him, &lsquo;Okay, what should I have done differently?&rsquo;</p><p> &lsquo;LEAD THEM!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> But  <u>  like many managers out there </u> , my colleague's boss hadn't done a thing to teach him how to lead his Millennial peers. And my buddy not only had no prior leadership, he detested the responsibilities that consisted \"leadership\" in that particular role. </p><p> Worst of all, he also saw a ceiling lowering on his growth potential within that particular company.</p><p> Three works after our visit, my buddy texted me and let me know he'd put in his two weeks notice. After 3+ years, he was leaving the company. </p><h3> <strong>  True Story Three </strong></h3><p> <br/> A (very) close female colleague of mine, another Advertising Executive, got a well-paying job providing marketing and advertising services for casinos.</p><p> Ms. Millennial, let&rsquo;s call her, was already a model of professional excellence by the time she entered the workforce. Industrious, driven, charming and incredibly sharp on her feet, she was every employer&rsquo;s dream.</p><p> There was just one problem: She had zero passion for her key professional objective - help casinos lure more gamblers into their gaming halls.</p><p> When a similar opportunity with Facebook opened up, she couldn&rsquo;t apply fast enough, and is now much happier helping businesses excel in their social media marketing efforts.</p><p> Like  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugsmHqlriVc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Don Draper swearing off the tobacco industry  </a> </u> , the move was also a savvy one for Ms. Millennial's career. She's thinking about the future, digital marketing, as opposed to the past, digital billboards.</p><p> Facebook&rsquo;s office, by the way,  <u>  has its own bar </u> . The previous employer didn&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p><h3> <strong>  Help Save the Millennials </strong></h3><p> <br/> These are just three of thousands upon thousands more true stories impacting the workplace.</p><p> Millennials can be a difficult bunch to hire, manage, train and retain, but as I wrote in an open letter to  <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1FMVHut\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff  </a> </u>  the other week, there's a great opportunity here for Millennials and their managers alike to get on the same page and maximize Gen-Y's potential.</p><p> Join our movement at  <u>  <a href=\"http://savethemillennials.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   savethemillennials.com  </a> </u>  and pledge your organization's commitment to helping save this important new generation in our workforce.</p><p> We're the future leaders of the global workforce, and we need all the help we can get.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-03 18:45:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-03 18:45:08.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_TNAozLM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/3-insightful-true-stories-about-millennials-in-the-workforce/\", \"post_id\": \"9031\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-03 18:45:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-03 18:45:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"3-insightful-true-stories-about-millennials-in-the-workforce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9030\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4294\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3-Insightful-True-Stories-About-Millennials-in-the-Workforce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"841\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454612400,"author_id":228,"chart_url":""}

Do you think many are confused about when to schedule an appointment with a physician?  </p><p> In our recent Q2 2015 Affluent Consumer Research, we asked the following question:</p><h3> At what level of assets do you think a person needs a financial advisor?</h3><p> <br/> Common sense would suggest that the answer would be fairly straightforward; at some higher level of assets &ldquo;financial advice&rdquo; is sought after.  As you can see in the chart below, the responses are all over the place.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-04-at-8.41.39-AM-2_0.png\" width=\"632\"/></p><h3> Unbelievable!  </h3><p> <br/> The good news is that only 1% of the largest future economic force, Millennials, say they will &ldquo;never&rdquo; need a financial advisor.  However, the above chart serves to highlight the confusion the affluent consumer has regarding financial advisors.  Who is a financial advisor?  What services do they provide?  When do I need their services?  Is hiring a Robo-advisor the equivalent of hiring a financial advisor?  These questions go on and on.</p><p> Can it be that the billions of dollars financial firms are currently spending on advertising is confusing the exact market they are targeting?  It certainly appears that way.  The ads mostly show vague images of retirees and families with Labradors.  It&rsquo;s not like they say &ldquo;contact us if you have or will soon have $250,000.&rdquo;  Advertising to today&rsquo;s affluent consumer is a tricky business.   The chart below provides a glimpse into &ldquo;truth in advertising&rdquo; from the affluent perspective.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-04-at-8.42.23-AM-2.png\" width=\"636\"/></p><p> What&rsquo;s the takeaway with all of this?  From an affluent consumer&rsquo;s perspective, advertisements that paint a perfect scenario without an ounce of specifics might seem confusing, vague, and somewhat disconnected from reality. Confusion breeds distrust.  </p><h3> So what should financial advisors do?  </h3><p> <br/> Make certain that you are meeting with the millennial children of your affluent clients &ndash; whether they (or their parents) see it as immediately necessary.  Remember - they don&rsquo;t really know when they need you.</p><p> Only 21% of today&rsquo;s affluent say their financial advisor expressed interest in working with their children.  Reassess your minimum standards for the family unit.  Think about the size/growth of these accounts in 5 years, not how they look today.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, the odds are that many of today&rsquo;s Millennials living in the same areas where they grew up are using the same dentist they visited growing up.  But only 20% are using their parent&rsquo;s financial advisor (probably of the 21% who expressed an interest).</p><p> According to their affluent parents, from a combination of earnings and inheritance, many of today&rsquo;s Millennials are going to be tomorrow&rsquo;s affluent client with well over $1 million of investable assets.  This should be a priority for financial advisors.  </p><h3> Take the confusion and ambiguity out of the services you offer.  </h3><p> <br/> The more time you spend with your affluent clients (and children), the less their confusion and greater their trust &ndash; in you.  Where the next generation first receives their financial advice, is likely to be where they&rsquo;ll get it in the future.  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 16:45:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 16:45:36.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_xjqGlfU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/who-needs-a-financial-advisor/\", \"post_id\": \"9038\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 16:45:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 16:45:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"who-needs-a-financial-advisor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9034\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4297\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/David-Bowie-\\u2014-Estate-Planning-Genius.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"716\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454662800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4139,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Empty Mind, Full Pipeline: How Mindfulness Can Help You Sell More","link":"empty-mind-full-pipeline-how-mindfulness-can-help-you-sell-more","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There&rsquo;s been a lot of attention focused on the benefits of mindfulness in business recently. <strong>  Everyone, from HBR to Ariana Huffington, has grasped how being more mindful can help us perform better in the workplace. </strong></p><p> Yet, for some reason, we almost never talk about mindfulness in sales.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve been a long-time believer in the benefits of applying mindfulness and meditation techniques to gain focus, build better relationships and find creative ways to solve problems &ndash; and maximise opportunities.</p><p> And I&rsquo;ve seen the results for myself, time and time again. Improved focus. More deal flow. Better solutions. Higher win rates.</p><h3> <strong>  Why Mindfulness Matters. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Over time, I've come to believe that there is perhaps no area of business where mindfulness is more important&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Why ? Simple. </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Sales is about people. The more we are able to be in the moment, pay full attention to what&rsquo;s happening &ldquo;in the room&rdquo; and focus on others, the better we&rsquo;ll perform.</p><p> If sales is about our ability to connect with others, develop a clear understanding of their needs and objectives, co-develop truly outstanding solutions and building relationships &ndash; then mindfulness lies at the core of all that.</p><p> Any action is pre-determined by intent. Before taking the right action, you need to have the right intent.</p><p> That&rsquo;s the promise that mindfulness in sales holds for sales professionals, and the firms they represent.</p><p> All the sales training in the world isn&rsquo;t going to help if you&rsquo;re sailing through your sales meetings absent-mindedly and controlled by what buddhists call &ldquo;the monkey mind&rdquo;.</p><p> Speaking before you&rsquo;ve thought about what you&rsquo;re going to say. Missing important clues about what&rsquo;s happening at the other side of the table.</p><p> Mindfulness is one of the most simple concepts to understand, but one of the hardest to master. Yet the benefits it holds for sellers (and buyers) are plentiful.</p><h3> <strong>  The Mindful Approach To Sales. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Much of what makes or breaks a sale on a day-to-day basis is focused on what happens in the (increasingly, virtual) room. Active listening. Asking great questions. Rephrasing and paraphrasing. Demonstrating understanding. Building rapport.</p><p> Yet, a lot of what is being taught in classrooms is focused on techniques &ndash; how to &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; someone&rsquo;s gestures, which body language conveys your desire to truly understand someone, etcetera.</p><p> Even though important, those are mostly what I call &ldquo;surface factors&rdquo;. How well you succeed in sales may well depend not on what you do, but what you don't do.</p><p> <strong>  What Is Mindfulness, Anyway ? </strong></p><p> Applying mindfulness in sales is simply the act of staying in the moment, and momentarily pausing or suspending the constant flow of thoughts, emotions, feelings and opinions.</p><p> There&rsquo;s nothing hokey pokey about it, and you don&rsquo;t have to sit cross-legged for hours on end to learn how to do it (even though meditation obviously helps).</p><p> Imagine for a moment really, truly listening to what someone is saying, without judging or thinking about how you&rsquo;ll respond. Imagine hanging on to their every word. Imagine being fully focused on every gesture, every word and every little expression, no matter how tiny.</p><p> Now imagine running every sales meeting like that.</p><p> Do you think you&rsquo;d improve ? Spot things you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t ? Do you think you&rsquo;d pick up on small but important changes in your buyer&rsquo;s tonality, speech and non-verbal behaviour ?</p><p> And do you think those things matter ?</p><p> <strong>  You betcha. </strong></p><p> Even though they are an important part of application, mindfulness in sales is not just about how you behave in sales meetings.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve found it helps me write better. Be more clear in my proposals. Develop better (and more creative) solutions.</p><p> But perhaps the most important benefit of all is this: being mindful keeps me from &ldquo;jumping to conclusions&rdquo; and acting in a &ldquo;shoot first, ask questions later&rdquo; kinda way.</p><p> Staying mindful helps me postpone judgment &ndash; and instead (almost automatically) start asking questions to dig deeper and uncover the real story unfolding.</p><h3> <strong>  In Practice: How To Be More Mindful. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mindfulness isn&rsquo;t just for buddhists anymore. Everyone, from Fortune-500 CEOs to Olympic athletes have discovered its many benefits, and the potential it holds for dramatically improving individual and group performance in virtually every area of business and life.</p><p> If you haven&rsquo;t already, give it a try. Next time you&rsquo;re in a sales call or meeting, try to do the following:</p><li> <strong>  Focus your gaze on just one point at a time </strong> (avoid flittering from point to point, or &ldquo;scanning the room&rdquo;)</li><li> <strong>  Really listen to what is being said &ndash; don&rsquo;t interpret </strong> , judge or try to formulate a response</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t do anything but listen </strong> , (occasionally) speak and take notes</li><li> <strong>  Do one thing at a time </strong> (for example, stop speaking when you&rsquo;re writing and vice versa)</li><li> <strong>  Before responding or speaking, take 1-3 long breaths. </strong> This will not only give you time to formulate a response, but also help you be more clear in your communication</li><li> <strong>  Speak a little slower than you&rsquo;d normally do. </strong> This will help you be better understood, but also make you seem more determined and poised</li><li> <strong>  Perhaps most importantly, really focus your attention on the other person </strong> (instead of yourself). What is being said ? What is NOT being said ? <br/>  </li><p> With all the benefits mindfulness brings to business practice, I&rsquo;m surprised not more has been written about it.</p><p> In &ldquo;Titan: The Life Of John D. Rockefeller Sr&rdquo;, author Ron Cherlow discussed how at least part of Rockefeller&rsquo;s success was his ability to focus on solving just one problem at a time, and dedicating all of his (considerable) mental resources to solving it.</p><p> <strong>  What if we did the same ? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 16:51:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 16:51:03.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_KgMxm94.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/empty-mind-full-pipeline-how-mindfulness-can-help-you-sell-more/\", \"post_id\": \"9040\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 16:51:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 16:51:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"empty-mind-full-pipeline-how-mindfulness-can-help-you-sell-more\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9039\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4298\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Empty-Mind-Full-Pipeline-How-Mindfulness-Can-Help-You-Sell-More.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1258\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454669100,"author_id":6,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4140,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Digging into Fees: How to Unearth Revenue Opportunities","link":"digging-into-fees-how-to-unearth-revenue-opportunities","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIRaefL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Raef Lee  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/enUS/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI  </u> </a></p><p> This article originally appeared on SEI's Practically Speaking Blog.</p><p> In our recent research into advisor fees, one thing stuck out: most advisors spend the same amount of time thinking about the right advisor fee structure for their business as a polar bear thinks about the cost of sunscreen (Editor: maybe an outdated analogy, Raef.). This is mainly due to the Assets Under Management (AUM) model, which is a simplistic catch-all &ndash; simple for the advisor and simple for the client.</p><p> Instead of talking about whether or not to charge an AUM or a retainer fee, let&rsquo;s look at the side issues that can be key revenue generators for advisors &ndash; the ones that can firm up (or detract from) the value proposition you are trying to project.</p><h3> <strong>  3 ways to charge </strong></h3><p> <br/> When advisors congregate, there are usually three main positions on how to charge for financial planning:</p><li> I&rsquo;m an investment advisor and I do not charge for financial planning (I started with the easy one).</li><li> Financial planning is a big part of my value, it is the first thing I do with a client, and so I charge for it (anything from $1,500 to $10,000, depending on the depth of planning).</li><li> Financial planning is a big part of my value, but I do it over time &ndash; so instead of charging for it, I use it to justify my AUM fee. <br/>  </li><p> We polled 775 advisors and asked them if they used an AUM model and charged for financial planning separately &ndash; 26% said yes. This number makes sense to me, because a lot of advisors just focus on investments.</p><p> Like all discussions on how to charge advisor fees, there is no right or wrong answer. But how do you decide? Answering these questions may help you determine what&rsquo;s right for your practice.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Do you have a planning model that is a cyclical and constant part of your service? </strong></h3><p> <br/> A few things to consider with this ongoing planning model:</p><li> It makes sense to use either #3 above, or a newer variation, which is to break out your fees and charge (say, 25BP) for your asset management service and a tiered planning fee (say, $500/month).</li><li> Charging a single AUM fee covering planning is the simplest and easiest model, whereas breaking the fee into two parts is a more direct way of highlighting the services that your clients are paying for.</li><li> With this model, it makes more sense to start transferring assets immediately when you turn a prospect into a client, so the planning is entwined with your asset management advice, forming a single service in the eyes of your client. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  2. Do you do a lot of planning initially and then focus on investments? </strong></h3><p> <br/> This model is dwindling, as financial planning matures into a constant activity. But here are some things to consider with this one-time planning model:</p><li> It makes sense to use the #2 model above, with the obvious rationale that an initial plan is a lot of work and has a great deal of value, and the advisor should be compensated.</li><li> There&rsquo;s a downside to starting your relationship with a new client by asking upfront for a large fee, at a time when you have not yet built trust.</li><li> This model often requires you to do the plan first and then transfer assets to your management. This is a longer process and requires you to have two distinct conversations with your clients: one around the planning fee and one around the AUM fee you charge for asset management. This discounts your ongoing planning advice, which is an inevitable service. <br/>  </li><p> How you do your planning can guide the way you charge. Either way, you should ensure you are compensated for your planning, in a way that you can easily explain to your clients.</p><h3> <strong>  What about small accounts? </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I have minimums!&rdquo; I hear you cry. True, but look through your book and see how many clients fall below your minimums. You will be surprised how many fall below that threshold. The clients in this group are euphemistically called &ldquo;accommodation clients&rdquo; and often include:</p><li> Referrals from your best clients (whom you do not want to upset)</li><li> Family members of your best clients</li><li> Early clients, from those early days when you were not turning any clients away</li><li> Merged clients, from a new advisor in your firm who came with a book of business with a different standard of minimums from yours <br/>  </li><p> In our survey, we found that 74% of advisors do not have a different fee structure for these accounts. That is, you are offering these small account holders the same full service, whilst being paid less, due to their low AUM. Hmmm. Does that sound right?</p><p> One type of intentionally small account clients some firms have focused on are younger with high-income professions (like doctors and lawyers). They have been dubbed HENRYs (High Earning, Not Rich Yet). The idea is that you are putting a deposit on them for when they do build their wealth.</p><p> The real issue with the HENRYs is that they require very different financial advice to your regular clients. They need:</p><li> Guidance around student debt</li><li> Help with multiple life events (first house, first spouse, first baby)</li><li> Help with investing in their careers, such as more education or buying into businesses <br/>  </li><p> Servicing HENRYs often requires one of your advisors, typically a young one, to develop a different set of skills.</p><p> With both accommodation clients and HENRYs, it makes sense to charge a retainer model &ndash; which can vary depending on the services offered &ndash; from $600 to $5,000 per year. The accommodation clients are on the low end; the HENRYs, because of the extra service, are on the high end.</p><p> If a firm wants to try out a retainer-based advisor fee model, this is an excellent way to do so. It can be a step-in to see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, and then be expanded to more of your clients, if it is successful.</p><h3> <strong>  The Assets Under Advisement (AUA) model </strong></h3><p> <br/> Lastly, advisors could hone their fees around AUA (that is, fees on &ldquo;held-away&rdquo; assets). For the majority of potential clients, a big part of their wealth is stored in qualified plans, such as 401(k) or 403(b) accounts. These are assets that advisors cannot put under their management.</p><p> A majority of advisors review clients&rsquo; held-away assets so that they can provide a comprehensive plan. Often, they use aggregation to look at these holdings. Most advisors give advice on these assets within the qualified plans and then the investor executes the transactions on the accounts. Thus, an investor is given a comprehensive financial plan across all of their accounts.</p><p> Aggregation firm ByAllAccounts conducted research in 2015 showing  <u>  <a href=\"http://byallaccounts.morningstar.com/resources/BAABillingonheldawayassets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   45% of advisors charge some fee on AUA accounts  </a> </u> .

Investors can do their own aggregation essentially for free.</p><p> Some advisors have made a complete business around AUA advisor fees, focusing on wealthy investors who have money at multiple institutions. Typically, they not only supply broad positional aggregation (the holdings in the accounts), but also sophisticated performance information across an investor&rsquo;s holdings. This type of investor regards the flexibility of having different accounts in different institutions as key &ndash; and is prepared to pay for it.</p><h3> <strong>  Advisor Fee Research </strong></h3><p> <br/> The information I&rsquo;ve shared here is just one output from our recent research into advisor fees.

In total, the US economy is estimated to spend $800 billion on sales-forces, almost three times the amount spent on advertising.*Not to mention, it's been long-established that compensation is the most important reward used to motivate salespeople.So why do 45% of U.S. companies have workforces that don&rsquo;t understand their compensation plans?** In one survey, only 28% of companies surveyed felt most employees understood the compensation philosophy.***That&rsquo;s no good.But getting a handle on sales force compensation doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult.What if you could motivate your sales reps, reach your organizational goals, and improve performance? That&rsquo;s entirely possible. But you have to see the big picture, not just the pieces of the puzzle.Keep reading to learn what a well-designed sales force compensation plan can do for your company.<h3> <strong>  WHY IS SALES FORCE COMPENSATION ON EVERYBODY'S MIND? </strong></h3>Business leaders have lots of challenges.Chief among them is figuring out the optimal way to compensate their sales forces.&ldquo;What's the ideal compensation incentive plan for our salespeople?&rdquo;&ldquo;How should splits be handled?&rdquo;&ldquo;Should we pay draws?&rdquo;&ldquo;How differently should we design international compensation plans?&rdquo;It&rsquo;s enough to give you a headache just thinking about it. The interesting thing is that all of these nagging questions can be addressed by fine tuning your sales force compensation plan.So, if your current plan doesn't maximize the sales your team is making don&rsquo;t worry. With some insights and a little work you can easily turn things around.Many sales leaders know (on some level) that they can impact their sales strategy with sales compensation. But they're not putting that knowledge to use. They aren't harnessing the power of their sales force compensation plan.For example, some companies don't tie sales compensation to the overall strategic sales plan of their organization. Big mistake.Once you know what to look out for when designing a sales compensation plan, you&rsquo;ll be better equipped to answer the age-old question:&ldquo;What's the ideal compensation incentive plan for our salespeople?&rdquo;The answer is important because if you compensate your salespeople fairly, you'll energize your team. But if you pay too much, you'll end up throwing away money by turning your reps into slackers who can coast along making fewer sales. On the other hand, if you skimp on compensation, you'll push your best salespeople right out the door. So how much is enough, too much or too little? How do you begin to determine the perfect mix of salary, commissions and bonuses to pay your salespeople?We&rsquo;ll get to that soon.In the meantime, know that your sales comp plan is a large cost that should be managed as efficiently as possible. That&rsquo;s why you need compensation plans that work for the company and the sales force.It may be time to examine your sales compensation plan. Here are things the right comp plan can help you accomplish:<li> boost the productivity &amp; performance of your sales force</li><li> attract &amp; retain talented sales reps</li><li> achieve your business objectives by getting the company, sales reps and the sales team on the same page.</li>However, it's not always that simple.<h3> <strong>  SALES FORCE COMPENSATION PLANS CAN BE DAUNTING  </strong></h3>How salespeople are paid has an immense effect on their performance.What&rsquo;s more, your sales force compensation plan is probably the largest single expense item on your P&amp;L statement. In the US, sales force costs average about 10% of sales revenue.It&rsquo;s no surprise that sales compensation is a topic on the mind of business leadership.If you&rsquo;re responsible for crafting a sales compensation plan, you have a lot of choices to make. Setting target pay, selecting the right performance thresholds, establishing quotas, determining the mix and upside opportunity, and constructing the right formula are just a few items you need to consider.But all too often, the issue gets boiled down to &ldquo;All you have to do to keep your sales rock stars and rainmakers motivated is implement the right comp plan.&rdquo;Riiiight. Like it&rsquo;s that easy.So how do you plan sales compensation the right way? Trust me, there is no perfect answer to that question. Before you can successfully design and implement a compensation plan, you have to know a few things.As a rule of thumb, you should start with your revenue goals and objectives and work backward. You should also consider factors like:<li> the company's strategic goals</li><li> the sales strategy</li><li> the type of business and the stage of growth the company is in.</li>For more information on creating a sales compensation plan check out this information from Harvard Business Review on how to compensate and motivate salespeople.<img alt=\"HOWTOCREATEASALESCOMPPLAN\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/464889/HOWTOCREATEASALESCOMPPLAN.png?t=1454584774655\"/>image credit: HBR.orgI strongly believe that most sales compensation plans aren&rsquo;t optimized to get the best results. That&rsquo;s a shame because with a bit of effort companies could improve sales performance by tweaking their sales comp plan.The fact is...<h3> <strong>  A GOOD SALES COMPENSATION PLAN CAN BE YOUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL </strong></h3>\"Whether you're a CEO or a VP of sales, the sales compensation plan is probably the most powerful tool in your tool chest.\" ~<u> Mark Roberge</u>, author of The Sales Acceleration Formula: Using Data, Technology, and Inbound Selling to go from $0 to $100 MillionA well designed compensation plan can be a powerful asset, focusing the sales force, attracting good sales people, and making management's job easier. In fact, the right compensation plan motivates salespeople not only to sell more but to act in ways that support your business' overall strategy. According to Dave Kerpen, Founder &amp; CEO of Likeable Local and NY Times Best-Selling Author &amp; Speaker, \"The sales compensation plan is the most under-appreciated tool in the CEO&rsquo;s toolkit.\"Let these seven tips guide you:<li> <strong>  Focus on driving sales strategy with compensation:  </strong> Your comp plan should incentivize your sales team to achieve the company's goals. When your sales compensation is tied your sales team's ability to reach specific objectives and targets, everyone will be motivated to do the kinds of revenue-driving activities that get results.</li><li> <strong>  Sales compensation should motivate the various sales roles: </strong>  Every sales team has a performance curve. In other words, each sales force is made up of laggards, stars and average sales reps. In most sales organizations, the greatest potential area of improvement lies in motivating the sales reps in the middle of the curve. In any case,  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/07/motivating-salespeople-what-really-works\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research  </a> </u>  suggests that salespeople on the different points of the curve are motivated by different facets of the comp plan. <img alt=\"PERFORMANCECURVEOFREPS\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/464889/PERFORMANCECURVEOFREPS.gif?t=1454584774655\"/> image credit: HBR.org</li><li> <strong>  Don't cap your reps' earnings: </strong>  The desire to cut costs is understandable. But being stingy with sales compensation is bad for business. A recent study on the impact of capping salespeople&rsquo;s pay found when companies stop paying commissions once reps reach a quota ceiling, the salespeople consistently held sales under the ceiling. By eliminating the cap plan, one company in the study increased revenue by 9%.</li><li> <strong>  Be smart with bonuses:  </strong> Studies show that bonuses do increase sales productivity. Data also shows that quarterly bonuses increase productivity more than annual bonuses do. According to Harvard Business School, \"frequent quarterly bonuses tied to high demand end-of-quarter months serve as pacers to keep the sales force on track to achieve their annual sales quotas.\"</li><li> <strong>  Keep it simple: </strong>  For a comp plan to work, your sales force has to understand it. When 45% of U.S. companies have workforces that don&rsquo;t understand their compensation plans, it's clear there is a problem. Communicate with your sales force. Share information on the compensation plan and make sure everyone undrestands exactly what is expected of them.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t forget about communication &amp; implementation:  </strong> It&rsquo;s important to get input form the people affected by the compensation plan. If you're rolling out a new sales comp plan, it is critical that your sales force sales knows what's going on. It's tough to increase sales productivity when your sales team is confused about how they get paid.</li><li> <strong>  Remember that several components in the sales process drive sales effectiveness: </strong>  Compensation is only one piece of an effective sales management system. Don&rsquo;t ignore the other aspects of managing performance and motivating a sales force. It&rsquo;s not just about compensation. Before you tinker with your comp plan make sure your problem isn&rsquo;t something else.</li>Optimizing your sales force compensation plan will help you get better business results whether you are in Sales, Finance or Human Resources.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 17:09:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 17:09:20.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_LI09R8b.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-things-you-should-know-about-sales-force-compensation/\", \"post_id\": \"9044\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 17:09:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 17:09:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-things-you-should-know-about-sales-force-compensation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9043\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4300\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/7-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Sales-Force-Compensation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2060\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454665500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

K. Rowling </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s part of life, part of business, part of any challenging endeavor that we undertake. We&rsquo;ve all experienced it, we&rsquo;ve all survived it, yet we all fear it: failure. Why does the mere thought of it undermine the self-esteem of even the most confident among us? We fear failure because we believe the lies we tell ourselves. Here are four myths that cause us all to fear failing:</p><h3> We will be less than</h3><p> <br/> We often fear that if we fail we will be seen as less than perfect. Well, here&rsquo;s the cold hard truth, none of us are perfect and we never will be. Just because we aren&rsquo;t perfect, doesn&rsquo;t make us any less valuable, less capable, or less worthy.</p><h3> We won&rsquo;t make any progress</h3><p> <br/> We often think that if we are failing, we aren&rsquo;t making any progress. The fact is, quite the opposite is true. There is more to learn from failure than there is from any amount of success. As long as we are learning, we are making progress.</p><h3> It will define us</h3><p> <br/> We often fear that failing makes us a failure. We are not defined by our failures; it&rsquo;s what we do with them that really matters. Failure is an event; it does not speak to who you are, what your values are, or what you are capable of accomplishing.</p><h3> We won&rsquo;t recover</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve failed before and we&lsquo;ll fail again. We recovered last time, we&rsquo;ll recover this time, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet that we&rsquo;ll recover next time. Not to say that recovery isn&rsquo;t a long hard road, but the lessons are in the journey. And the truth is, the more we fail, the better equipped we become to deal with and recover from our next failure.</p><h3> Start Failing</h3><p> <br/> The truth is you&rsquo;re going to fail. You will fail, the person next to you will fail, and the person above you will fail. Failing is an inevitable part of life. But, it is in failing that we find the opportunity to learn, to grow, and to gain confidence. It doesn&rsquo;t make you less than. It will not hinder your progress. It does not define you. And, despite how you may feel at the time, you will recover. It&rsquo;s time to stop believing the myths and start failing.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 17:32:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 17:32:38.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_QUzIm7T.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-myths-that-cause-us-to-fear-failure/\", \"post_id\": \"9046\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 17:32:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 17:32:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-myths-that-cause-us-to-fear-failure\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9045\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4301\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Four-Myths-That-Cause-Us-to-Fear-Failure.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"577\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454691600,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

My first reaction was &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;I was very comfortable in my position as a case agent. By this time, I knew every step in the manual and had my network of informants in place so I could launch an investigation against a foreign intelligence officer with very little effort on my part.</p><p> I felt the quiet pleasure of a smug satisfaction with my existing situation. But in the back of my mind, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t continuing to hone my skills; I wasn&rsquo;t striving to do my best. In truth, I had become complacent; I had reached a plateau.</p><p> When I said &ldquo;NO,&rdquo; I was refusing to take my career to the next level. I was successful as a case agent, but my complacency was not nurturing my ambition. </p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;The tragedy of life is often not in our failure, but rather in our complacency; not in our doing too much, but rather in our doing too little; not in our living above our ability, but rather in our living below our capacities.&rdquo;&mdash;Benjamin E. Mays </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-How-Fulfil-Your-Potential-ebook/dp/B000FCKPHG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422220467&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mindset\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stanford researcher Carol Dweck  </a> </u>  observed, &ldquo;There is no relation between students&rsquo; abilities or intelligence and the development of mastery-oriented qualities. Some of the very brightest students avoid challenges, dislike effort, and wilt in the face of difficulty. And some of the less bright students are real go-getters, thriving on challenge, persisting intensely when things get difficult, and accomplishing more than you expected.&rdquo;</p><p> I had always been a go-getter, but somewhere in those 20 years I had settled into a comfort zone that produced mediocrity.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Complacent strength is our greatest weakness.&ldquo;&mdash;LaRae Quy </strong></p><p> I eventually did say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and represented the FBI for 4 years in Northern California. I&rsquo;m going to share 5 effective ways that I took it to the next level, and so can you:</p><h3> <strong>  1. ADMIT YOU HAVE HIT A PLATEAU </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t take it to the next level until you admit you&rsquo;re looking at a long stretch in the way of where you want to go. </p><p> As hard as you look, it appears to go on forever. If you ever do find the end, you may be greeted with a sharp precipice plunging downward&mdash;or a steep incline reaching upward.</p><h3> <strong>  2. INSPECT YOUR FOUNDATION </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t take it to the next level until you take a closer look at why you&rsquo;re doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> <strong>  Often, we get into something only because a teacher or parent told us we should. Finding ourselves stuck on an endless plateau may be a pinprick to our heart that we&rsquo;ve taken the wrong road. </strong></p><p> A plateau can be the way your body and mind gets your attention if you are pursuing a career or goal that does not hold value and meaning for you. Flat terrain may provide you an opportunity to reassess the direction your life is going to decide whether this is where you really want to be.</p><h3> <strong>  3. DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PLATEAU AND BURNOUT </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t take it to the next level until you know whether you&rsquo;re experiencing a plateau&mdash;or a burnout.</p><p> In a plateau, you can find ways to become empowered and recharged. Burnout is trying to do the same old things, or do things in the same old ways, without recognizing your need for reassessment.</p><li> The cure for a plateau is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm will propel you to learn new skills and information to keep moving forward.</li><li> The cure for burnout is excavating the resentment you feel for what you&rsquo;ve had to sacrifice in order to get where you are. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. RECOGNIZE SURVIVAL MODE FOR WHAT IT IS&mdash;MEDIOCRITY </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t take it to the next level until you can sift out the junk that&rsquo;s taking up so much of your time and energy.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re so tired and frustrated that you feel you&rsquo;re just in survival mode, change is one more item on your list to deal with! So why not stay in the plateau? Better the devil you know than the one you don&rsquo;t&mdash;right?</p><p> Mediocrity is settling for less than you know you can be, whether in business or life. It&rsquo;s giving up on finding a path that will bring greater happiness and joy.</p><h3> <strong>  5. DEVELOP A GROWTH MINDSET </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t take it to the next level until you make learning new skills and qualities a priority in your life.</p><p> Carol Dweck discovered through her research that our mindset affects our ability to fulfill our potential&mdash;to grow and learn, take risks, bounce back from adversity, to build healthy relationships.   </p><p> <strong>  If we have a &ldquo;fixed mindset,&rdquo; we believe our qualities, including our intelligence, are something we were born with and cannot be changed.

But, if there is another advisor in that office who is an Engager &amp; fluent in Javanese, they will likely have an easier time matching their natural behaviors to each other. We know this matrix does not create a bromance like Chewy &amp; Han Solo.

Each one is doing whatever he thinks he should and views the other as the problem when things don&rsquo;t seem to work.</p><p> It is mind boggling to hear the difference in the picture each described of where they were and where they were going. As they worked separately without consulting each other, the space between their individual perceptions was widening.</p><p> Facilitating the difficult conversation between them where I taught them to actually listen to each other they were amazed that they were having a conversation and not yelling.</p><p> That brought them to the realization that their basic original desires and dreams for this business were still the same and they actually still liked each other.

If the client doesn&rsquo;t have such a guide, we can help them create one. In this post we&rsquo;ll focus on the style guide for copy.</p><p> This guide is useful not only for writers in the marketing department, but also for the web team, client relations, media relations, the sales team and more &ndash; basically anyone who writes marketing materials, web copy, letters, emails and other types of content.</p><p> <strong>  A style guide is useful not only for writers in the marketing department, but also for the web team, client relations, media relations, the sales team and more. </strong></p><h3> How to get started</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a great exercise for writers and editors to create a style guide. The team should determine the key aspects of style to document. What mistakes or style missteps do they often see? What style questions do others frequently ask them? Seek input from colleagues across the company. If desired, look through marketing materials, email messages, advertising and web copy for inspiration.</p><p> Style guides can be simple or comprehensive. Some are a single page and others run 30 pages or more. Consider including some or all of the following in your style guide:</p><li> <strong>  Common grammar rules </strong></li><li> <strong>  Preferred spelling of words and terms </strong></li><li> <strong>  Frequently misused words and terms </strong></li><li> <strong>  Correct &ndash; and full &ndash; spelling of fund/product names, index names, etc. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Glossary of common terms, defined </strong></li><li> <strong>  Explanation of industry-related acronyms and abbreviations </strong></li><li> <strong>  Best practices of style &ndash; examples include address format, font preferences, how to express numbers, style of bulleted lists, Canadian vs. U.S. spelling, active vs. passive voice, how to footnote </strong></li><li> <strong>  How to write a letter or email (e.g., salutation, body copy construction, call to action, signature line) </strong> <br/>  </li><p> A robust style guide helps ensure brand consistency. The guide is a fluid document that should be updated when rules, preferences and other circumstances change. If yours is printed, consider updating it every year. A digital guide is easier to update as the need arises but, regardless of format, your company will be well served by a current, accurate style guide.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 18:11:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 18:11:29.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_goTV8xb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/strengthen-your-brand-with-a-style-guide/\", \"post_id\": \"9053\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 18:11:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 18:11:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"strengthen-your-brand-with-a-style-guide\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9052\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4305\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Strengthen-Your-Brand-With-a-Style-Guide.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"494\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454695200,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4147,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Head-On Collision: How to Actually Win a Good Fight","link":"head-on-collision-how-to-actually-win-a-good-fight","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/asytner/\" target=\"_blank\">   Ari Sytner  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.asytner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   arisytner.com  </u> </a> Newton famously said that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Yes, this applies to relationships, and the way people&rsquo;s words and hostilities collide when fighting.</p><h3> When a couple fights, think of it as two freight trains racing toward one another.</h3>The stronger and faster they go, the more disastrous the impact will be. Plus, in all likelihood, at least one, if not both trains, will be severely damaged and even totally destroyed.Therefore, in order to win a fight, the goal is to avoid a collision altogether by reducing the speed, intensity, and even changing the complete direction of the conversation.Wait a second! What if you feel that you are absolutely right and you deserve to win the fight? Why should you not hold your ground and stick to your principles?I want you to always remember this point: if someone wins, that means that the other person loses. If they lose, two things will happen.<li> The relationships as a whole will suffer because your partner is defeated</li><li> You are now stuck with a loser (and nobody wants to be in a relationship with a loser!)</li><strong> Therefore, we must keep in mind that the goal of an argument is not to win the fight! Rather, it is simply to avoid a collision by changing tracks and resuming the journey, while heading blissfully together in the same direction.</strong><h3> So, how does this work? How does one simply change tracks?</h3>Please indulge me further in my train analogy: For those who have ridden the subway, you know the feeling of watching a train fly by you in the opposite direction. As you look out the window, all you see is a blur of faces and streaks of colors. There is absolutely no connection to the people in the next train.However, from time to time, a train pulls up alongside yours, heading in the same direction and at the same speed. It is during those moments when you look outside and instead of feeling the rush of motion, it is as if everything stands still and you can clearly see all the faces of the strangers in the next train. You can smile, wave and feel a real connection, almost as if they are in the same train with you.<h3> This paradigm is exactly how we fight.</h3>Take a husband and wife for example - angry, frustrated and armed with a laundry list of reasons why they each think they are right. Ultimately, like two trains, they will either violently collide, or just fly past the other in a blur and squander the opportunity to truly connect.What if there was a way for the two trains to pull up alongside each other and move in the same direction so that they can once again connect and see one another, rather than only see a blur?This is a common exercise that I do with my clients. I invite them to look at the other person&rsquo;s point of view, digest it, and really try to see it through their own eyes. This is not only an intellectual exercise but an emotional one as well.Instead of asking, &ldquo;why is my wife so stubborn?&rdquo;, try this: &ldquo;I wonder why this issue is so important to her?&rdquo;Instead of asking, &ldquo;why does my husband always think he is right?&rdquo;, try this: &ldquo;I wonder what I could be doing better to show him that I value his opinion and feelings&rdquo;.Thus, even if you don&rsquo;t agree, perhaps you can stop and appreciate who they are and why they feel the way they do. Slowing down to appreciate the person more than the agenda, is what we talk about when we say that relationships take hard work and compromise.<h3> Whenever we stick to our guns and hold our ground, nobody wins.</h3>What we ultimately want to do is each abandon our own rigid views, in place of a suitable compromise that shows we care more about the person than our perspective. After all, you must ask yourself, do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 18:20:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 18:20:32.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_HAsS5WW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/head-on-collision-how-to-actually-win-a-good-fight/\", \"post_id\": \"9055\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 18:20:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 18:20:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"head-on-collision-how-to-actually-win-a-good-fight\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9054\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4306\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Head-On-Collision-How-to-Actually-Win-a-Good-Fight.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"644\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454702400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Do I follow the rules or break them? Am I living in fear or acting in courage? <br/> <br/> In Falling Upward, Richard Rohr wrote that the dualistic mind compares, competes, conflicts, conspires, condemns, cancels out contrary evidence, and crucifies with impunity. With comparison comes judgment and condemnation naturally follows. Dualistic thinking leads to a decision that one thing is good and the other is bad. Rather than seeing the whole picture, we see only a part of the story - that which affirms our view of the world and the story we have told. Forcing discrete choices with dualistic thinking is not helpful in most of life&rsquo;s situations and may create turmoil in our relationships.  <br/> <br/> Non-dualistic thinking, on the other hand, involves wholeness. We move away from either-or in favor of both-and. </p><li> <strong>  Sometimes I get energy by interacting with other people and other times a burst of energy follows a day of seclusion. </strong></li><li> <strong>  I want to be successful at work and satisfied with my home life. </strong></li><li> <strong>  I need to focus on my own self-care needs and give unselfishly to others.  </strong></li><li> <strong>  Sometimes &ldquo;rules&rdquo; must be followed and sometimes they can be broken. </strong></li><li> <strong>  And often times, I am terrified and I still find the courage to act. </strong></li><h3> <br/> Non-duality is incredibly important when we are in times of change or deep personal growth.</h3><p> <br/> Real, lasting behavior change takes time; it does not happen overnight or over the course of a few weeks. When we get trapped into non-dualistic thinking, we see ourselves only as passing or failing, changing or not changing. In reality, sometimes we are going to be the person we want to be and act the way we want to act, and other times, we are not. We&rsquo;re going to slip. We&rsquo;re going to take two or ten steps backward. We are going to make mistakes.  <br/> <br/> But failing does not make us a failure. We are imperfect human beings, who throughout the day are subjected to any number of external situations and environmental issues that impact our behavior and the choices we make. As we learn to practice present moment awareness, we&rsquo;ll notice more quickly when we are getting off track so we can try again. Rather than scoring ourselves pass or fail, we see that we are doing the best we can given the situation and grade ourselves an &ldquo;A&rdquo; for our best effort. </p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 18:25:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 18:25:04.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_mq3F0et.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/non-dualistic-thinking/\", \"post_id\": \"9057\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 18:25:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 18:25:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"non-dualistic-thinking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9056\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4307\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Non-Dualistic-Thinking.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"905\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454698800,"author_id":468,"chart_url":""}

Michael Armstrong purportedly described as follows:</p><p> &ldquo;The ancient Romans had a tradition: whenever one of their engineers constructed an arch, as the capstone was hoisted into place, the engineer assumed accountability for his work in the most profound way possible: he stood under the arch.&rdquo;</p><p> While I am not sure there is an actual historical record that supports this, Chairman Armstrong&rsquo;s assertion evokes images of trembling architects awaiting the ultimate proof of their competency. It also has a morbid Darwinian flair whereby only the best architects survived.</p><p> While far less harsh, the world of customer experience performance management has certainly taken a turn in the direction of increased accountability!</p><p> Healthcare, for example, used to operate somewhat like the lead character from the long-running television series &ldquo;House.&rdquo; That character, Dr. Gregory House, played by Hugh Laurie, offered negative and, at times, awful patient experiences while delivering his product &ndash; extraordinary diagnostic skills and amazing clinical outcomes. In recent years, value-based purchasing in healthcare has linked reimbursement levels for providers with the ratings about how patients feel they are treated. The Dr. House&rsquo;s of the world are less tolerated in healthcare today!</p><h3> So let&rsquo;s assume you want to drive increased customer accountability in your business. Where do you start?</h3><p> <br/> Let me offer some insights born from my work with leaders at Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA). In my recent book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.driventodelight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Driven to Delight: Delivering World-Class Customer Experience the Mercedes-Benz Way  </a> </u> , I detail how Mercedes-Benz developed tools for acquiring customer feedback and how they used that feedback to compensate dealers, based on the way customers felt they were treated at a given dealership. In lieu of the in-depth exploration provided in the book, I thought it might be helpful to simply offer the &ldquo;must have&rdquo; ingredients for effective customer experience accountability:</p><li> <strong>  Map your customer journey and identify the important contact points from your customers&rsquo; perspective. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Identify the optimal times and methods to solicit feedback from your customers. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Ask your customers about their satisfaction with how your team served them at those important contact points. Also inquire about your customers&rsquo; perception of their relationship with your people and brand (e.g. net promoter score, customer effort assessment, and likelihood to repurchase). </strong></li><li> <strong>  Look for correlations between the input of your customers and your key performance indicators. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Extrapolate real-time data from the customer feedback which drives KPI&rsquo;s (e.g. a Customer Experience Index) and present it in a dashboard that is easily understood and actionable by your team. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Respond quickly to individual customer needs and look for trends that suggest areas where processes must be improved. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Set up a compensation/reward/recognition program for high performers on important customer experience metrics. Offer development tools for those who can improve their experience delivery. Encourage team members to explore other career opportunities or other employers if they consistently &ldquo;don&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t&rdquo; delight your customers. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Share &ldquo;wow&rdquo; stories and customer service breakdown stories throughout your organization to personalize the customer feedback you receive. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  If you execute on these 8 steps (not that I am saying they are easy), I suspect you won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;trembling&rdquo; under the weight of customer perceptions. </strong> Rather you will be the brand that people call &ldquo;world-class&rdquo; and be a company that I will be talking about from a keynote stage for audiences around the world!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 18:32:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 18:32:58.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_oBuzEAm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/trembling-being-accountable-to-the-customer/\", \"post_id\": \"9059\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 18:32:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 18:32:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"trembling-being-accountable-to-the-customer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9058\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4308\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trembling-Being-Accountable-to-the-Customer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"691\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454674500,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

This contrasts to last year, when Australian marketers said engagement (87%) and brand awareness (85%) were their top goals.</p><p> At the same time, 55% of marketers cited measurement as one of their top challenges, specifically measuring the ROI of their content marketing program and measuring content effectiveness.</p><p> So how do you determine whether your content is kicking its goals and which metrics you should measure? Here are our top three tips for measurement in content marketing for financial services.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Map content goals to business objectives </strong></h3><p> <br/> Is your goal to generate leads? Raise awareness? Both? Before drawing up your content marketing strategy, it&rsquo;s imperative to know what your underlying business objectives are and align your content accordingly.</p><p> As tempting as it is to keep goals &lsquo;woolly&rsquo;, ultimately this is a trap. The  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u>  found that 61% of the most effective Australian marketers have a documented editorial mission statement in place. So, careful thinking and planning that links your content goals back to your business objectives is key.</p><p> These are what your content marketing goals could be depending on what your business objectives are:</p><p> <img alt=\"table-1.png\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/table-1.png?t=1454559778568&amp;width=739&amp;height=128\"/></p><p> Once you have a clear idea of your content marketing goals, only then will you be able to set clear KPIs for your content strategy and determine what tools you need to measure impact</p><h3> <strong>  2. Measure ROI </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whether it&rsquo;s Return on Investment, Return on Objective, or both, you need to introduce robust, coherent measurement systems that can demonstrate your content marketing strategy is delivering as intended. Some great tools for this are  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google Analytics  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HubSpot  </a> </u> , which we&rsquo;re big fans of.</p><p> Google Analytics is a free web analytics service that tracks and reports website traffic and can help turn insights into action. You can use this to set goals for your content, which can include anything from site views to sales and lead generation.</p><p> HubSpot, on the other hand, is a paid inbound marketing software platform that helps companies attract visitors, convert those visitors into leads, and ultimately close them as customers. HubSpot provides oversight over all of a prospect&rsquo;s touchpoints with your content, so you can attribute new leads and sales directly to content pieces such as blog posts or your latest eBook.</p><p> An accurate measure of ROI involves calculating the lifetime value and therefore the profit margin of a customer, then comparing this value to the average cost of your content marketing efforts per customer acquisition. This method can be applied to each program, then rolled up to overall content marketing ROI. An important thing to note when calculating cost per acquisition is to take into account the actual cost of production of the content in terms of time, in addition to any external production or promotion costs.</p><p> A simpler, albeit less precise, calculation of ROI would be to use the correlation method, i.e. measuring an increase of revenue as correlated with an increase in content consumption and sharing metrics.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2016_Aus_Research_11.16.15_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute&rsquo;s 2016 Benchmark, Budgets and Trends  </a> </u>  report found that nearly all Australian marketers (91%) rated &lsquo;sales lead quality&rsquo; as an important metric for their organisation, as opposed to website traffic.</p><p> So, think about the type of people you want to attract to your business, how you can tailor your content to draw them in, and how you can keep them interested. High web traffic is great, but if you aren&rsquo;t capturing the people you really want as leads, is it doing anything to help your bottom line.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Quality vs quantity </strong></h3><p> <br/> Although the bottom-line numbers are critical, don&rsquo;t simply weigh up your content marketing results in &lsquo;hard&rsquo; monetary terms. You should also rely on other qualitative metrics such as who is downloading and subscribing to your content and how much time they are spending reading the content on your website. A good metric to determine engaged visitors is the percentage of readers who dwelled longer than thirty seconds, out of total unique visits.</p><p> Analyse your customer behaviour carefully. Find out what content and which delivery channels are more effective with different client segments and recalibrate your content accordingly to ensure you&rsquo;re bringing in the people you really want. Having fewer but higher quality leads will be more effective in the long term because they&rsquo;re likely to refer like-minded people to you if you nurture them properly.</p><p> When it comes to content marketing for financial services, measurement is a fundamental part of the process, critical to proving value and creating better results. The only way to understand what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not is to set clear goals and track and analyse key metrics. If your content factory isn&rsquo;t underpinned by robust analytics, it will be impossible to make improvements and deliver success.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-04 22:31:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-04 22:31:45.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_zfKhI9m.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/target-review-refine-repeat-content-marketing-goals-and-metrics/\", \"post_id\": \"9063\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-04 22:31:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-04 22:31:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"target-review-refine-repeat-content-marketing-goals-and-metrics\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9062\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4310\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Target-Review-Refine-Repeat-Content-Marketing-Goals-and-Metrics.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"814\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454709600,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

The general meme is that the current regime of ultra-low interest rates just cannot last, and that the great bond bull market that began in the early 1980s will end any time now. In <u> <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/04/22/100-of-economists-think-yields-will-rise-within-six-months/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  April 2014 </a></u>, 100% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to rise in the following six months &ndash; rates fell instead. This inability to accurately forecast long term rates, even across a short horizon, is not new. As a recent <u> report</u> from the White House Council of Economic Advisors discusses, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), financial markets and professional forecasters have consistently failed to predict the secular fall in nominal interest rates, focusing too much on cyclical factors.<a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/economist-10-year-yield-forecasts.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"economist 10-year yield forecasts\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/economist-10-year-yield-forecasts.png\"/></a><u> Source</u>: White House Council of Economic AdvisorsAs we mentioned at the top, one can make a case that recent central bank policy is responsible for plunging yields across the developed world, but it still does not explain the secular decline over the past couple of decades. At the same time the argument is not quite as straightforward when you consider the United States, where central bank policy is rapidly diverging from other central banks around the developed world. The Federal Reserve is clearly confident that the economy has picked up enough steam so as to withstand the end of quantitative easing (October 2014) and liftoff from zero interest rates (December 2015). However, the yield curve has flattened significantly over the past two years.<a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yield-curve-20131231-20160131.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"yield curve 20131231-20160131\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yield-curve-20131231-20160131.png\"/></a><u> <a href=\"http://treasury.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">  Source: Treasury.gov </a></u>It stands to reason that if the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy, as they did in December 2015, rates at the short end of the yield curve should go up (which we see above). The 2-year yield should essentially reflect what the market thinks 1-3-month rates will be two years from now. The 2-year yield ended 2015 at 1.06 percent, almost 40 basis points higher than where it began the year. The 1-year yield also finished 2015 about 40 basis points higher than where it started, rising to 0.65 percent.At the same time, the 10-year yield rose only 10 basis points in 2015, to 2.27 percent &ndash; at the end of 2013, the 10-year yield was 3.04 percent.Note that a flattening of the yield curve by itself is not indicative of future recession (unlike an inverted yield curve). Throughout the late &rsquo;90s, when the economy was expanding at a rapid pace, the yield curve was much flatter than what it is today.<a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yield-curve-19980630-20160131.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"yield curve 19980630-20160131\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/yield-curve-19980630-20160131.png\"/></a><u> <a href=\"http://treasury.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">  Source: Treasury.gov </a></u>So what gives? Shouldn&rsquo;t interest rates further out along the yield curve also move higher as the Fed raises rates along the short end (which they directly control)?<h3> <strong>  Lower expected inflation </strong></h3>As Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, <u> <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/04/13-interest-rate-term-premiums\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  explained </a></u> last year, the yield on a long-term bond can be broken into three components:<li> Expected path of future short-term rates</li><li> A term premium</li><li> Expected inflation</li>At this time, all three factors are keeping interest rates low. Even though the Fed appears to have embarked on a tightening path, nobody believes they can get to their official 2007 forecast of a 5.25 target rate. The current median long-run <u> <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20151216.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  forecast </a></u> for the short-term target rate stands at 3.50, and that assumes their forecast of long-run GDP growth of 1.8-2% pans out without an interim slowdown/recession.The term premium is the extra return that investors demand of a long-term bond over a series of short-term securities. It is bit of an esoteric concept, not least because they cannot be directly observed but must be estimated from short and long-term interest rates using a model. Usually, the term premium tends to be positive since investors want extra compensation for holding a long-term bond. It is also generally expected to rise as macro-economic policies, both fiscal and monetary, normalize. Nevertheless, calculations from economists at the New York Fed indicate that the term premium has also been in <u> <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/data_indicators/term_premia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  secular decline </a></u> since the 1980s. It has been hovering around zero lately, even falling below it at times.The perceived risk of holding long-term bonds greatly influences the term premium, and the biggest risk to holding a long-term bond is obviously an unexpected rise in inflation, which is tied to the third point mentioned above. Bernanke writes that since the 1980s, inflation and inflation fears have receded steadily, and bondholders have accordingly been willing to accept less compensation for bearing inflation risk.Expected inflation in the future is clearly impacted by future economic growth, and over the long-run that is dependent on productivity growth and population growth. However, commentators who have been predicting higher interest rates have clearly under-estimated the effect of slowing productivity and changing demographics.<h3> <strong>  Slowing Productivity </strong></h3>When you have strong economic growth, there is typically a lot of competition for investment dollars &ndash; for example, to build more factories, roads, houses and other tools to help business grow &ndash; and interest rates rise. Yet if economic growth is expected to slow (or reverse), there is not a lot of incentive to invest since the existing inventory should be able to serve current needs. Under that scenario, parking money in less risky assets like treasuries makes more sense and interest rates fall.Productivity growth across the developed world has been <u> <a href=\"/category/learn/global\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  slowing </a></u> recently and this is expected to continue according to <u> <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/OECD-2015-The-future-of-productivity-book.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  OECD </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15116.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  IMF </a></u> forecasts. Just in the U.S., <u> <a href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=252534&amp;category_id=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  productivity growth </a></u> has been falling since the beginning of the last decade and is currently growing at less than 1% annually. Back in the 1990s, there was more capital spending and we got a lot of technological tools to improve productivity, but spending has fallen considerably since then.Robert J. Gordon, a distinguished macro-economist and economic historian at Northwestern University, has <u> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/books/review/the-powers-that-were.html\" target=\"_blank\">  argued </a></u> that recent developments in I.T. do not measure up to past achievements that powered economic growth between 1870 and 1970, namely: electricity, urban sanitation, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the internal combustion engine and modern communication. In his new <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  book </a></u> &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of American Growth&rdquo;, Gordon points out that genuinely major innovations typically affect business practices in a major way. While the late-1990s and early-2000s saw some changes along these lines thanks to progress in I.T., there has not been much since.The direction and impact of future innovation remains unclear but interest rates will continue to remain at lower levels if productivity growth continues along its recent trend.<h3> <strong>  Demographic shifts </strong></h3>Although it is difficult to ascertain future technological progress and predict economic growth, it is reasonably clear that a demographic shift is taking place, especially in the developed world &ndash; with aging populations and slower labor-force growth.Why is slower population growth a concern? As this article from <u> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/12/15/10232654/low-interest-rates-permanent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  vox.com </a></u> points out, if a country&rsquo;s population stops growing, there is little point in building out new houses, offices or other infrastructure. While there will still be a need for servicing existing facilities, the total amount of investment spending will fall, which in turn puts downward pressure on interest rates. Recent academic <u> <a href=\"http://www.novasbe.unl.pt/images/novasbe/files/file_10661_2_1338544398.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  work </a></u> has indicated that demographic shifts can indeed push interest rates lower.Perhaps the best example of this is Japan, which has seen its population decline and experienced low economic growth and falling interest rates for more than two decades now. The country&rsquo;s low fertility rate of <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> 1.43</a> (total number of live births per 1,000 women of reproductive age in a population per year, and a good indicator of population growth) is among the lowest in the world. This also means that the population is aging. Japan has a very low unemployment rate and higher labor-force participation than the U.S., but essentially, the problem is that the country is running out of people to help keep the economy growing.In the following chart, we plot fertility rates  across thirty-one OECD countries against the yield on their respective 10-year bonds (as of Dec 31st, 2015). Israel and Greece were removed as outliers due to idiosyncratic reasons behind the former&rsquo;s high birth-rate and the latter&rsquo;s high interest rates.<a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fertility-rate-vs-10-year-yield.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"fertility rate vs 10-year yield\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fertility-rate-vs-10-year-yield.png\"/></a>Source: <u> <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  World Bank </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/world-government-bonds\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  investing.com </a></u>.The rising regression line shows that fertility rates and long-term interest rates are positively related &ndash; countries with higher fertility rates generally have higher interest rates, and vice versa. The R-squared term of 0.21 indicates that fertility rate explains 21% of the variation in 10-year bond yields across these countries.The U.S. is among the few nations that has a fertility rate high enough to sustain population growth, and economic growth over the long-run. In turn, the 10-year yield in the U.S. is higher than most of its developed world counterparts. Similar to Japan, Germany is another example of a nation that has a low fertility rate (~ 1.41) that is insufficient to support population growth, and accompanied by depressed ten-year yields (sitting below 0.30 percent as of this writing).<h3> <strong>  Risk-off events </strong></h3>Anyone in the financial industry, not to mention those who happened to glance across newspaper front pages during the last decade, cannot have failed to see the recurrence of global upheavals that have investors rushing toward safe, liquid assets.Tail-risk events &ndash; including events surrounding the financial crisis, the Greece debt crisis, Russia-Ukraine, political upheavals in the Middle-East and more recently China&rsquo;s economic struggles &ndash; seem to be happening with more regularity. As Bernanke <u> <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/04/13-interest-rate-term-premiums\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  notes </a></u>, treasury bonds offer an unparalleled combination of liquidity and safety during these episodes. They are also the asset of choice for foreign governments that want to hold large quantities of foreign exchange reserves. Consequently the yield on these bonds, and the term premium, is pushed down further.<h3> <strong>  What is a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; interest rate? </strong></h3>As we discussed at the top, commentators in the finance industry have been predicting higher rates ever since the end of the great recession and the customary thinking is that rates should snap back to their &lsquo;normal&rsquo; pre-recession levels (when U.S. 10-year yields exceeded 4.50). At the same time, as the economist Neil Irwin <u> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/upshot/why-very-low-interest-rates-may-stick-around.html?ref=topics&amp;_r=4\" target=\"_blank\">  writes </a></u>:<strong> &ldquo;&hellip; if you look at the longer arc of history, a much different possibility emerges. Investors have often talked about the global economy since the crisis as reflecting a &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; of slow growth and low inflation. But, just maybe, we have really returned to the old normal.</strong><strong> Very low rates have often persisted for decades upon decades, pretty much whenever inflation is quiescent, as it is now. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note was below 4 percent every year from 1876 to 1919, then again from 1924 to 1958. The record is even clearer in Britain, where long-term rates were under 4 percent for nearly a century straight, from 1820 until the onset of World War I.</strong><p> <strong>  The real aberration looks like the 7.3 percent average experienced in the United States from 1970 to 2007.&rdquo; </strong></p>The following chart shows interest rates between 1871 and 2015. The average over the entire period is 4.6 percent but the average between 1871 and 1970 is only 3.65 percent.<a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/historical-us-10-year-yield.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"historical us 10-year yield\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/historical-us-10-year-yield.png\"/></a><u> <a href=\"http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Source </a></u>: Dr. Robert Shiller&rsquo;s online dataOur analysis here is not to say that interest rates will continue to decline over the next week, month or year but that there are broad, long-term forces acting to push them lower than we have seen in recent decades. We also see from the above data that low rates rates have persisted for long periods in the past.A lot of commentary on interest rates tend to focus on transitory factors like macro-economic policy, while ignoring longer-term structural factors like slowing productivity and demographic changes as well as the impact of recurring risk-off events. While the Federal Reserve and other central banks clearly have the ability to control short-term interest rates, this is not quite the case as far as long-term rates are concerned. Long-term interest rates are perhaps most dependent on the long-term inflation outlook, and the factors that normally boost inflationary pressure over the long-term seem to have all but dissipated.Akin to free-body diagrams in physics, which show the direction and magnitude of forces acting on an object in a certain situation, the following picture summarizes the forces currently acting to push interest rates up or down.<a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/forces-on-long-term-interest-rates.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"forces on long-term interest rates\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/forces-on-long-term-interest-rates.png\"/></a><h3> <strong>  So our answer to the title question &lsquo;Are higher interest rates inevitable?&rsquo; would simply have to be no. </strong></h3>Naturally, low interest rates in the foreseeable future has drastic ramifications for a growing older population that is dependent on income for their expenses.

I love being inspired by new thought.</h3><p> <br/> And once in a while, someone utters something that puts all this new book-wisdom to shame.  Someone delivers the back-to-basics message.</p><p> Mitch, a CEO with a resounding success record of turning troubled companies around, addresses a group of mid-career professionals. His audience expects to hear insights on strategy, tips on execution, wisdom on how to build great teams. Here&rsquo;s what they get from Mitch:</p><li> Be genuine</li><li> Care about people <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  You may go DUH. Of course. I know that. </strong></p><p> Good. These are the basics Dale Carnegie so compellingly wrote about in his 1936 classic &ldquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&rdquo; Back to the future. You can&rsquo;t fake the basics with technology. You can&rsquo;t fake them with charm. You can&rsquo;t. And without these two basics, your personal impact in the world is forever diminished. Lasting impact is impossible.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s break down these two items, shall we? <br/>  </h3><li> Be genuine <br/>  </li><p> We have created lots of code language around this notion. Be vulnerable, be transparent. Yeah, I like those words. If we&rsquo;re going to go modern, I like be real best. Genuine has a more old-fashioned ring to it that I like even better. Allow me to translate: Don&rsquo;t bullshit people. Don&rsquo;t deliver fake-peppy talk. Don&rsquo;t unload unexamined clich&eacute;s on folks. Don&rsquo;t pretend to have answers that you don&rsquo;t have. Don&rsquo;t act like you have it all together when you don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t hold me or anyone else to an idealized standard that no one can meet.</p><h3> Have good boundaries. But be real. Be human. Be genuine. <br/>  </h3><li> Care about people <br/>  </li><p> It doesn&rsquo;t mean act nice. Doesn&rsquo;t mean showering folks with gifts or compliments. Doesn&rsquo;t mean discussing career planning or expressing interest in someone&rsquo;s personal life. It may, in fact, mean firmly holding someone accountable and offering a bit of tough love. On the most essential level, caring about people springs from an unwavering belief that in the larger scheme of things, you and the other person are one. Regardless of position, of education, or social standing, there is no separation or separateness between you two. Act from that place. It is the well from which true caring springs.</p><h3> Please have boundaries. Do not be separate from others. <br/>  </h3><p> I believe in fake it til you make it &ndash; when it comes to confidence, when it comes to tackling that which you have not yet mastered. You can&rsquo;t, however, fake the people stuff. It doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> Drop fully into being genuine and caring about people. If you already embody these qualities, you know how they help you meet every challenge with grace. If you have a sense that you can drop a little deeper, go ahead, make the drop.</p><p> And if you were to hop into a dinghy and head for a desert island where internet distractions are not to be found, take Dale Carnegie with you.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-06 23:51:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-06 23:51:34.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_wWlXjGz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-two-things-you-cant-fake/\", \"post_id\": \"9073\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-06 23:51:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-06 23:51:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-two-things-you-cant-fake\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9072\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4316\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Two-Things-You-Can\\u2019t-Fake.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"817\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454929200,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4157,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Death and Family Security","link":"death-and-family-security","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/ultimate-unplanned-business-exit-death\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first article  </a> </u>  in this series, we met Ralph, an owner who died with an up-to-date estate plan, but absolutely no coordination between that plan and his business Exit Plan. After Ralph died, his business failed, and his estate was bankrupted. We recommended that Exit Planning Advisors ask owners&mdash;and see that they answer&mdash;four questions, the first of which is:</p><h3> If I die tomorrow, can my family maintain the lifestyle I want for them?</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s assume for a moment that one of your owner/clients exits&mdash;during lifetime or at death&mdash;receives, in cash, the full fair market value of his or her ownership interest. When that happens, will the owner&rsquo;s family (and owner, if he or she is still around) be able to continue to enjoy its current lifestyle?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s further assume that your client&rsquo;s ownership interest is subject to a current, fully funded buy-sell agreement.</p><li> It requires that, should an owner die, there will be a mandatory sale of a deceased owner&rsquo;s interest at full fair market value.</li><li> The purchase price is fully funded with life insurance. <br/>  </li><p> The thinking goes as follows: Should a co-owner die, the mandatory sale makes the decedent&rsquo;s family whole; in fact better than whole because we have replaced a closely-owned business interest (an illiquid asset) with cash. What more can an owner want?</p><h3> <strong>  But Wait: There&rsquo;s More! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Owners generally want to continue their current standard of living after they exit, and will not exit if it means living on less income. To generate the desired amount of post-exit income owners must substantially grow business value and cash flow. If owners don&rsquo;t survive until their exits, there is usually not enough business value to maintain their desired and existing lifestyle. This is true even if their buy-sell agreements are fully funded and use formulas that properly value their businesses.</p><h3> <strong>  The Nub of It All </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is a second consideration: Even a fully funded buy-sell agreement that pays a decedent owner&rsquo;s family full value for his or her ownership interest does not provide enough investment capital to replace more than a fraction of the owner&rsquo;s current income, not to mention the extra cash flow normally retained in the business or invested in other assets. Blame the Headwinds <a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/death-and-family-security#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a>  and the increased disparity between the valuation of closely-held businesses (usually an EBITDA multiple of between three and five) and low-risk investments (U.S. ten-year Treasury bonds currently yielding 2%).</p><p> I&rsquo;ll use Jack (a fictional client) to illustrate the problem of dying in return for &ldquo;only&rdquo; fair market value for an ownership interest.</p><p> Will and Jack were equal co-owners of Will &amp; Jack&rsquo;s Dispensary, a relatively new Colorado-based business worth, according to a recent appraisal, $5,000,000. Will and Jack each received annual salaries of $375,000. The business had an additional $1,000,000 of EBITDA that the owners retained in the business to fund its healthy growth.</p><p> One dark and stormy night, lightning fatally struck Jack. His estate received $2,500,000 from Will&mdash;the full value of Jack&rsquo;s ownership interest and for which Will had an insurance policy on Jack&rsquo;s life for the full purchase price.</p><p> Before Jack&rsquo;s death, he and his family (a wife and three children) lived on Jack&rsquo;s salary. After Jack&rsquo;s death the $2,500,000 of sale proceeds generated about $100,000 to $125,000 each year (a four- to five-percent return).</p><p> Even though Jack&rsquo;s estate received the full value of his interest in the business, his family&rsquo;s income plummeted by two-thirds (from $375,000 to $125,000). Again, place the blame for the difference in the income to Jack&rsquo;s family on:</p><li> The Headwind pushing against investment returns</li><li> The disparity between the income that a business produces for its owner and that of investments of an equal value. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s Not Forget EBITDA </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is one more income-related asset that disappears at death&mdash;your now-deceased client&rsquo;s share of the EBITDA. If your client&rsquo;s business was successful, it likely had significant EBITDA. In Jack&rsquo;s case, his share of the EBITDA was $500,000 a year. In growing businesses (like Will and Jack&rsquo;s) that EBITDA is largely retained by the company to fuel growth. Even so, it adds to the value of the company and increases the capacity of the business to increase revenue and EBITDA in future years. The loss of EBITDA can be significantly greater than the loss of an owner&rsquo;s income and, at an owner&rsquo;s death (and transfer of ownership) that EBITDA now belongs to the successor owner.</p><p> In sum, before his death, Jack and his family enjoyed income and cash flow of $875,000 per year. After Jack&rsquo;s death, although his family received full fair market value of Jack&rsquo;s ownership interest in cash, their available income plummeted to $125,000 per year. </p><p> Lifetime Exit Planning, unlike buy-sell planning for owners, deals with this dramatic reduction in the income available to an owner&rsquo;s family at the owner&rsquo;s exit. We design exit plans based on securing the owner&rsquo;s financial security goal by the owner&rsquo;s planned departure date. If death intervenes, it is vital to provide that same level of financial security to the owner&rsquo;s family.</p><p> Simply having a buy-sell agreement that correctly establishes a current value for the company will not provide the level of financial security the departing owner&rsquo;s family needs. Owners must undertake, with your help, the estate planning necessary, using tools (such as life and disability insurance) that provide income protection if they die before their planned exits.</p><a href=\"https://www.exitplanningforadvisors.com/blog/death-and-family-security#_ftnref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [1]</a> Headwind 1: Long-term, mediocre investment climate; Headwind 2: A flat economy; Headwind 3: Higher taxes due on sale proceeds","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-07 00:19:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-07 00:19:08.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_PE2Lpq7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/death-and-family-security/\", \"post_id\": \"9075\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-07 00:19:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-07 00:19:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"death-and-family-security\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9074\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4317\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Death-and-Family-Security.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"654\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454933700,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

Be prepared to rethink how and with who you do business </strong></h3><p> <br/> We are all guilty of operating in our comfort zone, especially if we&rsquo;ve achieved some success doing things a certain way. &ldquo;What if I try something different and it doesn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; &ndash; looms large in our minds. <strong>  But historically it is the risk takers who win big. </strong></p><p> We see financial advisors on a daily basis who say they would like to grow their business and they like the idea of pursuing a female market but when faced with new and different ways of prospecting, especially if it might involve cost, they back right off.  They continue to do things the way they always have and hope for better or different results.</p><p> So be prepared to step out of your comfort zone because prospecting for female clients means that you have to be ready to invest your time and money to learn how to reach women on a personal level.</p><p> The good news is that studies have shown that advisors who take the time to attract female clients and develop a relationship with them have no fear of losing them to another financial advisor.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Brand your practice as &ldquo;female friendly&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> Speaking about stepping out of your comfort zone &ndash; brand your practice as &ldquo;female friendly.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Consider this: </strong> women control 1/3 of all assets and that's likely to grow to 67% of all financial assets &ndash; yet 73% are unhappy with the service they get, 87% claim they can&rsquo;t find an FA they can relate to and 80% of widows leave their existing FA&rsquo;s when their husbands die.</p><p> Women represent a huge market &ndash; <strong>  women are no longer a &ldquo;niche&rdquo; market &ndash; they are the market </strong> . And the female market is &ldquo;ripe for the picking&rdquo; for advisors who are willing to take the time to understand what women want and deliver services that relate to their lives. The caveat here is, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t fake it.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  3. Learn how to prospect &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not how you think </strong></h3><p> <br/> Prospecting is no longer just about hobnobbing on the golf course or glad handing at social functions. <strong>  Successful advisors understand that an ongoing, sophisticated and organized effort is required. </strong></p><p> The first step is to engage her, be honest about your own skills and interests, apart from managing money. If you already have a client base that includes some high net worth women and you would like to grow that sector and you personally understand and enjoy music, then organizing prospecting events at musical performances makes sense. You are very likely to attract like-minded. That immediately gives you a base for building a personal relationship outside of just her portfolio.</p><p> Of course if you hate concerts but love tennis, do an event around tennis &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you pick &ndash; the key is being genuine.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Learn from the top sales people </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s face it, you may be the best money manager on the block, but <strong>  if you can&rsquo;t sell your services or yourself &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be left behind. </strong></p><p> What&rsquo;s your process? Do you dive right into talking about your investment methods, or worse still, boast about your firm&rsquo;s investment performance? Many advisors feel that the best way to sway clients is to demonstrate their &ldquo;winning&rdquo; strategy. They are convinced that everyone wants to hear how successful they are. But that is totally not the case when it comes to women.</p><p> Women assume you know your trade going in or they likely wouldn&rsquo;t be there. What they are looking for is an authentic connection with you. So take a page from winning sales people&rsquo;s play book. Be honest, ask questions, be interested -- in your first meeting (for sure) you should be saying, &ldquo;tell me about yourself and what&rsquo;s important in your life&rdquo; and then actually listen and act upon what she says.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Put your ego in your pocket </strong></h3><p> <br/> Refer back to number 4 &ndash; the best sales people will tell you, meetings should never be about you or your product &ndash; it should always be about the client and what they need and that means you have to start by asking questions and listening.</p><p> No matter how tempting it might be to talk about how good you are at your job and the amazing returns you can achieve, remember it&rsquo;s not about making yourself look good, it&rsquo;s about making her feel good about herself.</p><h3> <strong>  Take away </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Be open and prepared to relearn and rethink how and with who you do business. </strong> Don&rsquo;t be driven by your own ego, be authentic and listen.</p><p> Learn how to <b>  Retain Female Clients </b> through this online course and earn CE credits.

{"original_id":4159,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Wider Perspective on Income Inequality","link":"a-wider-perspective-on-income-inequality","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Income inequality is a topic of passionate discussion today in many of the circles I move in.</h3>The discussion typically starts with a foregone conclusion that income inequality is a huge problem in the US. Some solutions I hear include increasing the top income tax bracket to 90%, initiating an annual wealth tax, or increasing the estate tax to 100%.While leveling the playing field will certainly solve income inequality, it won&rsquo;t solve the real problem. When I say that, I often get stares of bewilderment and disdain. It isn&rsquo;t unusual for people to slowly distance themselves as if I had shapeshifted into Donald Trump.<h3> First, how bad is income inequality in the US?</h3>It&rsquo;s certainly no worse today than it&rsquo;s been in the last 80 years. The <u> <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html\" target=\"_blank\">  CIA World Factbook 2015 Gini Index </a></u>, a rating where 0 is equal income and 100 is completely unequal income, finds the US rates a 45.0, exactly what it was in 1929. That puts us in 38th place, slightly above the global median, which is 39.4. The worst 30 countries have ratings of 46.8 to 63.2.Regardless of the fact that it has not increased over the last 80 years, what is the real problem with income inequality? A common assumption is that it has created an America where most people don&rsquo;t have enough to afford a minimal quality of life. But is that true?In a <u> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/economic-inequality-and-freedom/2015/10/16/db256346-7396-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  column from October 2015 </a></u>, George Will cites a new book, <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inequality-Harry-G-Frankfurt/dp/0691167141/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452540082&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=On+Inequality\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  On Equality, by Harry G. Frankfurt </a></u>, a Princeton emeritus professor of philosophy. Frankfurt drives home a main contention that economic inequality is not inherently morally objectionable and that &ldquo;doing worse than others does not entail doing badly.&rdquo; His alternative to economic egalitarianism is the &ldquo;doctrine of sufficiency,&rdquo; which is that the moral imperative should be that everyone have enough.<strong> Consider this.</strong>If you are a US citizen with an income of over $32,400, you are in the <u> <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/050615/are-you-top-one-percent-world.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  world&rsquo;s top 1% </a></u>. Globally, you are considered &ldquo;rich.&rdquo; Indeed, the poorest 1% of US citizens have more wealth than two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s people. Clearly, income inequality in the US doesn&rsquo;t inherently mean everyone in society doesn&rsquo;t have enough. This would suggest that complaints about US income inequality may be in response to something other than having enough.<h3> Perhaps the real problem is more of a &ldquo;discontent of those who are comfortable but envious,&rdquo; as George Will suggests.</h3><strong> Consider this:</strong>to be in the top 1% in income in the US you need to earn over $380,000 a year. Someone earning $32,400 a year, even though they are in the global top 1%, may easily lose that perspective when viewing someone earning over $380,000. The comparison could foster discontent by stirring up feelings of envy, jealousy, unworthiness, shame, and guilt. Rather than taking responsibility for and exploring these difficult emotions, instead we often shove them deep within and demonize others.Will suggests that the biggest underlying producer of income inequality is freedom. Freedom includes the power to choose careers, such as opting to be a teacher rather than an engineer with full knowledge that teachers generally earn substantially less than engineers. The economic and non-economic benefits of each profession are dictated by market forces, rather than those in government deciding the winners and losers.<h3> Envy of the rich is almost timeless and universal.</h3>Properly reframed, it also can be motivating. Contrary to common perception, 85% of the top 1% did not <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/estate-planning/leaving-money-to-your-kids-or-not\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> inherit wealth</a> but are first-generation millionaires or billionaires. Perhaps envy didn&rsquo;t drive them to try to tear down what others had achieved. Instead, it motivated them to build their own success.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-07 16:09:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-07 16:09:30.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_dMs3z2k.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-wider-perspective-on-income-inequality/\", \"post_id\": \"9079\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-07 16:09:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-07 16:09:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-wider-perspective-on-income-inequality\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9078\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4319\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A-Wider-Perspective-on-Income-Inequality.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"765\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454943600,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

The cornerstone of the foundation of the advisor business in the future must be a client-centered purpose&hellip; without it advisors don&rsquo;t stand a chance&hellip; Advisors in the future will create  <u>  powerful purpose statements </u>  which differentiate them from advisors who continue to use catchphrases, value props and elevator pitches.</p><h3> Sales or service&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Product sales has its place but not in the collaborative world of wealth-care&hellip; Always be closing??? or Always be Collaborating? The days of clients and prospects being sold on advisor selling capability are waning&hellip; The advisor in the future will sell the appointment, not the product&hellip;</p><p> The elevator pitch is being replaced by the appointment script&hellip; because  <u>  prescription without thorough diagnosis is malpractice </u> &hellip; advisors in the future will not waste time selling products or services to prospects without first setting the appointment. For the advisor in the future, the appointment is the first &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p><h3> Collaboration over consulting and sales&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Advisors in the future will be collaborating with clients who are considered trusted partners.

The reality of the digital age of transparency unveils this fundamental truth, the receiver of your digital marketing material doesn&rsquo;t care about the sales pitch&hellip; they don&rsquo;t even care about the solutions (yet)&hellip; they care about their issues.</p><p> The digital marketing progression for gaining interest from ideal clients is straightforward&hellip; here are the issues, here are the options, here are the solutions&hellip; If the issue is real to me, then I (the prospect) will discover your options&hellip; then (call to action) I may chose your solution if, and only if, it is a good fit for me. Advisors in the future will acknowledge this  <u>  fundamental truth </u> &hellip; they can&rsquo;t be all things to all people. Advisors in the future will be leveraging this fundamental truth by first defining the solutions they provide when they  <u>  customize their advisor alpha </u> . Bottom line&hellip; there is too much digital noise to &ldquo;think and do&rdquo; any other way&hellip; there simply isn&rsquo;t enough time.</p><h3> Authenticity Integrity Trust and Accountability&hellip;  </h3><p> <br/> The advisor in the future will understand&hellip; they must own perception of their authenticity by owning the words&hellip; Not &ldquo;owning the words&rdquo; that define their authentic value is tantamount to shuttering their business tomorrow.

To accomplish this, advisors in the future will require a trusted collaborative partner who can help them with The How by simplifying the complexities that are inherent in the digital age of transparency.

We then wonder why we meet price resistance.In my previous<a href=\"/grow/development/fees-the-problem-is-what-we-say-is-not-what-they-hear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  post </u></a>I discussed one way of remedying that: we must position what we do in such a way that it is immediately understandable, and desirable.  If we get that right the value becomes immediately apparent to the client, and as a consequence there is no significant price resistance.  Who regrets getting good value?Some planners and advisers do however believe so strongly in the proprietary process, or the comprehensive planning service that they see it IS the value for clients.  Of course, they may well be quite right. However, describing a process which is essentially technical in nature and somewhat mysterious to the average consumer, and then asking the consumer to<strong> &ldquo;trust the process enough to pay for it in advance&rdquo;</strong>is a challenge.  The consumers do generally feel that they are paying in advance, even if our invoice is not presented until after they have received the plan, because the plan itself has not proven its worth until they have followed the recommendations and allowed the requisite time to pass to see the results.If one is wedded to the process and wishes to make that the core of the value proposition and simultaneously minimise price resistance, then an excellent strategy is to break it down and sell the components.  Don&rsquo;t sell the entire comprehensive planning process at one relatively large fee.  Sell it in instalments at modest and affordable feels.To illustrate let&rsquo;s use just a couple of examples of the very front end of Financial Planning&hellip;.the most boring (yet potentially most important) parts for most consumers: cash management and debt management.<img alt=\"\" height=\"234\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-07-at-8.39.42-AM-2.png\" width=\"555\"/>I would guess that a lot more potential future clients would be interested in these services, rather than &ldquo;financial planning&rdquo;:<li> <strong>  &ldquo;Show Me The Money&rdquo;service: </strong> for a flat fee of $400 (for example) we can figure out how to find spare money from your household income, to help fund the holiday you want or buy the next toy&hellip;or whatever drives you.</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Freehold Home Owner&rdquo; service: </strong> for a flat fee of $400 (for example) we will figure out the way for you to pay less in interest on your home loan (which is usually many many thousands of dollars!) and own it faster</li><li> <strong>  &ldquo;Peace Of Mind&rdquo; Plan: </strong>  for a flat fee of $400 (for example) we will work out how you can get rid of debts as quickly as possible, and get the majority of financial stress out of your life</li>This is just a couple of quick and easy examples to make the point: We are usually dealing with people who have a particular hunger now, and they want it fixed quickly and easily.  They want to grab something from the drive-through window at a fast food joint, and we talk to them about a 7 course degustation dinner which we promise will be a life-changing experience for them.  They want fast food and we are often talking about fine dining.  The result? We struggle to get engagement.Break the skills and services down into digestible chunks for them, and put it in language which links the service to the outcome that you help them achieve.You won&rsquo;t find any serious price resistance then.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-07 16:57:18.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-07 16:57:18.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_3fxeaK3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-theres-a-struggle-to-obtain-buy-in-from-prospective-new-clients/\", \"post_id\": \"9094\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-07 16:57:18\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-07 16:57:18\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-theres-a-struggle-to-obtain-buy-in-from-prospective-new-clients\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9092\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4322\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Theres-a-Struggle-to-Obtain-Buy-In-From-Prospective-New-Clients.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"664\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1454961720,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4163,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Defines You As A Successful Person?","link":"what-defines-you-as-a-successful-person","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Today&rsquo;s blog post is by my  <u>  <a href=\"http://altris.co.nz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Altris  </a> </u>  buddy, Kelly Samson, who is one of the nicest people I met in 2015. He offers up some serious food for thought around how we identify WHO we are by WHAT we do.</p><p> Tom knew it was coming, they all knew. The slow-moving restructuring juggernaut, chewing up departments and teams as it went.  He&rsquo;d been through numerous restructures and was considered a veteran. He felt suitably blas&eacute; and weary of the process.</p><p> This time, however, it was different. As he read the letter, the cold, emotionless word &lsquo;disestablished&rsquo; jumped out at him and suddenly, he felt vulnerable. That endless list of important meetings and tasks, which only moments ago had been such a huge priority, suddenly seemed trivial. There was no escaping it this time.</p><p> As he drove home that night, Tom allowed himself a moment of introspection as he let the consequences of the day sink in. With the sudden loss of his job, which had taken up so much of his life, he pored over questions he had never considered before.</p><h3> What actually defines me as a person?  Is it the job I have?  Is it the job title stamped on my business card?</h3><p> <br/> Didn&rsquo;t I seem more &lsquo;big league&rsquo; when I had the letters, Director, GM or VP after my name?</p><p> Is it this mask I wear while I play the role I&rsquo;ve been assigned?</p><p> The bigger my job title, the bigger my pay check &ndash; does it mean I am a more important person than the next?  More important than the person who&rsquo;s trying to talk to me? Tom sheepishly admitted to himself that he had thought it did.</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s the busier I am?  If I am always rushing from appointment to appointment and multi-tasking, that must mean I&rsquo;m succeeding, doesn&rsquo;t it?  He started to recognise that on many occasions, he had been there in body but never truly present for his friends or colleagues.</p><p> What happens when this role ends?  What happens when the title and pay-check are suddenly no longer there?  Tom asked himself, &ldquo;Who am I then? Is that the person I want to be?  </p><p> Tom wasn&rsquo;t sure.</p><p> Or, is there more to me, more to me feeling successful as a person that I can&rsquo;t see?  There must be something deeper and more authentic than this role I fill from 9 &ndash; 5? Or, in Tom&rsquo;s case, often from 7 &ndash; 6.</p><p> I can now see I carry this job title with me like a badge of importance.  Is that important to the people who mean the most to me, my family and friends?  </p><h3> How authentic am I actually being?</h3><p> <br/> With these reflections, Tom began to see the role for what it was.  He held it but he didn&rsquo;t own it. However, he had let it own him and he had defined his success as a person by it.  Someone had held this role before him and someone would hold it after he was gone.  He now could see how he was often filled, even overflowing, with self-importance because of his job title. But that feeling had just been an illusion &ndash; the job title didn&rsquo;t give him real fulfilment and success.</p><p> What really defines you as a successful person?</p><h3> Are you defined by your role, your job title and your paycheck?</h3><p> <br/> Tom realised that when his role finished, and all roles will all end one day one way or another, the legacy he wanted to leave behind was how people felt when he connected with them and how he helped them, in the ways he could.</p><p> He could now see that he wanted people to know and remember him for being a truly authentic person, who was present to hear them &ndash; and not for the position he held.  This is the successful person he aspired to be &ndash; someone bigger than any title or paycheck he could temporarily hold.</p><p> His ideal successful self would be known by the people he met because of his integrity, authenticity, kindness and leadership.  He now defined his success by being true to his values, making a positive difference and giving back whenever he could.</p><p> Unlike Tom, you don&rsquo;t need to lose your job to think about what defines you as a successful person.</p><p> What will enable you to look back on your life and feel fulfilled and proud?

{"original_id":4164,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Technology Killed Work-Life Balance — Here's How to Fix It","link":"technology-killed-work-life-balance-heres-how-to-fix-it","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Thanks to the ubiquity of mobile devices and the acceleration of networks, it&rsquo;s easier than ever before to stay connected to your job. </h3><p> <br/> It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are or what time it is. All you need is an Internet or network connection, and voila, all of those work-related emails are right in the palm of your hand. </p><p> While it&rsquo;s certainly advantageous for management &mdash; employees are always connected &mdash; technology has essentially killed work-life balance. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gfi.com/blog/survey-81-of-u-s-employees-check-their-work-mail-outside-work-hours/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   GFI  </a> </u> , 81% of workers check their email outside of regular work hours. This is terrible news for employees, and perhaps most importantly, their families.</p><p> Just imagine the parent who&rsquo;s barely listening to their son&rsquo;s story about what happened that day at school because they're checking that awesome email their boss sent at 8:52 p.m. on a Tuesday night.</p><p> In order for your employees to be most productive, they need to be well-rested. They need to have downtime where they&rsquo;re not thinking about work at all. Our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/lt-employee-retention-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Employee Retention Report  </a> </u>  found that:  <strong>  A positive work-life balance equals a 12% lower chance of attrition. </strong></p><p> Consider the following tips to improve work-life balance at your organization, which will, in turn, improve your employee retention:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Respect after hours </strong></h3><p> <br/> If your organization operates on a standard 9-to-5, then it&rsquo;s high time you start practicing what you preach. Stop sending your employees emails in the middle of the night and expecting prompt responses.</p><p> From time to time, you&rsquo;ll most likely have to break that rule &mdash; and that&rsquo;s fine. Sometimes, work calls for all hands on deck, long into the night. But for the most part, work can stop when employees leave the office. Let it.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Let your employees work remotely </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the easiest ways to improve work-life balance is to allow your employees to work from any location they&rsquo;d like. You don&rsquo;t have to allow them to work from home or from the road every single day. But allowing them to work remotely from time to time will almost assuredly improve work-life balance.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Let your employees work flexibly </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can also improve your employees&rsquo; work-life balances by allowing them to work flexibly. Some workers are night owls, and they might be considerably more productive working 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. Other folks might prefer to work four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days.</p><p> So long as your employees are getting their work done on time &mdash; and they don&rsquo;t miss any important meetings &mdash; does it really matter when they work?</p><h3> <strong>  4. Encourage employees to exercise during the day </strong></h3><p> <br/> Countless studies have documented the relationship between exercise and productivity. According to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/10/regular-exercise-is-part-of-your-job/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> , exercise helps us learn faster, improves our memory, makes us more creative, and allows us to focus more intently on the task at hand, among other benefits.</p><p> Instead of forcing your employees to exercise before or after work, why not allow them (or even encourage them) to break a sweat during the day? As an added bonus, the quality of their work will improve.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Consider innovative perks </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are only so many hours in the day. When we&rsquo;re immersed in our work, it can be difficult to find the time to take care of our day-to-day chores.</p><p> You can improve work-life balance by offering your  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/5-unexpected-employee-retention-strategies-that-really-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employees innovative perks  </a> </u> .

As the article notes, many B2B marketing surveys discuss the topic of content marketing from the marketer's perspective.</p><p> For example, the Content Marketing Institute published the <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2016_UK_Research_FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  results </a> of their annual B2B content marketing survey towards the end of last year. The report focused on issues such as the effectiveness of content marketing and specific tactics used. This is hugely valuable reading for B2B marketers and I highly recommend checking it out.</p><p> Other reports, such as DemandGen Report's annual B2B buyer's <a href=\"http://www.demandgenreport.com/resources/the-2015-b2b-buyer-s-survey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  survey </a> and annual content preferences survey, explore the topic from the buyer's viewpoint - such as the type of content they prefer, and how they use it in their purchasing decisions.</p><p> In similar vein is an excellent recent study by <a href=\"http://bluenileresearch.com/compeltobuy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Blue Nile Research </a> :  They spoke to 528 B2B and B2C buyers about their content marketing preferences and here are some findings from the B2B respondents:</p><h3> Cold, hard facts hit the spot with B2Bs <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_2000,q_90,w_1200/v1/75010/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUMAAAAJGFkODUwYjAyLWU5MWQtNGM5Yy1iNTM4LWY1OWE0YWU5ZWRhMg_qh16xp.jpg\"/></p><p> According to Blue Nile, B2B buyers favour content that's based on data and statistics (see above chart) - a view held by nearly half (46%) the respondents when asked which is the single most effective type of content to most compel them to click on a link. This was followed by a blog post or video content, each with a respective 18%, and infographics with 10%.</p><h3> B2B buyers are omni-channel (and you should be too)</h3><p> <br/> More than three-quarters (76%) of B2B survey participants use three or more channels when researching or communicating with a brand during their purchasing decision, while more than a quarter (26%) use five or more! This means producing quality content isn't the only important thing - it also needs to be delivered via multiple channels.</p><h3> B2B buyers use search and brand websites for research</h3><p> <br/> When asked what channels they used during the research stages of a purchase, 80% of respondents stated online search or a brand's website and just over half (54%) looked at reviews and case studies.</p><p> Are you giving your buyers what they want from your content?

Or, you smiling at a stranger, just as they needed to receive a smile. These are the events unexplained by logic, reason, and probability, yet are the foundation and guiding principles of faith.</p><p> <strong>  How many of us have had these &ldquo;coincidences&rdquo;? </strong> Generally they go by the wayside and we talk about them for a few days, later to forget them in the hustle and bustle of our daily lives.  But really these occurrences must not be ignored. You see, our sensibilities, that which keeps us thinking we are sane, practical, logical, rational&mdash;that which locks into the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world and what we see as grounded&mdash;is based on predictions of cause and effect, as well as probability and statistics. Namely, our rational belief systems are based on the physical laws of the universe.</p><h3> However, there are events happening in our lives, every day, which defy probability.</h3><p> <br/> You can keep chalking them up to coincidence to make them fall neatly into our practical world. Nevertheless, think about that last time you heard your favorite song, or the song you needed to hear, precisely at the time you turned on the radio or changed the station. Recently, I had an unexpected cancellation in my office schedule, freeing me up to travel to see a patient in the hospital, much earlier than my planned after office visit. Getting into the car, I checked my emails and saw that my wife had forwarded one from my son Jeremy, then out of the country. As I turned on the car and opened the email, a song played on the radio by the band Pearl Jam...the name of the song: Jeremy!</p><p> Okay, no biggie. I mean the sky did not open and the heavens rain with singing angels and the voice of God. Although, maybe it did. When we are open to such occurrences, they actually seem to happen more often. Mostly they defy any type of logic and defy statistical analysis. The odds are astronomical of two people crossing paths at exactly the same time, as happened to my family and me, when bumping into my college roommate while on vacation some years ago.  The permutations in their life and your life for that moment to intersect do violate mathematical sensibilities.</p><h3> To me, these coincidences are magical.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  I have coined a term for them: Daily Magic. </strong> Many of you have met me through <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/CoachMD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Facebook  </u> </a> .

I encourage you to start a revolution of #DailyMagic on Twittter and Facebook. Post your &ldquo;coincidences&rdquo; there. The more this catches on, the more we will all begin to see the connection of something more than the limitations of our physical world and our primitive nature. Doing so will open up access to our divine nature&mdash;that which connects all of us&mdash;and will help you to live with purpose and passion.

Sinegal turned the reins over to Craig Jelinek, a nearly 30-year employee. The fact a member of Costco&rsquo;s leadership team was tapped to become the retailer&rsquo;s second CEO shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to anyone who is familiar with Costco&rsquo;s business strategies. Costco explicitly focuses on developing people and promoting from within.Costco operates nearly 700 warehouses globally; almost 500 in the U.S. Costco&rsquo;s 2015 fiscal year ending August 30, showed sales up 3%, while net income rose 15.5%. Perhaps most importantly, their member base grew by 6%.<h3> <strong>  Costco Members </strong></h3>Costco, a membership driven warehouse club, makes nearly all of its profits from membership fees. That&rsquo;s right. They do little more than break even on revenues from warehouse sales.Member loyalty was superb in 2015. Costco measures member loyalty by renewal rates and shopping frequency. Over 91% of U.S. members renewed their memberships. Shopping frequency increased 4%. And, Executive Members now account for over one-third of members and two-thirds of sales.Costco members are a coveted group. They are generally college educated with a household income over $100,000, twice the national average.And, it is Costco employees who are charged with, and receive accolades from taking great care of members. The first paragraph of Costco&rsquo;s 2015 Annual Report includes the statement: &ldquo;&hellip;accomplishments were possible because of the dedication and hard work of our more than 200,000 Costco employees around the world.&rdquo;*<h3> <strong>  Costco Employees </strong></h3>Costco leadership makes clear that they value, respect and view taking care of and developing their employees as top priorities. Examples:<li> Costco pays more than other retailers, with an average employee making about $21/hour</li><li> Costco provides about 90% of their employees with health insurance and other benefits</li><li> Most of the leadership team (including the current CEO) started out in warehouses</li><img alt=\"Craig Jelinek\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://alchetron.com/cdn/w-craig-jelinek-56ab04bc-87b8-4f37-b5c5-ba4768125e3-resize-750.jpeg \" width=\"239\"/><strong> Craig Jelinek, CEO since 2012</strong>&ldquo;Most of our managers and executives started out in the warehouses and we like to promote from within because it&rsquo;s difficult to understand how what you do affects the warehouses unless you&rsquo;ve worked in one.&rdquo;&ldquo;Costco has always offered good wages and benefits because we don&rsquo;t want people to be worrying about those things. We need them to focus on their jobs.&rdquo;&ldquo;People are key&hellip;primary job of our warehouse managers is to develop people because people are the key to our success.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  People Development </strong></h3>In 2012 CNBC ran a documentary on Costco called <u> <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/the-costco-craze-inside-the-warehouse-giant/\" target=\"_blank\">  The Costco Craze </a></u>. Among many topics, they reviewed how Costco had become the #1 wine retailer in the world, selling more than $1 billion in wines annually. In addition, Costco has become the largest importer of high-end marque wine brands.So, what&rsquo;s the background of the woman leading the wine category for Costco? Formal, wine education? A career as a master sommelier? Nope. Costco. She learned the wine business to excel in her role. In my view, that&rsquo;s a pretty strong example of promoting from within.Employee Focus Drives SuccessA recent Fast Company article, <u> <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3040830/world-changing-ideas/can-treating-low-wage-workers-well-become-the-hot-new-business-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Can Treating Low-Wage Workers Well Become The Hot New Business Strategy? </a></u>** noted: <strong> &ldquo;Companies with higher wages often achieved a &lsquo;virtuous cycle&rsquo; of higher customer satisfaction, better employee retention, increased profits.&rdquo;</strong>Costco certainly fits that profile. Costco has the highest employee retention level in the U.S. and sales per employee are nearly twice that of Sam&rsquo;s Club. They pride themselves on keeping a small-company mentality even as they grow by keeping things simple.Clearly Costco&rsquo;s focus on employees is tied to ongoing stellar performance.<h3> <strong>  Action Items: </strong></h3><li> Evaluate how your organization&rsquo;s pay and benefits compare to your strongest competitors and to your industry sector overall. If you&rsquo;re not at or near the top, consider changing your business strategy to a &ldquo;Good Jobs&rdquo; strategy.</li><li> Assess the current priority of &lsquo;develop your people&rsquo; among your leaders&rsquo; responsibilities. If it&rsquo;s currently not a high priority, consider the benefits, such as higher retention rates and being able to promote more often from within.</li><li> Are you and your leadership team both talking the talk and walking the walk of &ldquo;Our Employees are Our Greatest Asset&rdquo; daily? If not, evaluate ways to integrate demonstrating the value of your employees into daily business activities.</li>* <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83830&amp;p=irol-reportsannual\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Costco&rsquo;s 2015 Annual Report </u></a>** Costco&rsquo;s focus on employees is tied to ongoing stellar performance.

It occurred to me, though, that the most stressful time for an advisor who plans on jumping ship is the time &ldquo;in between&rdquo;&mdash;the time from deciding it&rsquo;s time to go to the time one actually makes the leap.</p><li> <strong>  What are the questions an advisor needs to ask of the prospective new firm(s)? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What are the things that a responsible steward for clients should be concerned about? </strong></li><li> <strong>  And, if faced with multiple offers from multiple suitors, how does an advisor ultimately choose the right new home? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Understanding what you need to know BEFORE you start the decision-making process is key to answers made from a state of calm, rather than the panic of pressure and time. Here is a 10-point list that will keep you focused on the right information.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Name brand </strong></h3><p> What will resonate the most with your clients, prospects and centers of influence? Has the brand been tarnished at all?</p><h3> <strong>  2. Capabilities </strong></h3><p> Can the prospective firm fully support your business? Do you do any type of niche business or specialized work for clients that might not be supported elsewhere? In-depth platform review is critical: Make sure that every aspect of your business is vetted&mdash;loan rates, private equity lock-ups, credit card capabilities, international capabilities, special arrangements regarding client fees, and any other &ldquo;one off&rdquo; agreements you might have in place.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Local and regional management </strong></h3><p> They are the faces of the firm, your champions and advocates, and will be your blockers and tacklers&mdash;how well-connected are they? What is their background? Do they see the world as you do? How well respected are they by the advisors who work for them and by senior leadership?</p><h3> <strong>  4. Senior leadership </strong></h3><p> Be sure you understand the direction, goals and vision of the firm. Where does the firm generate most of their revenue? Where will they invest the most? Will your niche business continue to be a strategic priority for them?</p><h3> <strong>  5. Transition deal and ongoing payo </strong></h3><p> How much of the overall deal is guaranteed? How much will you have to grow in order to hit all back-end bogeys? Will the firm reimburse all of your unvested deferred comp? Will it be replaced in cash or with a cliff vest? Can you negotiate any portion of the deal; that is, to be paid more up front, to have back end bonuses structured so that you will have the ability to earn the greatest percentage of bonus money in the years you are likely to generate the greatest amount of revenue? What will your payout be at this firm? What has been the firm&rsquo;s history in changing advisor comp?</p><h3> <strong>  6. Support Staff/Expenses </strong></h3><p> How would this move impact your staff? Will your support staff be given a raise? Will you have to contribute to your staff comp? Will you be able to hire additional support as part of this move? Will the firm offer you marketing, travel and entertainment expense money, especially for the first year after the move? Will the firm reimburse you for attorney&rsquo;s fees?</p><h3> <strong>  7. Growth </strong></h3><p> How will this firm help you to grow faster and more efficiently? What will they do to invest in you?</p><h3> <strong>  8. Succession planning </strong></h3><p> What kind of plan does the firm have in place for retiring advisors? How does that plan compare to your current firm and others? What sort of flexibility will the plan allow you in terms of how to choose your successor and how much you want to work when the time comes for you to exit the business?</p><h3> <strong>  9.

{"original_id":4169,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Case for Evolving the Quality Factor","link":"the-case-for-evolving-the-quality-factor","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Applying the Quality Strategy to an Expanding Menu of Goals</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  INTRODUCING THE FLEXSHARES QUALITY LARGE CAP SCORE </strong></h3><p> <br/> Any effective investment process typically seeks to remain aligned with its driving forces while delivering performance in changing macro environments. When investors begin to use an effective process in unanticipated ways, however, we believe it is especially noteworthy. In recent years, the quality factor has advanced along such a path.</p><p> The quality factor originally was designed as a tool to gain confidence in the financial strength of dividend-paying equities, but investors have steadily evolved how they use it in their portfolios. Instead of looking at dividend-paying equities as a means to meet income needs, quality dividend payers can also be looked at as a means to grow assets through capital appreciation. Similarly, combining the quality factor with yield may make sense from a total return perspective, since dividend yield can be looked at as a way to gain exposure to the value factor.</p><p> Yet, we realized that even though a quality dividend strategy can be used to help meet capital appreciation goals, its application has certain limitations. Key among these is the exclusion of non-dividend payers from the starting universe of investable equities.</p><p> In our continuing mission to develop products that meet investors&rsquo; real-world needs, we created the FlexShares Quality Large Cap Score and our newest exchange traded fund, FlexShares US Quality Large Cap Index Fund (QLC). Here&rsquo;s our thought process.</p><h3> <strong>  DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF QUALITY </strong></h3><p> <br/> Originally, when we explored applying our dividend quality score (DQS) methodology beyond common stocks, we determined that each asset type required distinct modifications to the template. Using a cookie-cutter approach across asset types would not work.</p><p> For example, we realized that the unique aspects of real estate investment trusts (REITs) required a different application methodology than was needed for common stocks. REITs, because of their tax requirement to pass on the majority of their earnings directly to their unit holders, did not produce the same financial data as common stocks, such as net income. So we reexamined the metrics driving the DQS score and determined that we needed to modify the methodology for the REIT space. We use the resultant real estate quality score (REQS) in our global quality real estate strategy.</p><p> Our methodology for evaluating the credit quality of U.S. corporate bonds also required a modified process. Using insights from our DQS and REQS processes, we developed a proprietary credit scoring methodology as a replacement for traditional Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ratings.</p><p> All of these processes rely on the same foundational principles, but recognize that each asset type/class is unique &mdash; so much so that, to fruitfully apply our quality approach, each quantitative implementation has to be modified.</p><p> Coming full circle, we found that the universe used to apply our quality approach to dividend-paying equities ended up being quite similar to the universe used for large cap stocks &mdash; but it, too, required certain &ldquo;tweaks.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  WHY QUALITY LARGE CAPS? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Applying quality to a non-dividend-paying large cap universe is a natural extension of our product suite and one that we believe enables us to better address the specific goals of large cap equity investors.</p><p> We think the domestic large cap space is exceptionally fertile ground for using our proprietary multi-factor quality approach. The extensive depth and history of financial data for these companies makes research quite robust, which in turn boosts convictions about how different factors perform in various market cycles. And, liquidity and capacity issues, which may affect small caps or certain foreign markets, are generally not a concern.</p><p> This progression also makes logical sense when you consider the pillars that drive our FlexShares quality scoring process:</p><li> Management efficiency is a quantitative evaluation of a firm&rsquo;s deployment of capital as well as its financing decisions. Firms that aggressively pursue capital expenditures and additional financing generally lose flexibility in both advantageous and challenging portions of the market cycle.</li><li> Profitability scores a firm&rsquo;s relative competitive advantage across several different metrics. Firms with wider margins may be better positioned to grow compared to firms with slimmer margins.</li><li> Cash flow assesses the liquidity levels of the company. A firm that cannot meet its debt obligations and day-to-day liquidity needs will be poorly positioned to take advantage of future opportunities or enjoy a financial cushion during periods of distress. <br/>  </li><p> We apply this methodology to companies on a sector basis in order to:</p><li> Provide an &ldquo;apples-to-apples&rdquo; comparison, since different sectors &mdash; such as utilities and technology companies &mdash; vary considerably in how they profile;</li><li> Find quality companies in every sector without concentrating in certain pockets of the market; and</li><li> Prevent unintended stock selection and weighting biases caused by a dramatic sector drift from the starting universe. <br/>  </li><p> We believe applying these metrics is not only a great way to judge a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain and grow its dividend, but also to gain insight into its overall financial health &mdash; and that holds true for dividend and non-dividend payers alike. <br/>  </p><h3> <strong>  DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES WARRANT DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS </strong></h3><p> <br/> The FlexShares Quality Dividend Fund (QDF) 1,250-firm universe provides a robust selection of quality companies that pay dividends. Therefore, it aligns with investors&rsquo; expectations about how to generate reliable income.</p><p> But quality-focused investors who want a total return strategy that stacks up against other large cap options may find that the quality dividend strategy has too much mid-cap exposure, which could result in periods of performance drift versus large cap competitors. A large-cap-only quality strategy that includes non-dividend payers would access the full opportunity set and easily work with traditional investor allocation and risk frameworks.</p><p> We realized that when the investment objective changes from a focus on yield to one of capital appreciation, it also changes the way the strategy seeks to capture the compensated risk factor, freeing up the design to examine other factors.</p><p> For example:</p><li> Is there a better proxy for value?</li><li> Moreover, why not evaluate several different metrics in order to get a full perspective on a stock&rsquo;s value exposure instead of relying on a single ratio? <br/>  </li><p> Additionally, for tax-sensitive clients, maximizing dividend yield1 instead of value can be a less effective way to capture returns, because dividend income creates a capital gain that must be paid in the year realized. In contrast, capital appreciation represented by unrealized rising asset prices can be flexibly managed by the investor vis-&agrave;-vis timing. This is an important distinction for investors seeking total return but not necessarily income.</p><h3> <strong>  WHAT EXACTLY IS THE APPROPRIATE LARGE CAP UNIVERSE? </strong></h3><p> <br/> While it may look deceptively simple, a lot of care went into determining the parent large cap universe. All risk controls and diversification constraints relate to this starting point. Our goal was to create an &ldquo;investability&rdquo; universe that tracks closely to legacy large cap benchmarks while also allowing the most robust opportunity set for our quality process.</p><p> Why not just start with a legacy benchmark? We examined legacy benchmarks and proxies and believed we could do better. We thought that a more robust starting universe would be advantageous if it allowed more dispersion in returns between companies with attractive factor exposures. Also, it would help limit concentrations in sectors with fewer qualifying constituents, such as telecom, utilities and materials.</p><p> We examined several different breakpoints for the starting universe. In the end, we chose the largest 600 companies that passed our investability screens. This starting universe provides the greatest number of securities for us to evaluate, while keeping tracking error2 , sector and style bets to a minimum. </p><h3> <strong>  THE FLEXSHARES LARGE CAP QUALITY (LCQ) SCORE &mdash; A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO VALUE </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Combining Quality and Value </strong></p><p> While quality is a powerful factor on its own, we believe combining it with value makes each factor even stronger. By focusing on large caps and looking beyond dividend payers, a robust definition of value that combines several metrics can be used. Again, similarly to our quality process, we apply three lenses:</p><li> Contemporaneous metrics use the latest reported filing data to calculate the valuation metric. This provides a view on where the company stands today. Accessing a firm&rsquo;s most recent earnings report to calculate price-to-earnings (P/E)3 would be an example of a contemporaneous metric.</li><li> Normalized metrics smooth out the data by calculating an average over several years. Normalized measures remove the effects of the economic cycle and aberrant events that may distort the valuation. Shiller&rsquo;s CAPE (cyclically adjusted P/E)4 is an example of a normalized valuation calculation.</li><li> Forward-looking metrics employ future estimates to aid in understanding where the company is going and how future data may be reflected in its stock price. A P/E calculation that uses an analyst&rsquo;s estimate of future earnings instead of the latest reported value would be an example of a forward-looking metric. <br/>  </li><p> We believe the combination of these different lenses of valuation informs a stronger understanding of how a company&rsquo;s stock price is valued today, in the future and with respect to historic norms.</p><p> <strong>  Combining Quality and Value with Momentum </strong></p><p> Targeting undervalued companies that exhibit financial strength also provides a strong foundation on which to build an investment strategy. However, by utilizing market-sensitive data (not just company-reported data), the model may be further improved to help avoid value traps. We use momentum to measure the market sentiment for the company as it is reflected in the stock&rsquo;s price. We evaluate momentum in two ways:</p><li> Using the stock&rsquo;s price history to capture a picture of the recent past; and</li><li> Using analyst outlooks to get an understanding of future sentiment regarding the company. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Combining All Three Factors </strong></p><p> While each of these three factors works well in isolation, the combination of the factors &mdash; and how they are combined &mdash; are just as important. We selected the three factors and determined the process for combining them quite deliberately. Each step has distinct and paired significance. Two factors that are lowly correlated5 or even negatively correlated can have a powerful effect on one another and their combination typically smooths the cycle for each factor, dampening the swings that each would experience in isolation. Also, each is additive in achieving the objective of the fund, something that is often overlooked. </p><p> The goal of diversifying different factors is similar to that of diversifying a basket of stocks that are not highly correlated: both processes seek more desirable performance on a risk-return basis. Historically, value and momentum have negative correlation to one another.</p><p> The fact that low correlations between the factors may be beneficial when combined informs the decision on how best to conjoin the factors. We believe that the most effective way to capture factor exposures is by applying all three factors to the starting universe at the same time. Because of their low individual correlations, applying the factors separately then combining the results may actually dilute their combined effectiveness (i.e., you could end up with some exposures to poor quality, overvalued and negative momentum holdings.)</p><h3> <strong>  QUALITY AND LARGE CAP NOW IN ONE PORTFOLIO </strong></h3><p> <br/> The LCQ measurement process creates an alpha6 score based on the three targeted factors, which maximizes the strategy&rsquo;s exposure to quality, value and momentum. The strategy strives to harness each factor through its selection and weighting process. Additionally the strategy seeks to limit non-targeted factors by placing sector, security, style and market volatility bounds relative to the starting universe.</p><p> This simple but powerful investment process allows the strategy to focus on those traits that we find the most attractive, while it minimizes unintended exposures that are not part of the design. It also has the potential to make capturing the factor more efficient, since the generated tracking error supports the pursuit of compensated risks rather than non-targeted, idiosyncratic risks.</p><p> Lastly, the new FlexShares US Quality Large Cap Index Fund strategy can replace a legacy large cap strategy in an existing allocation model with few follow-on adjustments needed to the model&rsquo;s sector, style and stock exposures. This ease of implementation may help minimize the time and expense associated with portfolio reconfiguration.</p><p> <strong>  FOR MORE INFORMATION visit us  <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-evolving-quality-factor-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    here   </u>  </a>  .  </strong></p>1 Dividend yield for an equity security is calculated using the (expected) annual dividend divided by the most recent closing price. To calculate annual dividend, we utilize the most recent dividend payment and multiply that payment by the expected frequency over a year. For example, if the most recent dividend for a company is $2.50 and dividends are expected to be paid quarterly (4 dividend payments/year), the annual expected dividend would be calculated as $2.50 x 4 dividend payments/year, or $10.<br/>2 Tracking error is a divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark.<br/>3 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a ratio for valuation ratio calculated as a company&rsquo;s current stock price divided by its earnings per share.<br/>4 Shiller&rsquo;s CAPE (cyclically adjusted P/E) &ndash; also known as the P/E 10 ratio &ndash; is a valuation measure, generally applied to broad equity indices, that uses real per-share earnings over a 10-year period. The P/E 10 ratio uses smoothed real earnings to eliminate the fluctuations in net income caused by variations in profit margins over a typical business cycle. The ratio was popularized by Yale University professor Robert Shiller, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2013. It attracted a great deal of attention after Shiller warned that the frenetic U.S. stock market rally of the late-1990s would turn out to be a bubble.<br/>5 Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.

I have a little window into the odd world of women for you.</h3><p> <br/> Want a fascinating peek into human behavior&ndash;especially women&rsquo;s often baffling choices? I am mildly obsessed with the show Dating in the Dark. In this show, 3 men and 3 women show up to a house and &lsquo;date&rsquo; each other in a completely dark room. It basically takes looks out of the equation and forces the singles to choose their partner based on personality alone. They go on group dates and one-on-one dates and in the end they &lsquo;reveal&rsquo; their physical appearance. Then, they can choose whether or not they want to continue dating after they have seen the person. It&rsquo;s pretty great / trashy TV.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s helpful for us: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Snooping on Romance:  </strong> There is nothing better than watching two people try to build a connection and flail through awkward first impressions, get to know you conversations and trying to kiss (ya seriously) in the dark without ever having seen each other.</li><li> <strong>  Simmered Attraction:  </strong> Attraction is physical. Sexual chemistry is based on looks&ndash;mostly. It&rsquo;s also chemical and based on pheromones. So when you take out the appearance ingredient, all kinds of magical and interesting things happen.</li><li> <strong>  Raw Body Language: </strong>  Another thing that happens in the dark is you get to see body language unfiltered. Since the daters aren&rsquo;t trying to physically impress their dates (since they can&rsquo;t see each other) they focus on their words, and body language goes on the back burner. This lets us see an unfiltered look at attraction and disgust body language. <br/>  </li><p> Many of our dating students know about my obsession with the show and one of our awesome readers (thank you Wouter Cox!) sent me an episode of Dating in the Dark that is a behavior Gold Mine!</p><p> Here is the full episode:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-08-at-9.38.58-AM-2.png\" width=\"477\"/> <br/> click to view</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a look at the particularly interesting female behaviors in this episode.</p><h3> #1: Women Do the Opposite of What they Say</h3><p> <br/> Did you catch it? I actually laughed out loud after the initial group date. Why? In the beginning of the episode, all three women say they like a man with a sense of humor. In fact, 2 of them say it is the most important thing to them. Then, two of the men focus on being funny during the group date&ndash;make the women laugh and have a grand ol&rsquo; time. But guess what? The women leave the first group date and PUNISH the men for being funny. They are like, &lsquo;oh they just weren&rsquo;t taking it seriously&rsquo; and &lsquo;they were so focused on jokes.&rsquo; And so ALL THREE PICK THE ONE UN-FUNNY GUY.</p><p> What the what? Women are terrible! They said they wanted funny, got funny and then rejected them for being funny.</p><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s madness&ndash;no wonder men go crazy trying to date us! </strong></p><p> But to be real, I can so relate. If I am being honest, I think women do this all the time. Just the other day, I asked my husband to try to take more initiative to get himself healthy breakfast in the morning and then when he did, I got mad at him because I had made him breakfast and it was waiting in the fridge. Oops. Even I realized how confusing it was. I often wish he could just read my mind. </p><h3> #2: What Women Actually Want</h3><p> <br/> Ask most women what they are looking for in a relationship and they will tell you:</p><li> Funny</li><li> Smart</li><li> Successful</li><li> Attractive</li><li> Honest <br/>  </li><p> You know what they don&rsquo;t say? Social proof. But guess what? That&rsquo;s what actually works. My favorite part of this episode was when the producers showed all 6 daters clips of their friends talking about them. One of the men (brilliant) chose to have his female friend recommend him. The girls ate it up. ALL THREE CHOSE HIM. That almost never happens on the show. Why? Social proof is a powerful persuasion tool.</p><h3> #3: Women Pick the Same Men Over and Over Again</h3><p> <br/> I thought it was very amusing when during the early part of the show, Adele says something like, &ldquo;I usually like assholes, but I am trying not to do that now.&rdquo; Then what does she immediately do? Pick the asshole. In my opinion, David was the biggest jerk on the show and of course, she chose him. Why? We are sticklers for habit. As humans, we tend to be attracted to the same kinds of people over and over again&ndash;even if they look different, we like to have personality fits based on our genetics, history and spot in life. Typically, we pick people who fill an emotional need. Why Adele gravitates towards &lsquo;assholes&rsquo; in her own words? Only she could tell us&ndash;or maybe she couldn&rsquo;t. We are terrible at recognizing our own patterns. My guess is that somehow they make her feel like the good girl. I won&rsquo;t psychoanalyze her right now, but I do challenge you to think about this:</p><li> Who do you pick over and over again?</li><li> What emotional need are they filling?</li><li> What emotional need are you filling in your partner? <br/>  </li><p> For me, my husband is a rock. He is super calm, super stable and I love that about him. He grounds me and me frenetic, constant energy.</p><h3> #4: Attraction Is Blind</h3><p> <br/> Take a look at the date with Adele and Ben at 15:00. Man, oh man, this is the perfect example of what the body does when it is attracted to someone. Adele ends up choosing Ben, and you can predict that just by watching this date. Remember, they hadn&rsquo;t even seen each other yet, but you can already tell they are super into each other. Typical attraction cues you can see here:</p><li> Leaning into each other</li><li> Head tilts</li><li> Mutual laughing</li><li> Excuses to touch</li><li> Attempts at making eye contact even though they can&rsquo;t see each other <br/>  </li><h3> #5: Mucking Up First Impressions</h3><p> <br/> When you take the physical out of the first impression, it really messes things up. No one picked right in the beginning. That&rsquo;s because we need nonverbal and physical cues to truly gauge if someone could be a good match.

{"original_id":4171,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 Destructive Relationship Patterns","link":"7-destructive-relationship-patterns","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There are many things that can ruin a relationship - infidelity, addictions, ongoing poor and ineffective communication - to name but a few.</h3><p> <br/> However, there are many things that couples do that, at first glance, don't always appear that detrimental. But, over time, the foundation of the relationship does get affected and they eventually become the bigger things - the bigger things that can irretrievably break the relationship.</p><h3> <strong>  Communicate through texting.  </strong></h3><p> Most of us are guilty of attempting to have a 'too long' conversation via text. However, problems will arise if this is the main way you communicate. So much communication is lost through texting because there is no element of body language - which is essential for effective communication and connection. Problems inherent in doing this are magnified when either one or both have been drinking - which many of the couples I see, do. Drinking not only decreases our inhibitions and ability to stay rational but increases our impairment with unclear thinking and poor decisions. It's just a bad cocktail. Texts are seldom deleted and then brought up again and again because they are hurtful.</p><h3> <strong>  Lack of common courtesy.  </strong></h3><p> Whether it be when you are running late because of a work commitment or transportation is thwarted (bad traffic, delayed trains) people don't take the 10 seconds it would take to communicate this to their partner/spouse. Just doing this would quickly diffuse a person's anger - and fear. A lack of common courtesy is also happens when one person has been asked to do something and they don't confer with their partner/spouse first. They continue to make unilateral decisions. Many people say they feel like they are asking permission and have the attitude that they 'would rather ask for forgiveness than permission.' But this is simply not true. By including them in your plans, you are creating a stronger bond and reinforcing the trust and 'we are a team' attitude.</p><h3> <strong>  Speak negatively of your partner or spouse.  </strong></h3><p> I have been in the company of others when one person speaks ill of their partner. Boy, that is uncomfortable, isn't it? They do this in a 'funny' way, but it's actually very hurtful to the other person. Although we all have those things that drive us nuts about our partner/spouse, saying those things in the company of others hurts both the person and the relationship and also reflects poorly on you.</p><h3> <strong>  They don't ignore the small slights. </strong></h3><p> There are small slights that happen frequently in relationships. But does everything really have to be an issue? Why is it so difficult to look past some of the small slights in life and focus on the bigger picture, the positives of that person? Would you treat your good friend in the same fashion? I doubt it. However, if there is something that really is a trigger for you, why not take the time and have an honest conversation? This would, no doubt, leave both of you feeling better about your relationship.</p><h3> <strong>  Bring up the past.  </strong></h3><p> People do this often and typically end up hurting their relationship. All this really shows is 1.) they still are unable to get past an issue and thus they need to talk about it more or 2.) they are still angry or 3) they know that by bringing up the past will hurt their partner and because they haven't resolved the issue in their own mind and feel justified. Either way, bringing up the past never works unless it is done with care, compassion and a real need to understand something so that you can put it behind you.</p><h3> <strong>  Distraction rules.  </strong></h3><p> Somewhere along the line, the TV, our phones, iPads, computers, and social media has morphed into being something way more important than being present with our partner/spouse - especially when they are attempting to have a conversation with you. Why is that? Doing that speaks volumes and implies these things are more important and significant that you are.</p><h3> <strong>  Not thanking your partner.  </strong></h3><p> When your partner or spouse does something - things like taking out the trash, cooking dinner, picking up your dry cleaning, running an errand - many people just don't say thank you. By not doing that, you start to take both your partner/spouse and the relationship for granted. When I offer that to couples, one person is often defensive of that and asks why they have to thank their partner for doing something that maybe they both do or is just part of life. It really is about acknowledging your partner; it is important to be grateful, attentive, and present. It's about the team effort.</p><p> I have found that these are some of the things that really can break a relationship and undermine the trust, safety, and security that a relationship needs to survive.</p><p> Are you guilty of any of these? If so, what will you do to change them? The health of your relationship depends on it.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-08 17:53:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-08 17:53:03.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_aOO9Z9D.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-destructive-relationship-patterns/\", \"post_id\": \"9112\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-08 17:53:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-08 17:53:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-destructive-relationship-patterns\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9111\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4331\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/7-Destructive-Relationship-Patterns.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1024\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455037200,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}

You&rsquo;ve tossed or stored the decorations and reordered your space (and your life) to January normal.</h3><p> <br/> The last reminders of celebration are the credit card bills that rolled in on schedule. If your New Year&rsquo;s resolution was to be more financially responsible, this arrival might have seemed more like a January 1 hangover&mdash;and the world seems bleak.</p><p> If this sounds familiar in any way, you are not alone. If this seems normal, then the time has come to question the sanity of this annual routine that drop-kicks you into money misery. Whatever lofty goals you set on January 1 have been supplanted by the urgency to deal with bills that are neither comfortable nor in alignment with your plans for financial success.</p><p> Your choice now is to feel miserable and remorseful about those poor decisions OR (waaaaay better) to channel that energy into a positive plan to create a new and better reality. If you haven&rsquo;t clicked off by now, you probably are interested in finding a constructive solution to a more satisfying financial life.</p><h3> But where to start?</h3><p> <br/> The answer is simple: a change is necessary&mdash;from your mindset to your actions. Say it out loud: &ldquo;I have to make a change!&rdquo; There, you didn&rsquo;t die from saying it and chances are you will be able to navigate change without costing you a limb or an essential organ. So let&rsquo;s start these seven steps to back away from financial failure:</p><li> <strong>  Acknowledge&mdash;right upfront&mdash;that change doesn&rsquo;t come easy. </strong> There is some level of pain involved. But let&rsquo;s be honest, how pain-free is that January credit card bill? Yeah&hellip;right?</li><li> <strong>  Create a goal that would make you feel good, satisfied and proud. </strong> For example: &ldquo;My goal is to be credit card debt-free.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s your goal, so name it. In fact, write it down. Your words have power.</li><li> <strong>  Look at your numbers. </strong> Let&rsquo;s start with something easy&mdash;grab your last few bank statements and list the amounts deposited vs. the amounts spent. Now, let&rsquo;s go a little deeper. Pull out your fixed costs&mdash;whatever you are contractually liable to pay each month (rent, mortgage, car payments, etc.) Whatever is leftover is a mix of discretionary or partially discretionary spending.</li><li> <strong>  Go back to your goal. </strong> What is it? Why is it important? Is it important enough to make some shifts in your spending? Is living in money misery acceptable?</li><li> <strong>  Now, come back to your numbers. </strong> What can you stop doing? What can you shift in order to create the surplus necessary to pay off your credit cards or move you closer to your goal each and every day, week, month. Remember, it&rsquo;s a matter of mindset and the steps you create to reach your goals.</li><li> <strong>  Test your results. </strong> If you are saving $100 per week, are you paying off an additional $100 per week on your balances? Chart your progress. If you change your spending habits and replace them with savings habits, you should see, in very short order, the results clearly stated in your bank account.</li><li> <strong>  Celebrate your victories and learn from your missteps. </strong> If you have a lifetime of less than stellar money habits, don&rsquo;t expect miracles or overnight solutions. Being mindful of your decisions and going back to your goals will keep reinforcing why you are making these efforts. It&rsquo;s worth it. <br/>  </li><p> Imagine yourself, a year from now when the January bills roll in. They are manageable and within reason. You feel good about yourself, your progress and the decisions you&rsquo;ve made to put you into this more favorable position.</p><p> Just think, it seems like only yesterday when you were hyperventilating and now you are feeling the peace and happiness of a life in control. <strong>  Go for it&mdash;your happiness is worth it! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-08 18:07:19.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-08 18:07:19.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_PN2mkYF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/seven-steps-to-pull-back-from-financial-failure/\", \"post_id\": \"9114\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-08 18:07:19\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-08 18:07:19\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"seven-steps-to-pull-back-from-financial-failure\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9113\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4332\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Seven-Steps-To-Pull-Back-From-Financial-Failure.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"824\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455030000,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s hard to be sure what we want her to know.  Does she want to know how it&rsquo;s going with the project?  Does she want to know about the meeting I just wrapped up?  Does she want to know how my birthday dinner went last night?  Does she want to know if I like my job and if I&rsquo;m happy?  Does she want to know how I&rsquo;m feeling?  Does she want to know if I&rsquo;m having any problems?  Does she want to know what I think about our new office?

Interesting.</p><p> I see this sort of thing, this human phenomenon, wrecking havoc in our workplaces. It&rsquo;s not intentional.  Nobody is trying to be evasive, or sneaky, or a slacker, they&rsquo;re just horrible mind readers, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel safe to take a stab in the dark.</p><p> You see, how people respond is largely based on how we frame what we ask.  If we want to really know about something, we have to make it safe for people to say what&rsquo;s real, removing the ambiguity from our questions, so they know what kind of information we&rsquo;re looking to find.  As leaders, we need to be more mindful about framing our questions.</p><p> If we want to really know about something, we have to make it safe for people to say what&rsquo;s real.</p><p> But we can&rsquo;t frame effective questions if we don&rsquo;t know what information, specifically, we need, so that&rsquo;s the place to start.  Instead of lobbing a general, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; out into space, it&rsquo;s important to stop and ask yourself, &ldquo;What do I need?&rdquo;</p><p> I need to know if there&rsquo;s anything that&rsquo;s going to get in the way of us hitting our deadline.</p><p> &ldquo;What are your biggest roadblocks?&rdquo;  (By framing the question around the roadblocks, because that&rsquo;s the information you need, you make it safe to &ldquo;out&rdquo; the roadblocks by assuming there are some.  If you simply said, &ldquo;Are you having any problems?&rdquo; you&rsquo;re likely to hear, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; because they won&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s safe to have any.  The truth is, if there ARE roadblocks, you need to know about them &ndash; like it or not.  If there aren&rsquo;t any, they&rsquo;ll happily report that, but if there are&hellip;now you&rsquo;ve made it safe to share them with you.  The standard &ldquo;Will you hit the deadline?&rdquo; would never give you the information you need to head any problems off at the pass&hellip;)</p><p> I need to know what&rsquo;s being accomplished.  Or, I need to make sure my employee is engaged.</p><p> &ldquo;What are your big wins this week?&rdquo;  (Framing the question around &ldquo;big wins&rdquo; gives people a chance to talk about their achievements and is a massive engagement-driver.  You&rsquo;ll also get to hear what&rsquo;s going right for a change, which is good for your own sense of engagement.  Having a chance to connect with each other over good news goes a long way towards establishing trust and building a strong relationship.

The big concern is about pricing oneself out of the market. Yet, by under-valuing products and services, the effort becomes hardly worthwhile.</p><h3> Sell value and deliver excellence in service to enjoy a loyal clientele</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  My Story </strong></h3><p> One company, for which I worked, paid lucrative bonuses for selling at list price. New on the job, I asked the top salesman how he was able to do it. Believing a woman would never have the guts to do the same, he gave me all of his tips. They were outstanding tips. By month four, I was the new top producer.</p><h3> <strong>  Initial Conversation </strong></h3><p> An initial conversation could apply to someone contacting you, meeting at an event, or having a first appointment. All of these scenarios require that you ask in your own words, &ldquo;What specifically caught your interest?&rdquo;</p><p> If there wasn&rsquo;t any interest, the other person would have removed themselves from your presence immediately, or certainly would not have contacted you. Asking the question puts the ball in their court and almost always the need to answer is recognized.</p><h3> <strong>  Mirror Behavior </strong></h3><p> Most often people will try to &ldquo;kick the tires&rdquo; or say &ldquo;no need, just curious&rdquo;. At the first encounter, nothing is known about you so you have to prove you bring added value to the table above your competitors.</p><p> Once the prospective client answers the question provided above, mirror the &ldquo;just curious&rdquo; mentality. Reveal you are simply there to introduce what it is you have to offer.   Then state that it may or may not fit within their requirements, but it is in their best interest to research all options. Add that&rsquo;s why you chose to spend the time with them. This will put the dialogue on a completely different plane.</p><h3> <strong>  Express Your Disclaimer </strong></h3><p> Once past getting acquainted, state that you may not be the least expensive provider. Quickly add the reasons why this is the case. Emphasize your unique style of delivery and quality customer care. It must all be true.</p><h3> <strong>  Budget </strong></h3><p> Early in the conversation ask for the client&rsquo;s budget. This part of the conversation also leads to asking for the perceived timeline for getting started. You now have greater insight about the need, want and desire, and may more adeptly move to the invigorating part of the conversation.</p><h3> <strong>  Buy-Ins </strong></h3><p> It is said you need 3-5 buy-ins to get get to a sale. This is accomplished by asking questions throughout the conversation that lead to a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; answer.</p><h3> <strong>  Example of a buy-in </strong></h3><p> Share a short story of how a client benefitted enormously from your help. Then turn this back into a question of, &ldquo;Do I sound like the type of vendor with whom you might like to work?&rdquo; The answer should be an obvious &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p> Selling value sells professionalism and transforms into the  <a href=\"http://www.smoothsale.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Smooth Sale! </a></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-08 18:19:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-08 18:19:13.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_pJPazI1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-build-value-and-build-the-sale/\", \"post_id\": \"9120\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-08 18:19:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-08 18:19:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-build-value-and-build-the-sale\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9119\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4335\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Build-Value-and-Build-the-Sale.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"520\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455024600,"author_id":161,"chart_url":""}

It must have deep meaning to you and your life and you must be able to articulate WHY it is so important to you.</p><p> A college education, masters or graduate degrees, and industry training have minimal value to your success in the absence of singleness of purpose. Certainly with a good education and training, success can be achieved but it is a mere shadow of what can be accomplished when driven by singleness of purpose. It is often our own limiting beliefs that prevent us from finding our true path to success.</p><p> <strong>  Each of these women discovered what they were passionate about, and put all their efforts into their singleness of purpose. </strong> They weren&rsquo;t worried about pleasing others in fact in many cases displeased many, yet regardless of the challenges, nay Sayers and obstacles their pure authentic focus moved them to greatness. A singleness of purpose can build a successful business, inspire millions of people, start revolutions it may even move mountains.  </p><li> <strong>  Wilma Rudolph: </strong>  Born prematurely, weighing a mere four and a half pounds. At age 4, Rudolph contracted polio, forcing her to wear leg braces for five years and orthopedic shoes for two years after that. Just 5 years after she found running she made her first performance in the Olympics and eventually claimed three gold medals.</li><li> <strong>  Valentina Tereshkova: </strong> Before being recruited as a cosmonaut, Russian Valentina Tereshkova was a textile-factory assembly worker and an amateur parachutist. She was selected out of more than 400 applicants to pilot the Vostok 6, and on June 16, 1963, she became the first woman and the first civilian in space.</li><li> <strong>  Malala Yousafzai: </strong>  By age 10 Malala was becoming a spokesperson for girls education in Pakistan. At the age of 15 a Taliban gunman shot Malala Yousafzai in Mingora, Pakistan yet she was not swayed from her purpose to provide all girls the opportunity to get an education.  At 17 Malala was the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. <br/>  </li><h3> If singleness of purpose can have that great an impact on the world and the success of others why as financial advisors are we hesitant to define our own driving force?</h3><p> <br/> Target markets, niche markets are an industries unsuccessful attempt to adapt to social and cultural changes in training but most often have little relationship to the soul of the advisor and as a result little impact on their success.</p><p> <strong>  The financial industry was built and developed by warriors whose single purpose was to bring home the bacon.  </strong> The model worked in a day when the world was narrower and culturally limited. .  But our world has become more diverse, more receptive to cultural changes, gender integration and social sensitivities.    <strong>  The days of hunters and warriors have changed and bringing home the bacon is not enough. </strong>  </p><p> Advisors armed with singleness of purpose and with the courage to challenge status quo will find their success goes well beyond monetary compensation.  They feel a sense of fulfillment, peace and passion. Their purposeful focus will provide constant motivation fueling their actions and conversations each and every day.</p><p> <strong>  Women have become a powerful source of purpose for many advisors regardless of gender.  </strong>  In my work coaching advisors the process of writing their story &ldquo;Why they care about women&rdquo; they quickly uncover a sense of purpose that had long been buried.  Advisors with 20 years of experience become recharged and encouraged as they unleash their true desire and purpose as an advisor. For some it&rsquo;s simply feeling permission to finally follow what their heart and soul has been telling them for years. Typical clients appointments become intimate discussions inspiring new referrals, assets and mutual respect.</p><p> New advisors, challenged with growing a business find tremendous clarity and focus when they are able to hone in on their singleness of purpose. Their focus, vision, actions and strategy all become more focused and their message with strangers has an immediate impact.</p><p> Whether your singleness of purpose is women, business owners, young professional couples determined to achieve early success, or people of faith who strive to be good stewards of their wealth it is WHY they are important to you that makes it powerful.   <strong>  When you uncover that singleness of purpose, you will ignite a fire in your soul that will reflect in your message, actions and interactions. </strong> You will experience a fuel that sparks meaningful interactions, stronger relationships, more natural referrals and the ability to bring home more than just bacon.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-08 18:44:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-08 18:44:15.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_MPU4AlD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-secret-to-success-for-advisors-is-no-secret-at-all/\", \"post_id\": \"9122\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-08 18:44:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-08 18:44:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-secret-to-success-for-advisors-is-no-secret-at-all\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9121\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4336\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Secret-to-Success-for-Advisors-Is-No-Secret-at-All.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"632\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455039900,"author_id":5,"chart_url":""}

(I have taken some liberty to paraphrase the commentary for the interest of length).  Listen to the original comments and what we covered in the second half of the webinar in the replay link above.You can also download Capgemini's latest white paper on the <u> <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/resources/evolution-of-automated-advisors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Evolution of Automated Advisors </a></u>.<strong> Bill - </strong>We have seen some very strong High Net Worth Individual growth. The U.S. grew 9%, adding over $1 trillion in wealth and is the largest HNWI market globally.  However Asia-Pacific passed North America to become the region with the highest number of high network individuals.  Last year we saw India (26%) and China (17%) lead the charge.  None-the-less, each of the top 5 cities in the U.S. (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, and San Francisco) have higher HNWI populations than India (11th largest HNWI population country in World).<strong> Rachel -</strong> We certainly are seeing and doing everything we can to continue to serve the wealth that is growing. Geographic concentration always helps us.  Certainly among the high net worth, we are going to talk a lot about digital disruption which we do embrace.  For HNWIs that have complex needs, being in the old guard traditional part of the industry, we can bring to bear a lot of resources, and some of those are certainly going to be in person.  Geographic concentration certainly helps us, but digital also enables us to tap into wealth throughout the country.<strong> Jill - </strong>The traditional Wealth Management industry is battling against a lot of different forces - A lot of regulation since the financial crisis, margin pressure, a lot of consolidation, and some demographic shifts. We see studies that say Millennials don&rsquo;t want to talk to anyone. They trust technology more than financial institutions. We see the Millennial Disruption Index, which was put out by Scratch, a division of Viacom, some stats that are mind-blowing.  71% of Millennials say they would rather go to a dentist than listen to what banks are saying. Nearly half are counting on tech start-ups to overhaul the way banks work.  2/3 say in 5 years the way we access our money will be totally different.<strong> Hart -</strong>If you think about the Millennial generation, they have almost a sense of entitlement to have access to information, to transparency, to being able to understand and see how things work. They have a distrust of the pinstripe financial adviser if you think of it in stereotypical terms. What I think the Millennial generation is really doing, powered by the roboadviser trend, they are forcing the wealth manager to define their true value-add and to really justify what they are offering past basic investment management.<strong> Hart (in reference to what is OpenFolio)</strong>- We&rsquo;re not providing advice at all.  We let you see how your financial portfolio compares to others.  We take 60,000 users that have shared their investment portfolios. Not how much money they have, but investments in percentage terms.  We push them together into a global data set to produce our investor average.  It is effectively a benchmark that is a proxy for how the retail investor is actually doing.  For us, that is just a tool for transparency to create a better, more engaging benchmark to let a user understand how their investments compare.  It&rsquo;s not advice, but it is a hook, it's the top of a funnel to help a user look at their finances more critically and bring interesting questions or thoughts to their human adviser to help them make better sense of their own investment situation.<strong> Jon -</strong>We don&rsquo;t see it at Betterment as so much of a generational shift, such as a societal shift. Sometimes it looks like it starts with younger people, but we found at Betterment and our business most of our business comes from non-Millennials. In fact, something like 30% of it comes from customers that are 50 plus.  The way that people are looking to manage their money is changing.  It&rsquo;s not so much that they just like technology better than humans.  I don&rsquo;t think if you polled people they would say they like their computer more than humans.  It&rsquo;s that they like things that are transparent.  They like things that are repeatable and evidence-based. And you can have either a human adviser or a technology interface-driven interaction that is evidence-based, and repeatable and transparent.  To us, at least what we are hearing from our customers, that is what they value.  It is the quality of that experience being something they can dig into and understand and repeat.  If they were to follow the same rules again they would get the same result.<strong> Rachel -</strong>We do find in the wealth business for Wells Fargo we do skew older, which is pretty traditional in the industry. We do find there is a great demand and desire for digital engagement with advisers across a range of needs.  In terms of value add, advisers need to add value beyond investments.  This is a good thing for the consumer and also good for us in the industry.  They are getting increasingly managed more efficiently and the transparency there is really important to the consumer and it is important to performance.What advisers need to do is add value beyond investments. I think particularly for the high net worth there is a lot of opportunity to do that. There is a lot of needs around wealth transfer and charitable giving. There are complexities for higher net worth individuals for concentrated positions or private equity exposure, or types of exposure that senior leaders might have outside of a traditional stock and bond account.  There are a lot of different ways to add a lot of value.  The opportunity and the challenge in the industry is to really be able serve and deliver value and also to adjust our models in terms of how we engage and charge for our services, to evolve from an asset-based approach to a more broad-based one.<strong> Hardeep -</strong>When I say it (roboadvisers) is not disruptive, it does not mean it is not an important advancement. It just doesn&rsquo;t change the economics to serve.  Our early adopters at Motif were actually retirees, mainly because they have money and they have time to try something new. Millennials don&rsquo;t have money generally and we as an industry have a tendency to skew.The issue with robos not being disruptive is kind of like my worst nightmare.  If you can wake up one day as CEO of a start-up and have all the big guys in your industry take five months to do what you did in five years.  It is pretty frightening from that perspective where everyone today is building robo capabilities.  It is an important feature set, but it&rsquo;s not changing at all.  What robo technology has allowed a lot of people to do, its changing the economics.  For people who can&rsquo;t afford an advisor now have for simple scenarios an opportunity to have managed advice, if you will.  I don&rsquo;t actually subscribe that robo is actually advice, but it is allocation models. They have done it beautifully.  They have done it in ways that are simpleOne way that millenials are very different is they care what they are invested in. This is something that hasn&rsquo;t been addressed very well.  This generation cares about doing good with their money. When we look as advisers at helping and serving this audience, especially the high net worth component, a lot of it is about how you do good with the money while making a return.<strong> Jon -</strong>I would expand on what Hardeep said about the level of advice you can get. I think there is sometimes a misconception among some in the industry that when we talk about advice, we&rsquo;re talking about portfolio construction. That is table-stakes and I would agree that is pretty easily commoditized.  There have been portfolio construction things out there for 20 years.  I think where Betterment takes off is that's the starting place.  We had that 15 years ago.Where we&rsquo;ve innovated is in providing more holistic advice after you have a portfolio construction.  What should your glide path look like, how much should you invest, how much should you put into your Roth IRA, how much into a taxable account, how much into a 401k, can we tax manage across all of those things, can we avoid wash sales, when you need to make a major purchase take it out of the right goal etc, .  It&rsquo;s really holistic financial planning to take into account all of your outside assets, your income, your spouse&rsquo;s income, joint account if you have one, where you want to retire, I could go on and on.  This is the kind of stuff everyone wants.  It&rsquo;s not just what should my portfolio be.  It&rsquo;s given how the amount social security benefit that I have, how much more do I need to save before I retire.  We&rsquo;re answering those questions today at Betterment.  I do think there is a lot of advice that can be made accessible now to everyone that historically was only available to people who could afford a great and expensive adviser.<strong> Hart -</strong>I agree with Jon in where Betterment is going to provide more advice.  But the starting point where Betterment started and competitors are now stuck, was roboadvisers as an automated investing service as a basic allocation service.   If you look back at the high-end of the RIA market, outsourced investment management has existed for years in the forms of turnkey asset management programs that hold $2 trillion of wealth under management.  What the roboadviser has done brilliantly is market direct to consumer the fact that investment management and asset allocation can be a service provided for low cost (25 basis points or less). And in doing so, they have forced the consumer to question their human adviser.   Hey, what am I paying for here?  If investment management is an outsourced service that costs 25 basis points or less, what is my 1% wrap fee getting me?  What is the value-add in this equation?<strong> Bill -</strong>We asked HNWIs how open they would be to leveraging a roboadviser type kind of capability or an automated advisory services. We found almost 50% of HNWIs globally were open to leveraging it. Although it was a bit lower in the U.S. at 34%. However, when you start looking at the dynamics of ages, that&rsquo;s when your eyes start to open.  For those under age 40, over 70% were open to leveraging it.  For those under 30, 87% were open to leveraging it.  And of those that were under 30, when you ask how much would you consider being managed by that type of capability, 77% of those said they would be willing to put over half of their assets into that kind of a tool.  As what others are saying, this is becoming table-stakes.  However, it is not going to replace the wealth manager.  It&rsquo;s is going to place the focus on what is the value proposition of a wealth manager.   What are you doing to deliver the value for those services.  It&rsquo;s not just about your ability to properly put together an asset allocation.<strong> Rachel -</strong>The traditional industry has often historically struggled with serving broad-based family needs and younger family members because of their pricing model and the portfolio management part of the business in some ways was challenged from a scalability point of view. I think digital advisory can help us more holistically serve families based on different needs across the family and different price points.With regards to digital needs beyond advisory or digital needs among the high net worth, we research and get input from our own clients and prospects. People have much increased needs, and it is not just demographic. What we&rsquo;re hearing from our customers is they want to engage with us in a multi-channel way and they want to be able to digitally engage with their advisers.  High net worth have time challenges and there may be multiple family members.  Being able to make appointments and interact with their advisers across different locations and family members via video is becoming increasingly important.  Video conferencing as well as being able to review and do what-if&rsquo;s around financial plans, not just investment plans, but financial plans online.  A lot of interactive planning type of needs.  There is a need, even among high net worth, around financial education.  How can we help continue to educate and add value with our clients in that capacity?  We need to bring to bear, certainly with high net worth, more than just investment advice.   We need to bring to bear other experts and resources in a team-based way as needed, whether be trust or asset protection with insurance, or other types of banking, other types of capabilities for broad-based needs.   We need to be able to bring the team and resources in a multi-channel way.  These are all things that frankly put pressure and emphasis on digital roadmaps and traditional firms to be able to deliver against these types of broad-based needs. <strong> Hardeep -</strong>A lot of next gen investing, even the current gen investor, wants to understand what they are getting involved in. A lot is about having a conversation.  I know with my adviser after a while it gets boring just looking at my asset models and looking at a report on how I am doing. Now you can have a productive conversation about what I am invested in and what are the underlying strategies with the asset model.  Core asset allocation is going to get commoditized.  For advisers, what else is left after you take that aspect out?  A lot is about relationships and having a differentiated view on the markets and being able to give tailored advice.  Really, really hard today, especially in high net worth situations, to get tailored financial advice from a robo product.The challenge for most people is how do we get to the millennial generation.  That is what big institutions are trying to figure out.  There are big, tectonic shifts in demographics.  We all feel it in our businesses. The question for incumbent firms is how do we work to use this technology to get into this next generation segment before they become high net worth customers so we can build those relationships.<strong> Bill -</strong>We noticed that high net worth individuals are interested in leveraging these kind of automated advisory services, but they are not looking to replace their advisers. But when we ask their wealth managers, there is still some denial in that their high net worth clients are not interested in leveraging automated advisory services. Less than 20% of wealth managers felt their clients would ever consider using automated advisory services.If we look back 10 or 15 years ago, we were having similar discussions with the private banking industry saying their clients would never interact with them digitally.  It is such a face to face, personal relationship, there is never any need or demand for us to be leveraging digital tools.I remember having a conversation with a CEO of a large European bank back in 2005 when I was living in Paris.  He told me point blank you are an arrogant American to think that my clients are ever going to engage with us online.   Now, if you look at what that firm is working on now in terms of its digital initiatives, there is a lot going on.  It&rsquo;s about enhancing and leveraging digital to deliver more value to your clients and to enhance the relationship and value proposition.I think that&rsquo;s related to roboadvisory services.  The good wealth managers are going to be able to effectively incorporate this into how they are serving their clients and the weaker ones will struggle.  It is really around defining what your value proposition is and how you provide holistic wealth management to your clients beyond just investment advice.If you found this dialogue interesting, please check out the full replay at<a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/s/nam/16/1/wc/digital-disruption\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  here </u></a>.You can also explore the findings from Capgemini's Wealth Reports at <u> <a href=\"http://www.worldwealthreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  www.worldwealthreport.com </a></u> and follow the discussion on Twitter at #WWR2015.","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-08 19:52:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-08 19:52:29.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_gPlaDnp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/digitalization-of-wealth-management-disruption-or-evolution/\", \"post_id\": \"9126\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-08 19:52:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-08 19:52:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"digitalization-of-wealth-management-disruption-or-evolution\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9123\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4338\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/75-of-High-Net-Worth-Individuals-Plan-to-Invest-More-in-2016.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1142\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455008400,"author_id":63,"chart_url":""}

Will they owe this year or get a tax refund?</p><p> The economic demands of our day make this season of stress even more challenging for many. With income barely meeting their needs and unexpected expenses straining an already tight budget, many people dread the thought of an additional tax bill. On the flip side is the relief felt when they find that they&rsquo;ll be getting a refund check in the mail.</p><p> Knowing that the anxiety-inducing job of filing a tax return is inevitable simply means that postponing the task just adds to the stress. So no matter what you may expect, whether good or bad, the first step in easing the stress is to get down to business. Then, once you know the outcome, you&rsquo;ll have time to decide how to ease the burden of a tax bill or the best use for a tax refund.</p><h3> You owe the Taxman!</h3><p> <br/> Taking the worst-case scenario first, finding that you owe the IRS. First off, don&rsquo;t panic even if the amount is beyond your ability to pay within the 10 days allotted after the IRS has made the assessment of what you owe. You need to be proactive in finding a solution while protecting your assets. No one will come to arrest you, but you will begin to get threatening notices before you&rsquo;ll be contacted by a revenue officer. Quick action will help prevent the harassment and additional penalties and interest.</p><p> The first question to ask is whether you actually owe the money. A simple mathematical error can mean the difference between a refund and a tax bill. Thoroughly review the forms you filed for discrepancies. Better yet, pay a professional tax preparer to go over your returns again. If you discover that you definitely owe the IRS, you have multiple options to repay. Some will reduce the net amount owed; others will increase your overall payout.</p><p> An installment plan is the option used by taxpayers who owe less than $25,000. Fill out  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Form-9465\" target=\"_blank\">  IRS Form 9465 </a> , a straight forward, form used to request a monthly payment plan. Provide the total amount you owe, how much you are able to apply to the tax bill right now and the amount you can pay each month. The IRS then can adjust the agreement or offer other arrangements.</p><p> Other options for taxpayers who owe money include account receivable and bank levies, wage garnishment, penalty abatement and what&rsquo;s called an &lsquo;offer in compromise&rsquo; which lowers the amount owed. However you decide to address your obligation to the IRS, the sooner you pay it off, the less you&rsquo;ll pay in interest and penalties.</p><h3> Whoopee! A Refund!</h3><p> <br/> While celebrating may be overkill, taxpayers who are getting a tax refund can breathe a sigh of relief for dodging a tax bill. They now have an opportunity to make wise use of a tax windfall.</p><li> <strong>  Invest/Save: </strong> One of the most fiscally responsible uses would be to deposit it into a 401k or other  <a href=\"http://www.kjhfinancialservices.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  investment fund </a>  that earns interest.</li><li> <strong>  Pay off Debt: </strong> While increasing your investment accounts has obvious benefits, the decision to pay down debt is a stress reliever for anyone who carries a balance. Lower debt has the potential to move your credit score in a positive direction making future borrowing easier. <br/>  </li><p>  Experiencing less stress during tax season comes when you pursue excellent financial management all year long. Avoid becoming overwhelmed by consistently burning the midnight oil and sacrificing entire weekends to work. Focus on balancing work and your private life. Set financial goals and celebrate milestones.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-08 20:07:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-08 20:07:50.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_242zPkw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stressful-time-income-tax-time/\", \"post_id\": \"9127\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-08 20:07:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-08 20:07:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stressful-time-income-tax-time\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9128\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4339\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stressful-Time-\\u2013-Income-Tax-Time.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"687\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455048000,"author_id":282,"chart_url":""}

A Lesson From the Mayo Brothers","link":"how-much-do-we-really-need-a-lesson-from-the-mayo-brothers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I just read an inspiring article about the Mayo brothers, founders of the internationally recognized and renowned  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mayo Clinic  </a> </u>  in Rochester, NY.</p><h3> While I certainly knew the name and the clinic, I was unaware of the brothers&rsquo; unique outlook on life&mdash;and money.</h3><p> <br/> Considering the amount of wealth the two accumulated over the course of their lifetimes, it would be easy to assume they were focused on gaining assets. <strong>  In fact, the opposite is true. </strong> Instead, William Mayo posed an intriguing question in a speech when he and his brother Charles presented a sizeable endowment to the University of Minnesota in 1913. That question wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;how can we drive greater profits&rdquo; or &ldquo;how can we create a stronger brand.&rdquo; <strong>  Instead, his speech was rooted in a simple question: &ldquo;How much do we really need?&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quote from his speech that Mitch Anthony included in his wonderful article  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fa-mag.com/news/drawing-a-line-on--enough-24352.html?issue=258\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Drawing A Line On &lsquo;Enough&rsquo;  </a> </u> :</p><p> &ldquo;Contented industry is the mainspring of human happiness. Money is so likely to encourage waste of time, changing of objectives in life, living under circumstances which put one out of touch with those who have been lifelong friends, who perhaps have been less fortunate. How many families have we seen ruined by money, which has taken away from the younger members the desire to labor and achieve and has introduced elements into their lives whereby, instead of being useful citizens, they have become wasteful and sometimes profligate.&rdquo;</p><p> Like the author, I&rsquo;m struck by the parallel between what the Mayo brothers were seeing more than 100 years ago and the attitudes of many of today&rsquo;s pre- and post-retirees who &ldquo;have arrived&rdquo; into wealth. When our society is so focused on saving money to support lives of leisure, is it any wonder that so many people find it difficult to be truly happy, regardless of their level of wealth? I wonder how much happier we would all be if we put the same level of energy and focus on finding our own &ldquo;contented industry&rdquo; and living a life of purpose&mdash;both before and afterretirement&mdash;as we do on counting the dollars we have to support our leisure time.</p><h3> It may sound like a lofty idea, but as a financial advisor, I see how much this shift in perspective can affect our happiness every day. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Maria called me in crisis. </strong> Her husband quit his job&mdash;again&mdash;and she&rsquo;s in a panic. &ldquo;We need his income, but every time he decides a company isn&rsquo;t right for him, he&rsquo;s out of work for months. How can we pay our bills?&rdquo; Clearly, Maria isn&rsquo;t going to change her husband&rsquo;s behavior. She has a high-paying job as a marketing executive, and she&rsquo;s been with the company for years. Do they have enough to be financially secure and support their family? As their advisor, I believe they do&mdash;even without a second paycheck. It may be time for Maria and her husband to discuss what they can do to &ldquo;right size&rdquo; their lifestyle to match their financial reality. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Chris just turned 66, but she can&rsquo;t even conceive of retirement. </strong> She loves what she does, and she&rsquo;s a great example of someone who is really living a life of purpose. She doesn&rsquo;t work to make money. Instead, she does something that makes her happy, and the money she needs flows from that work. When we discuss future planning, she&rsquo;s happy to know she has the freedom to slow down and only accept jobs with people she likes&mdash;and jobs that aren&rsquo;t a traffic-jam away.

She has just transitioned to palliative care, and she and her husband Dennis are planning a quick trip from their home in Tennessee to Florida where, as her husband says, &ldquo;she is always happiest in the sunshine and warm breezes.&rdquo; I spoke to Sandy and Dennis yesterday, and they are facing this reality with grace. They laughingly said to me &ldquo;we saved too much&hellip;we didn&rsquo;t take enough vacations!&rdquo; Of course, no one plans on an early death, so saving was important, but in my eyes they&rsquo;ve both always had what they really needed: they focused on living life with purpose&mdash;even when their bank accounts were overflowing. <br/>  </li><h3> When it comes to having what we really need, perspective is everything.</h3><p> <br/> Every time I&rsquo;m feeling stressed or down I find joy by driving down the highway, walking at the beach, or dining at a restaurant with a view of the gorgeous Laguna Beach coast.

And while I&rsquo;m not living in one of the mansions on the beach, I love that I get to spend every day helping others.

{"original_id":4182,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Great Impact of Humble Leadership","link":"the-great-impact-of-humble-leadership","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It's very interesting that there are still a lot of leaders who still choose to do the mundane things that are supposed to be done by their paid workers. These CEOs do not just think about the future of the company, but they are also hands-on when it comes to everyday tasks in the office.</p><p> Not all leaders are ready to put aside their ego. But when you do so, so many good things may happen. Below are just a few of the many reasons you can help improve your company's performance by being a humble leader.</p><h3> <strong>  Being humble enables you to hire great employees. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many business leaders are actually egotistical and outspoken. For job searchers, this kind of leader is very easy to spot, especially during the interview process. On the other hand, potential employees tend to get excited by a leader who is not overflowing with ego. Many people would also love to work with a leader who gets involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. When you're a humble leader, you won't find it hard to attract good talent when it's hiring time.</p><h3> <strong>  Being a humble leader will help you retain employees. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you are able to put your ego aside and give your employees freedom and authority to make decisions, you are likely to have employees who are invested and engaged. If you present yourself as a know-it-all guy and you expect perfection from your workers, these behaviors of yours can make your employees feel degraded. Keep in mind that salary alone cannot guarantee job satisfaction among your workers. The things that make employees stay in their jobs are job autonomy, company values, workplace culture, and of course, good leadership.</p><h3> <strong>  Being humble gives you perspective. </strong></h3><p> <br/> It's very common for business leaders to start offloading responsibility when they become successful. Doing this, however, may cause you to lose perspective. It's possible that you'll forget how tough the day-to-day tasks of your employees are, while putting so much importance on the achievement of your goals for the company.</p><p> On the other hand, if you remain physically involved in the business operation, it will be easier for you to know what your employees are struggling with, so you can figure out ways to help them overcome their problems.</p><h3> <strong>  Being humble makes you a respectable leader. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Respect is one of the hardest things to receive. You have to earn it. As someone in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.promentoringinc.com/mentor-program-details/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   leadership position  </a> </u> , you can get the respect of your team if you know how to accept criticisms or feedback. You need to be open-minded about what they will say about your character and performance as a leader. But listening is not enough. More importantly, you should do something about it. If change needs to be made, you have to be ready to do it. All these won't become a problem if you are humble. Without pride getting in the way, you will be more than able to listen to your subordinates and consider the changes they want to happen.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 15:04:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 15:04:34.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_bKE8rHa.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-great-impact-of-humble-leadership/\", \"post_id\": \"9133\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 15:04:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 15:04:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-great-impact-of-humble-leadership\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9132\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4342\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Great-Impact-of-Humble-Leadership.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"963\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455120000,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4183,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"GDP: There Are Positives Moving Forward","link":"gdp-there-are-positives-moving-forward","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  The most recent GDP estimate for the 4th quarter of 2015 came in at 0.7%, a tenth weaker than the 0.8% expected. </strong> If you missed the full report or would like to dig into the details, endless data is available at Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p><p> Fixed Income Academy&rsquo;s Chief Economist, David Horner, Ph.D., believes the components suggest that although growth will remain subdued, it is likely to increase gradually as 2016 progresses. On balance, he expects growth in the first quarter to be near 1.5% and expects it to revert to the 2 percent area for the remaining three quarters, while the risk in the second quarter is a bit to the downside; the risk to the second half is a bit to the upside.</p><p> Because we encourage Academy students and fixed income professionals to understand the inputs behind any forecast to form their own opinions, David also points out the factors to watch in the near term. We feel reviewing the positive and negative inputs to GDP would help anyone interested in bonds, given its strong correlation between the economic recovery, inflation and interest rates.</p><h3> <strong>  The positives going forward are: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Inventory reductions </strong> subtracted 0.45 percentage points from growth following a 0.71% reduction in the third quarter. Inventory levels appear to be well contained and should not be a drag in 2016. </li><li> <strong>  Although the consumer contributed less growth </strong> , 1.46 percentage points in the fourth quarter than in the third, 2.04 and second, 2.42 quarters, household balance sheets appear in good shape with employment gains continuing and lower gas prices increasing real purchasing power. Thus, I expect the growth contribution in the first half to be above the fourth quarter and contribute 2 percentage points to growth.</li><li> <strong>  Residential housing </strong> will likely contribute a quarter point to growth, and</li><li> <strong>  Because fiscal policy is looser </strong> , the Federal government will likely contribute at least a quarter point to growth. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  However, there are weaknesses: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Investment spending </strong> , which subtracted 0.24 percentage points from growth in the fourth quarter, will probably be negative in the first quarter. Investment in energy and mining will continue to erode.</li><li> <strong>  The strong dollar </strong> and slow overseas growth will continue to undermine net exports. However, I expect aggressive monetary policies from our trading partners will gradually limit the downside as the year progresses. Moreover, I do not look for the dollar to strengthen as fast as it did in 2014 and 2015. Nevertheless the lagged effect of the strong dollar will probably subtract a quarter to as much as a half a percentage point to growth in the first half. <br/>  </li><p> Of course, when forecasting economic recoveries, it is always critical to keep an eye on employment. Rising employment has underpinned moderate growth since the 2008-2009 financial crisis and subsequent recession. David also expects continued employment gains, but at a somewhat lower level than the 200,000 plus average of the past several years. Although employment gains fuel growth, actual jobs are a bit of a lagging indicator of growth and the recent growth slowdown will likely cut into the number of new jobs for several months.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 15:16:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 15:16:28.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_nn5An9i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/gdp-there-are-positives-moving-forward/\", \"post_id\": \"9134\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 15:16:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 15:16:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"gdp-there-are-positives-moving-forward\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9132\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4343\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Great-Impact-of-Humble-Leadership.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"539\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455115500,"author_id":463,"chart_url":""}

Post-Game Press Interviews: Youth vs. Experience Showdown </strong></h3><p> <br/> Not uncommon for the NFL players and coaches to be immediately bombarded by the sideline reporters approaching them for comments and questions following the end of the game, this year the CBS sideline reporter couldn&rsquo;t seem to ask Peyton Manning fast enough if he was going to ride off in the sunset and finishing his career with a story book ending following the Broncos Super Bowl win last night. No stranger to these types of situations, and after having weeks to prepare his answer on how he would address the big retirement question with the media, Peyton flawlessly delivered his answer by stating that he was going to focus on enjoying the moment and win with his family and teammates along with stating that he was going to drink a lot of beer and wait until the emotion of the moment passed to evaluate things and where he was at.</p><p> In more exact words, Peyton said:  <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take some time to reflect. I&rsquo;ve got a couple of priorities first. I want to go kiss my wife and my kids. I want to go hug my family. I&rsquo;m going to drink a lot of Budweiser tonight, I promise you that.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> In true champion form both on and off the field, we saw Peyton not only use good judgement for making his retirement decision, but also address the media with class, humility and all the additional great qualities that have made him a leader with his teammates on the field and in the locker room.</p><p> On the other hand, this season we have seen young, flashy Carolina Panthers Quarterback Cameron Newton dazzle fans and media reporters throughout the year, but after winning the 2015 NFL MVP of the League just a couple of nights ago, what we saw unfold in his post-game press conference on Super Bowl Sunday was not at all what sports media reporters and many others expected.</p><p> Attending the post-game press conference with his hoodie pulled over his head and in a sulking demeanor, it was apparent from the get-go that Cam didn&rsquo;t want to be there any more than the rest of his teammates did who were getting drilled with questions by the reporters. Answering the media&rsquo;s question with one word or very short responses, about 2:30 (two minutes and thirty seconds) into his press conference Cam abruptly said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done&rdquo; and got up and walked out.</p><p> Even though videos have surfaced with audio of a Denver Broncos fan heckling Cam in the background of his press conference, many believe that Cam could&rsquo;ve handled his press conference in a more professional manner than he did.</p><p> We understand that athletes addressing the media after a tough loss is one of the hardest parts of their career, but it appeared that Cam let his emotion (and possibly his maturity) get the best of him during his post-game press conference. Now as the new face of the NFL , Cam will be held to a higher standard when it comes to addressing the media like former and current plays do on their toughest days and losses such as other star NFL quarterbacks who have won and loss Super Bowl Championships.</p><p> Former NFL player Deion Sanders now with the NFL Network had this to say about Cam&rsquo;s press conference performance:  <strong>  \"You are the face of our brand right now, you can't do that. I understand the emotions of losing, but you can't do that. A Manning, a Brady ... all these guys who are a prototypical type of quarterback in our game, they're not going to do that ever. Would Drew Brees ever?\" </strong></p><p> Heading into the off-season, there is a lot of work to be done by Cam on improving how he handles addressing the media as he progresses in career and, not to mention, restoring his image and public perception with fans on why he was named the NFL MVP of the 2015 season.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Media Plugs Pay Big for Budweiser </strong></h3><p> <br/> Following #SB50 this year, one of the biggest story headlines from this year&rsquo;s game was not only if Peyton Manning is going to announce his retirement, but also if he was paid by Budweiser to make two nearly seamless and flawless plugs for the brand in his post-game interviews.</p><p> First, on camera with the CBS sideline reporter when explaining how he was going to celebrate the Broncos victory, Peyton said:  <strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to drink a lot of Budweiser tonight, I promise you that.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Shortly after in another post-game interview, he again ended answering a question one of the media reporters had for him by stating:  <strong>  &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to drink a lot of beer tonight. Budweiser.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Quickly taking to twitter after speculation rose on whether or not Peyton is in fact endorsing the brand and if he was paid by Budweiser to mention them, the Head of Marketing Communications for Budweiser tweeted:  <strong>  &ldquo;Hi Internet. For the record, Budweiser did not pay Peyton Manning to mention Budweiser tonight. We were surprised and delighted that he did.&rdquo; </strong>  Lisa Weser</p><p> With many sports business and NFL experts also noting that active NFL players like Peyton can NOT endorse alcohol brands, these subtle mentions by Peyton quickly stirred conversation and rumors that perhaps he will be retiring and this was his first leak of the information to everyone about it with all eyes watching him.</p><p> On the other hand though,  <strong>  Peyton&rsquo;s Budweiser plugs could&rsquo;ve simply have been because he owns two Anheuser-Busch distributors in Louisiana </strong>  and that he was only trying to give the same media love to them as the Papa John&rsquo;s pizza owners he hugged and kissed on tv and of which he owns 21 franchises of in the Denver area.</p><p> At the end of the day, what we learned for a fact is that PR plugs like this PAY BIG TIME for brands with it being reported by Apex MG Analytics that  <strong>  each mention of Budweiser by Peyton on national television was worth $1.6MM for a grand total of $3.2MM worth of free advertising </strong>  exposure being given to Budweiser last night without the exchange of a single dollar between them and Peyton in an endorsement deal.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Marshawn Lynch Takes to twitter to Announce Retirement </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the final quarter of #SB50 in what was turning out to be a fizzling game, Seattle Seahawks Running Back Marshawn Lynch made an appearance on twitter with many seeing a photo he tweeted showing a pair of green cleats hanging from a wire with a peace sign emoji accompanying it. </p><p> Notoriously known from the 2015 Super Bowl Media Day and his statement saying <strong>   &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here so I won&rsquo;t get fined,&rdquo; </strong>  Marshawn was once again showing his ability to make a statement without really having to say anything by implying that he was announcing his retirement via the photo he tweeted.</p><p> In an attempt to either selfishly steal the media spotlight from #SB50 and its players like Peyton and Cam, or in an effort to sweep his announcement under the rug as much as he could so it wouldn&rsquo;t draw nearly as much media attention as it would if it were a slow news day, we once again saw another example of how top professional athletes are utilizing their social media channels to make their own announcements and statements without the help of the media.</p><p> One follower on twitter noted this sly move by Marshawn and said: &ldquo;Marshawn Lynch retiring. Love how he goes out, still doesn't need to say a word #BeastMode #legend&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"mailto:-@ReeceKaralus\">   -@ReeceKaralus  </a> </u></p><p> Shortly followed up by tweets from the official twitter accounts of the Seattle Seahawks and Team Owner, Paul Allen, thanking Marshawn for his career, this left little room for speculation as to whether this was true or not.</p><p> Like many other athletes using and maximizing their social media channels to make big announcements and control messages with the media and fans, this perhaps was one of the first official retirement announcements ever made without even needing words to do so. This has also been said to have been done in true Marshawn fashion who did not want a media circus surrounding him for this announcement, or any other that he made throughout his career.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 15:51:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 15:51:52.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_4N3fbHI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-sports-pr-passing-plays-fumbles-of-super-bowl-50/\", \"post_id\": \"9138\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 15:51:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 15:51:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-sports-pr-passing-plays-fumbles-of-super-bowl-50\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9137\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4346\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Sports-PR-Passing-Plays-Fumbles-of-Super-Bowl-50_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"668\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455134400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

After you&rsquo;ve seen the same infomercial 50 times, you begin to consider it. After another 50 times you think you might actually use it. Another 50 and some of you decide that you&rsquo;ve got to have it &ndash; I mean, heck, they&rsquo;ve run this commercial at least a thousand times, there must be some value to this, right?</p><p> I remember my first sales manager used to say to us that we weren&rsquo;t even in the closing arena until we had asked for the sale at least five times (and gotten a &ldquo;no&rdquo; five times, by the way).

In the meantime, let&rsquo;s go ahead and get the paperwork done and a delivery date set. If they change your mind, you can simply call back in, but in the meantime, you&rsquo;ll have all this completed. Now how would you like to pay for this?&rdquo; (Overcoming the partner objection close)</p><p> <strong>  Close Seven: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Now ________, we can go back and forth on this and I&rsquo;m sure you can come up with many more reasons not to do this &ndash; but let&rsquo;s face it: you know you need it, and I know you want it!

{"original_id":4187,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"This Technology Era Needs Leaders That Fail","link":"this-technology-era-needs-leaders-that-fail","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> 95% of everything changes. Constantly. What is the most fundamental change of this decade?</h3><p> <br/> Probably the blurring lines between functional and theoretical technology. A lot of theories that seemed unattainable in the past, are now being developed into &ndash; sometimes astonishing &ndash; functional designs, smart solutions. The transition time between theory and real life applications is becoming shorter. Our ecosystems are more or less enforcing this evolution to take place and society seems to quickly adopt the new developments that this evolution brings along. But are we able to live up to that accelerating cycle? Will the human capital of our businesses be up to speed in time? No, at this point not yet. We need to drastically modernise our education system, that incorporates the societal and entrepreneurial consequences of this technology era. After all, if the future is about talent, the battlefield will be the schools and universities.</p><p> We need to become as agile as the continuous change. Technology will help us simplify a lot of basic processes in life. It won&rsquo;t take long before the windows in your room will become solar panels and telephones are turning into real time medical devices. Apps can be built on virtually all platforms. We will be able to schedule trains on demand, book taxis real time, easily request a ride share and order your fully briefed painter in a few clicks.</p><p> There is no way back. Some of these technologies are already seen as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; today and are infiltrating in our lives. The latest developments like mainstream  <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/2905415/internet-of-things/upcoming-low-power-chips-will-last-decades-on-a-battery.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  low-power chips </a>  and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/18/microsoft-officially-launches-azure-machine-learning-big-data-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  machine learning in the cloud with Microsoft azure </a>  are examples of such developments that will only move forward. Hyperscale data centers are a fact and keep on growing. Enhancements will keep on changing our daily practise.</p><p> What are the consequences of this evolutionary perspective?</p><h3> <strong>  Innovation blurs the lines between industries </strong></h3><p> <br/> What do you think? Is Apple a technology company or an exclusive watchmaker? And Samsung, a technology company or a medical supplier? Is Google a search-engine company or an upcoming car company manufacturing driverless cars? Today you will probably answer these questions without any hesitation. Within a few years the answers will be doubtful or change completely. I&rsquo;m even wondering what the next generation will have top of mind in relation to these companies.</p><p> Innovation opens doors for organisations enabling them to cross lines. With technology organisations can engage those possibilities due to compatible components that are processable in different devices or solutions. If you have most of the necessary knowledge in house, why not embrace these business opportunities?</p><h3> <strong>  Practise before you preach </strong></h3><p> <br/> These cross border approaches have implications for the way organisations operate. What does this mean for their leaders? These turbulent developments yield an environmental and social context that is uncertain, volatile, and complex; unpredictable forces that create a significant challenge for talent development. <br/> So what do you need to do as a company executive? First step: you go out there. Try. Learn. Fail. Grow. Be the apprentice for a while. Hence, find out what talents need to operate successfully within your organisation, what skills are crucial to your business and its innovative horizons.</p><p> What approach will match talent management and development to this &lsquo;fail-and-learn&rsquo; strategy?</p><h3> <strong>  Grasp talent in an early stage </strong></h3><p> <br/> The talent you hire need to do the same: try, learn, fail and grow. And who aren&rsquo;t scared to do so? Indeed, young people. When will the first corporate hire a 13-year old? Maybe I&rsquo;m more curious about what corporate has the guts to do this. Isn&rsquo;t it strange that with soccer we don&rsquo;t experience this as odd? Manchester United and FC Barcelona are hiring adolescents. Why are corporates so reserved to do this? I don&rsquo;t mean those unofficial work groups you now and then hear about, where children have a careful say in how to deal with certain environmental issues. Really hire them, offer the young talents in house education. You&rsquo;ll be surprised of the fresh outlook they will provide on many subjects.</p><h3> <strong>  Start intensive partnerships with universities </strong></h3><p> <br/> In order to provide adolescents with official education (fully licensed) large corporates should start partnerships with schools and universities. The innovative solution that learning methods are waiting for: alignment of education systems with the demanding criteria of modern society and ecosystems. What if partnerships fail the first time? Learn and try a new strategy that fits in this technology era.</p><p> In this perspective my last question; should we educate our next generation for free so they are granted the space to fail? Any ideas?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 16:07:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 16:07:20.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ilcBLHv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/this-technology-era-needs-leaders-that-fail/\", \"post_id\": \"9142\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 16:07:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 16:07:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"this-technology-era-needs-leaders-that-fail\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9141\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4348\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/This-Technology-Era-Needs-Leaders-That-Fail.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"680\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455111000,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4188,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"14 Reasons People LOVE Their Job","link":"14-reasons-people-love-their-job","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Have a little fun this week with Valentine&rsquo;s Day! Can your employees name 14 things they love about their job?</h3><p> <br/> If so, great! If not, it may be time to look at areas for improvement. Businesses as a whole tend to spend time on client satisfaction surveys, but lack a system to ensure employee satisfaction is favorable.</p><p> Employees are likely to be actively engaged when upper management, including the boss, pays attention to their work, provides tools and resources for the job, listens, and addresses employee concerns.</p><p> Employers tend to assume employees are happy and workplace perks are sufficient. Don&rsquo;t assume! Ask your employees and act on the results.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are 14 reasons people love their job: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1) Co-Workers</h3><p> Relationships with colleagues may be more important than you think. Healthy workplace relationships improve productivity while disconnected relationships contribute to an unengaged team.</p><h3> 2) Passion</h3><p> Employees who are passionate about their career and the company they represent perform at their best. Identify what your team members are passionate about and ensure they are in the position that best suits them.</p><h3> 3) Autonomy, Freedom &amp; Flexibility</h3><p> Provide employees with freedom to ad-lib, create, and innovate.</p><h3> 4) Culture</h3><p> Loving an office culture isn&rsquo;t just about plush furniture and free coffee. Leaders need to provide a commendable culture through example by demonstrating trust and communication. A culture filled with dysfunction, toxicity, and disengaged leaders easily resorts to employee turnover.</p><h3> 5) Learning Opportunities</h3><p> Provide tools, resources, and educational workshops to allow each team member to grow personally and professionally.</p><h3> 6) Challenges</h3><p> Team members need to feel challenged in their position and on a constant path to improve and develop new skills. If challenges are not present, they will feel their position is repetitive and humdrum. Assign duties and provide tools to stretch employee limits.</p><h3> 7) Compensation</h3><p> Employee passion and drive fall short if they feel they are being paid less than they deserve. Consider providing a survey to each team member asking if they feel they are properly compensated. Prepare a survey analysis of each position within your firm and ensure team members fall into the range of acceptable compensation.</p><h3> 8) Benefits </h3><p> Stay in tune with the benefit package you offer and throw in some perks your employees can boast about. To stay competitive, learn what other companies are offering and try to match a few of their ideas.</p><h3> 9) Advancement</h3><p> Providing advancement opportunities to your team is vital. If employees feel stuck in a dead-end career due to the lack of opportunities to advance, they will leave. Create a career plan for each team member and review frequently, even if your company is small.</p><h3> 10) Empowerment</h3><p> Employees thrive when they are empowered to accomplish their goals without a bunch of red tape. If employees aren&rsquo;t allowed to make their own decisions, they will feel they are walking on eggshells. Establish employee autonomy to cultivate productivity and trust levels.</p><h3> 11) Feel Valued</h3><p> Everyone needs to feel valued and believe their contributions play a vital role in company success. Hand out a pat on the back with verbal recognition to acknowledge employee efforts. Monetary rewards or an occasional gift should be tied to exemplary performance.</p><h3> 12) Values</h3><p> Consider asking team members regularly about their values and how they align with the values of your firm. Incorporate this question into your hiring process.</p><h3> 13) Career Syncs with Life</h3><p> Employees are satisfied if their career syncs well with their personal life. Offer flexible schedules and telecommuting to allow team members to take time for personal and family events.</p><h3> 14) My Boss</h3><p> Make certain you practice what you preach.

You&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Of course, I would!&rdquo; Are you really sure though?</p><p> I want to walk you through an exercise today and if you&rsquo;re brutally honest with yourself, you&rsquo;ll love the outcome. If you&rsquo;re not, this will be a complete waste of time, stop reading and go watch a cat video like this  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbP2N1BQdYc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  The Set-Up </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> About three years ago, if you had asked me who my ideal client was, I thought the answer was everyone in financial services. Yep &ndash; I went out and connected to everyone and it was my epic fail moment when I realized at the end of a &ldquo;heavy-duty connecting, talking, selling what I do&rdquo; year &ndash; I still only had a handful of solid clients. How can that be?</p><h3> <strong>  Well, this ain&rsquo;t no Kevin Costner movie </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> All the coaches and gurus tell you the &ldquo;Build it and they will come&rdquo; story. I was so fired up! I was offering services, giving away some stuff, providing value, etc. The passion I have for what I do is almost palatable anyway, yet I can single-handedly tell you the whole Field of Dreams business mantra is crap. You know what I was left saying, &ldquo;Where is everybody?&rdquo;</p><p> <u>  Jim Ash </u> , the founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ashbrokerage.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ash Brokerage  </a> </u> , is someone I greatly admire and respect. Full Disclosure: Yes, I work for Ash Brokerage. Jim has said to me and many others, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll walk by more business than you&rsquo;ll ever write&rdquo; and when I got to the end of my rope that year, I sat reflecting on why I had so few financial service evangelists about social media in those early times. I kept thinking about what Jim said and his words finally hit me&hellip;I&rsquo;m walking by more business than I realize.</p><h3> <strong>  Kapow! </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> I made a decision to only work with certain clients from that point forward: clients I liked, clients who liked me back, and clients who referred others to me. When I sat down and classified all those clients who fit into these categories, sure enough, there was a pattern. Certain traits, niches, etc. came out very clearly. Now, how do I find them online?</p><p> LinkedIn was my go-to source. I quickly categorized and tagged these advisor clients and then I got back to work on finding more folks like them!</p><h3> <strong>  Meet Jo! </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"stickman\" src=\"https://bionicsocialite.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/stickman.png?w=137&amp;h=137\"/></p><p> <strong>  I drew a stick figure and named him Jo. </strong> I kept him gender neutral as my list had the same amount of women and men on it. Jo was a family person, which doesn&rsquo;t mean they had to have kids, but our similarities in being committed to our family were important to both of us. Jo referred me to other people&hellip;like Jo. Jo respected my time on projects and didn&rsquo;t ask for crazy turnaround times. But the most important trait in this exercise: Jo was open to learning a new skill (like social media), took it seriously and made changes. This trait was the most important one of all to bring me personal joy and satisfaction. </p><p> Facebook has been around since 2004. LinkedIn was created in 2002. Google was 1998. This is crazy, right? I don&rsquo;t want to have to convince anyone in 2016 that social media is hip, funky and fresh. It&rsquo;s been around forever. All I needed was for the advisor I work with to be open to learning a new skill, took it seriously and made changes in the same direction I was willing to navigate.</p><p> By defining &ldquo;Jo&rdquo; I now recognize my ideal client more quickly and I&rsquo;m less likely to walk by them as Jim Ash reminds so many of us. You are probably &ldquo;walking by&rdquo; clients online today and not even aware they are your idealclients. This exercise created a turning point for me.</p><p> I would love to hear your comments and ideas. Please reach out and share what practices have worked best for you and let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t emulate this in the online world together.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 16:33:14.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 16:33:14.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_jpKtxGS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/would-you-know-your-ideal-client-if-you-met-them-online/\", \"post_id\": \"9145\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 16:33:14\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 16:33:14\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"would-you-know-your-ideal-client-if-you-met-them-online\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9144\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4350\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14-Reasons-People-LOVE-Their-Job.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"383\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455102000,"author_id":441,"chart_url":""}

There is a systemic issue with these highly important resources that make or break a company&rsquo;s performance.</p><p> Regardless of your company&rsquo;s sales resources needs, it&rsquo;s important to understand there are best recruitment and interviewing techniques to help secure any long-term successful employee.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve addressed these techniques separately in  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/books/the-hiring-prophecies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Hiring Prophecies: Psychology behind Recruiting Successful Employees  </a> </u> . That book will help you understand and implement a successful recruitment structure irrespective of your particular resource needs.</p><h3> <strong>  Why is it so difficult to hire high performing sales executives? </strong></h3><p> <br/> When it comes to sales executives, however, there is an extra layer of difficulty. In this guide, I&rsquo;ll share why that&rsquo;s the case and techniques to improve your success rate.</p><p> The reason is simple&mdash;it&rsquo;s so difficult because it&rsquo;s a shade below impossible to simulate their future performance in your organization regardless of their past performance.</p><p> This is true in the most extended interviewing processes, but a virtual certainty in condensed ones. This issue is further exacerbated because many sales people are articulate (even if not strong in critical reasoning) and their eloquence masks their efficacy to an untrained interviewer.</p><h3> <strong>  What can you do to improve your success rate when hiring sales executives? </strong></h3><p> <br/> They&rsquo;re smart! They&rsquo;re articulate! They look good! That&rsquo;s what you see above the surface. You need to examine who they truly are.</p><p> Simply because they&rsquo;ve been successful elsewhere and have a wonderful network of business colleagues and friends doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re your answer. Perhaps they were selling a household-named product. Perhaps they scored it big with a customer who blindly kept buying. Who knows?</p><p> To effectively assess them, you need to look at their history and project their future.</p><p> Most interviewers take a look at history in this manner, &ldquo;Walk me through your most (or least) successful sale? Take me through it step by step so I can get an understanding of your sales techniques.&rdquo;</p><p> This is helpful in some regard, but you&rsquo;re turning control of the interview over to the sales candidates and also allowing them to explain something they&rsquo;ve likely crafted to perfection. I suggest augmenting questions such as those with what I like to call &ldquo;looking under the sales iceberg.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Look Under the Iceberg! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Thousands of evaluations have shown me there are eight major areas to evaluate (only as a starting point) to ensure the sales person can actually sell. That means a-c-t-u-a-l-l-y sell.</p><p> It doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;who they know&rdquo; or &ldquo;how they sound&rdquo; or &ldquo;how they look.&rdquo;</p><p> While understanding these eight areas alone won&rsquo;t provide the entire picture, it will offer significant evidence of their historical achievements as well as insight into how they will likely perform:</p><li> <strong>  Products &amp; Services. </strong>  What do they sell&mdash;is it a product, a service, or other?</li><li> <strong>  Target Buyer &amp; Companies. </strong>  To whom do they sell&mdash;target buyers and target companies?</li><li> <strong>  Techniques. </strong> How do they sell it&mdash;warm calls, cold calls, consultative selling, and/or transactional selling?</li><li> <strong>  Lead Generation &amp; Qualification.  </strong> How do they identify and gather leads? Do they do their own research? Do they leverage marketing channels, campaigns, target lists, and so on?</li><li> <strong>  Involvement. </strong> Understand their involvement in the sales process. Where do they start and finish in the process?</li><li> <strong>  Follow Up &amp; Tools. </strong> What follow up tools and techniques do they use? What sales training and methodologies do they use?</li><li> <strong>  Quota Management, Achievement, &amp; Distribution. </strong>  Do they have a quota? What are their actual achievements against their target quota (for the last few years)? How was their revenue achieved (i.e., customer distribution, new customers, old customers, percentages for new and old, and so forth)?</li><li> <strong>  Communication &amp; Presence. </strong> How well do they communicate? How effective is their logic? Are they presentable? Do they listen well? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Simulate the future! </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now that you have a sense of their history, it&rsquo;s important to evaluate how they&rsquo;ll likely perform.</p><p> My first suggestion is to avoid the typical Critical Behavior Interview (CBI) questions as a method to assess past behavior as a predictor of future behavior. We&rsquo;re not looking for future behaviors&mdash;we are looking for future results!</p><p> The best way to evaluate future results is to simulate the future they are most likely to encounter in your environment. You know this best. After all, it&rsquo;s your company.</p><p> Why not put them in real live situations you&rsquo;ve recently encountered and ask them what they would do? How would they handle this particular scenario? What would they say? How would they resolve the issue? How would they develop the strategy?</p><p> This might sound obvious, but most companies completely ignore the most predictive criteria in favor of what the candidate did in the past.</p><p> The most effective interviewing processes, and therefore the ones that lead to the greatest long-term results, are those that look at three major facets of time&mdash;the candidate&rsquo;s past (achievements), their present (current knowledge, skill base), and future (simulations of real-life situations they&rsquo;re virtually certain to encounter).</p><p> For much more information on how to conduct these interviews, check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/books/the-hiring-prophecies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Hiring Prophecies: Psychology behind Recruiting Successful Employees  </a> </u> .</p><p> To download this content AND a great checklist of specific questions, click the picture!</p><p> <a href=\"https://milewalk.leadpages.co/leadbox/127904133f72a2%3A17fd80be1346dc/5743444345487360/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://milewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Employers-Guide-to-Interview-Sales-Executives-1-2016-v1-300x300.png\"/> </a></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 16:38:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 16:38:22.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ATRRBik.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/8-critical-musts-in-hiring-sales-executives/\", \"post_id\": \"9147\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 16:38:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 16:38:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"8-critical-musts-in-hiring-sales-executives\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9146\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4351\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/8-Critical-Musts-in-Hiring-Sales-Executives.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"393\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455174000,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}

The size of its middle class is rapidly expanding in size, giving a huge boost to domestic consumption. And with the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the renminbi&rsquo;s inclusion in the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s (IMF) reserve currency, China&rsquo;s role in global financial markets is growing in importance.</p><p> No one can deny that challenges lie ahead, but opportunities are still abundant.</p><p> With this in mind, I&rsquo;ve put together 10 figures to know as China enters a new year.</p><h3> <strong>  9th </strong></h3><p> <br/> As the ninth animal in China&rsquo;s 12-zodiac cycle, the monkey is considered confident, curious and a great problem-solver.

Not only are younger Chinese citizens spending more than ever before, they&rsquo;re doing it more frequently, as e-commerce allows for convenient around-the-clock spending.

The country certainly retained the title last year, selling 24.6 million vehicles, an increase of 4.7 percent over 2014. The U.S., by comparison, sold 17.2 million.

There&rsquo;s no denying that its economy is in transition, evidenced by the government&rsquo;s 2016 growth range of between 6.5 and 7 percent, a demotion from 2015&rsquo;s target of 7 percent.

{"original_id":4192,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Building Client Relationships In a Downturn","link":"building-client-relationships-in-a-downturn","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Ironically, the devastation wrought by World War II created the circumstances for many positive and creative changes around the world, once the conflict was over.</h3>The Marshall Plan, which helped modernize Europe, emerged in the war&rsquo;s aftermath; the United Nations was created; new and stronger democracies came into being; new technologies were adopted into civilian markets; Germany, Japan, and the US turned their industrial energies towards private sector economic growth; and so on. Similarly, I believe the current economic crisis can be a powerful catalyst for developing new and better client relationships and for personal renewal.<strong> I&rsquo;ll get right to the point: If you&rsquo;d like to revitalize your client relationships and re-engage with the marketplace, here is a list of seven actions you should initiate in the next 30 days. I list them in order of relative urgency.</strong><h3> 1. Make a list of your 15-25 core relationships.</h3>These should include current clients (list individuals), prospective clients, colleagues,catalysts (influencers, people who can make deals happen and introduce you to others), collaborators (professionals or firms that you may collaborate with and exchange leads with), and counselors (mentors and advisors to you).My research shows that relationships with individuals representing a broad spectrum of roles (including non-clients such as colleagues, catalysts, etc) are essential to success with clients. Start this process with a list of these critical few&ndash;of your most important relationships, in other words, not a database of 500 people you may have met.<h3> 2. Identify a next step to create face time with each person on your list.</h3>There are endless reasons to get in touch. You could follow up on a project that was done last year. You could develop a point of view on an issue of importance to that individual. You could offer a valuable introduction. You could ask thoughtful questions about how their company is managing through the economic crisis, and share some of the things your other clients are doing.I like to think about four ways you can add value during these short interactions: Offering ideas and perspectives (content); Making valuable introductions (connection); Offering personal help (e.g., career counseling, advice to a teenager about college or career choices, etc.); and having fun (going to a sporting event or concert).<h3> 3. Next, create a one-page, personal Sales Funnel.</h3><strong> Put all of your current client opportunities in three categories:</strong>Category A should represent initial conversations you have had or are having about an identified issue (there might be a number of these preliminary leads).More developed discussions would be under the B category. For these, you&rsquo;ve met the client several times, a clear issue is on the table, and you&rsquo;ve discussed an approach and possible fees. C&rsquo;s are submitted proposals.Pick your three best opportunities&ndash;ones you can still influence, which will probably be from the A or B categories&mdash;and really work these with your colleagues. Leave no stone unturned. Have a highly experienced colleague review what you&sup1;ve done so far and make suggestions. Make sure you&rsquo;ve identified and met with all key buying influences (economic buyer, work-with buyer, influencers, procurement, etc.), and that you have a coach. Ensure that you&rsquo;ve pinpointed which are the most valuable benefits for the client. Make a list of possible barriers to each sale, and brainstorm how you will overcome them.<h3> 4. Now, turn to your core clients (some of the opportunities in 3 could be with core clients&ndash;that&rsquo;s fine&ndash;I&rsquo;m trying to sequence my recommendations into immediate, short-term, and medium-term actions). Pick one as a model.</h3>Now, make a list of ways in which you could re-engage and revitalize this relationship. I would focus on the following questions or issues:<li> <strong>  How well do you really know this client, the industry, and the overall environment it is working within? </strong> What knowledge gaps should you be filling?</li><li> <strong>  What is this client&rsquo;s &ldquo;Agenda&rdquo;? </strong>   By Agenda I mean the company&rsquo;s 4-5 most critical priorities and goals. What is your individual client&rsquo;s Agenda? What business issues is he or she focused on right now? What personal issues are of concern? (e.g., retiring and leaving a legacy; getting promoted; keeping their job; etc.).</li><li> <strong>  What pain-points or critical issues could you help them address? </strong> How can you showcase your firm&rsquo;s capabilities to them and build trust in your ability to solve their issues? Do you have a &ldquo;branded expert&rdquo; colleague that you could introduce? Another client you could have them talk to?</li><li> <strong>  Is there an opportunity, due to slack capacity, to do a free piece of work for this client, in an area of critical interest? </strong> Or, at least, to invest in developing a thought piece or set of recommendations around a particular issue?</li><li> <strong>  Given the turmoil, is there an opportunity to create a different &ldquo;relationship experience environment&rdquo; for this client? </strong> For example, to: Take them offsite? Create a workshop experience to look at previously unthinkable options? Create a forum for them to meet some other like-minded clients and engage in peer-to-peer sharing? Use collaboration technology to connect with them?</li><li> <strong>  Does each member of your team have clear relationship-building responsibilities with this client? </strong> Are you building many-to-many relationships, at multiple levels?</li><li> <strong>  Do you have a well thought-out account plan for this client? </strong></li><h3> 5. You&rsquo;ve now dealt with the short and medium term.</h3>You&rsquo;re getting more face time with your 15 or 20 most important relationships; you&rsquo;ve done everything possible to maximize your best near-term sales opportunities; and you&rsquo;ve refocused on growing your core clients.<strong> Now, let&rsquo;s think about the next 12 months. What can you do today to make sure you have a robust leadstream in the second half of the year?</strong><strong> Think about this:</strong>There are probably fewer opportunities out in the market right now, and your average success rate for turning one of them into a concrete proposal&ndash;and winning that proposal&mdash;is probably less than it was a year ago. So you simply have to get sight of more opportunities&lsaquo;otherwise, your revenues will plummet. Start by identifying 3 or 4 &ldquo;traffic building&rdquo; activities that you can commit to. These can include publishing and speaking; professional association involvement; industry networking; social networking; working with collaborators (a bank or law firm or private equity firm); developing a new service offering; and so on.<strong> The list is endless.</strong>What activities, in short, will help reinforce your professional credentials and expertise while getting you in front of potential clients or people who can refer clients to you? Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re going to do 20 things in the next six months. Rather, pick a few, write them down, and follow through.<h3> 6. Think about how to use the coming months to &ldquo;sharpen the saw&rdquo;&ndash;to deepen your current skills, develop new ones, and increase your effectiveness as a professional and as a client advisor.</h3>The latest research shows that most people don&rsquo;t really learn from experience&ndash;in fact, more experience can actually make you worse at your job (if you don&rsquo;t believe me, read Geoff Colvin&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842948/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455037681&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=talent+is+overrated+by+geoff+colvin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Talent Is Overrated </u></a>&rdquo;). This is because we don&rsquo;t engage in what scientists call Deliberate Practice. We don&rsquo;t really work at the specific things that will make us better&ndash;rather, we show up and do the same activities over and over again without getting better. Write down just a few things you&rsquo;d like to work on.Maybe it&rsquo;s extending your experience to a new field or practice area. Perhaps this year you&rsquo;d like to get your Myers-Briggs certification, take a leadership role in an industry conference, or spend a month in one of your firm&rsquo;s international offices working on a project.  Or to go to that weekend photography workshop (or meditation retreat you&rsquo;ve been eyeing&hellip;).<h3> 7. In everything you do this year, collaborate more than ever.</h3>Work to connect with your colleagues and friends. At the signing of the American Declaration of Independence, the sage Ben Franklin said,<strong> &ldquo;We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.&rdquo;</strong>This certainly applies to today&rsquo;s economic crisis.You may feel stymied because some clients are cutting back and saying they have no budget right now. But a client in need can be a great client indeed. You simply have to be more creative than usual about the different ways you can help your clients, bold about offering that help, and flexible in how you&rsquo;re willing to structure and deliver it.<strong> Finally, sit back and breathe. 2016 won&rsquo;t be easy.</strong>But for sure, it will carry surprises for each one of us&ndash;and I believe some of those will be very positive ones.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 17:02:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 17:02:02.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_t99usgz.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/building-client-relationships-in-a-downturn/\", \"post_id\": \"9151\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 17:02:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 17:02:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"building-client-relationships-in-a-downturn\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9150\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4353\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Building-Client-Relationships-In-a-Downturn.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"486\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455174600,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

That makes this the most costly chronic health condition in the United States today.</p><p> Cause(s): Research has shown that some of the primary causes of heart disease include smoking, as well as second hand smoke. Some other key factors can include high amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood, as well as having high blood pressure.</p><p> How to Help: Some ways to help in managing or controlling this condition can be eating lots of fruits and vegetables, along with foods that are high in fiber. Those who may be prone to this condition should also avoid foods that are high in saturated fat and cholesterol.

The good news is that over the past decade, cancer death rates have been declining.</p><p> Cause(s): It is thought that gene mutations are the primary cause of cancer. Most gene mutations occur after a person is born. There are many different entities that can cause a gene mutation, including radiation, smoking, and certain viruses, as well as cancer-causing chemicals, hormones, and even a lack of exercise.</p><p> How to Help: In order to lower the risk of certain types of cancer, it is recommended that individuals avoid smoking, and to cut back on the consumption of alcohol. In addition, sticking to a healthy diet and exercising can be helpful. If out in the sun for long periods of time, wearing sunscreen is also recommended.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/cancer/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn about getting life insurance with cancer  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Cognitive Conditions / Mental Disorders </strong></h3><p> Cost: $57.5 billion</p><p> Although many people may think that mental disorders are rare, the truth is that they are a lot more common than you might imagine. The reality is that more than one in four adults suffers from some type of a cognitive disorder.</p><p> Cause(s): It is not known what causes these types of disorders. However, it is thought that they could be caused by a combination of biological, genetic, psychological, and even environmental factors.</p><p> How to Help: It is important to ensure that you know the warning signs so that you can get the help that a loved one may need.

Those who have asthma may have inherited it, as it tends to be hereditary.</p><p> How to Help: In order to help with COPD, quitting smoking is the best way, if this is applicable. Also, staying away from dusty and / or polluted areas is another. For the control of asthma attacks, it is best to avoid any triggers that you may have, and to take any medications that your doctor has prescribed.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/high-risk-life-insurance/asthma/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Learn about life insurance with asthma  </u>  . </a></p><h3> <strong>  Joint Disorders </strong></h3><p> Cost: $80.8 billion</p><p> There are many different types of joint disorders that can befall someone throughout their lifetime. Yet, as you get older, these can tend to become even more of a chronic &ndash; and costly &ndash; condition.</p><p> Cause(s): As people age, they are more apt to develop issues with their joints. One of the most common issues in this area is osteoarthritis, or OA, which is a leading cause of hip and knee replacements.</p><p> How to Help: Losing weight can help to lower the chances of osteoarthritis. Also, doing lower-impact exercises such as bicycling and swimming can help to keep joints active without causing pain.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/high-risk-life-insurance/arthritis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn about life insurance with arthritis.  </a> </u></p><h3> <strong>  Caregiving Can Be Costly Too </strong></h3><p> <br/> In addition to having a chronic health condition, being a care provider for someone who is ill can also be quite costly. It is estimated that there are more than 40 million people in the United States who provide care for another individual.</p><p> These caregivers pay roughly $200 per month from their own pockets in order to subsidize the care they provide &ndash; and, with an average of more than four years of providing that care, these expenses can really add up.</p><p> Caregivers can also lose out financially in other ways, too. For example, according to Met Life&rsquo;s Study of Caregiving Costs to Working Caregivers, males who leave the workforce early or reduce their work hours to care for a loved one lose an average of over $89,000 in cumulative wages. Over time, this can equate to a loss in Social Security benefits of more than $144,000.</p><p> Females can also lose quite a bit financially when it comes to providing care for someone else. With an estimated loss in wages of approximately $142,700 combined with a loss in Social Security benefits of roughly $131,350 as well as a loss of an additional $50,000 in retirement savings, the average loss financially for women can be more than $324,000 in total.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/long-term-care-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Learn about ways to pay for long term care costs.  </a> </u></p><h3> <strong>  The Caregiving Financial Solution </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the best ways to help in covering the financial impact of a potential long-term care need is to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/long-term-care-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purchase long term care insurance  </a> </u> . These policies cover a variety of different needs, including care in a facility, as well as care in the recipient&rsquo;s own home.</p><p> Today, many long-term care insurance policies will also provide a certain amount of benefits to cover at least some of the costs that an informal caregiver incurs. This can be the case, even if the individual is not a paid professional such as an RN or an LPN.</p><p> It is important that long-term care insurance be purchased while a person is still healthy enough to qualify. Therefore, looking into coverage early can help to ensure better coverage options, as well as lower premium cost.</p><p> In order to determine what your options may be for a long-term care insurance plan, talk to us.

Is management still dependent on just a few people at the top?</h3>Leading companies across the globe are ditching  traditional, bureaucratic management styles for something called Holacracy. This system scraps the management hierarchy policy and replaces it with a modern corporate democracy. But, how are these companies succeeding? What are the pros and cons of this new system?First, it&rsquo;s important to define what<u> <a href=\"http://www.holacracy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Holacracy </a></u>is. Brian Robertson&rsquo;s, the brain child of this system, objective was to find a solution to what he saw as barriers to productivity, creativity and transparency. He decided to create HolacracyOne, a consulting company that offers training for companies that want to implement the system. Holacracy attempts to rethink organizational management structures.What Holacracy offers is one of the most structured methods for achieving this goal and, unlike other systems, it does not promote a completely flat hierarchy, making it less radical than what skeptics might have you believe. With this system, employees no longer take job titles. Instead they inhabit roles that create autonomy over their work.<h3> <strong>  Restructuring </strong></h3>According to<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Jaques\" target=\"_blank\"> Elliot Jaques</a>, an organizational theorist, there are three types of structures in a company. A &ldquo;Formal Structure&rdquo; is the organisations charts and job descriptions, which are  out of date and irrelevant when it comes to clarity on what the focus should be or what to expect from others.  &ldquo;Extant structure&rdquo; is an indication of the way things are done and what is actually operating. Then there is the &ldquo;requisite structure&rdquo;, what the company actually wants their structure to be like. According to<u> <a href=\"http://www.holacracy.org/holacracyone\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brian Robertson </a></u>,  there is a tension gap between what it is and what could be. He<u> <a href=\"https://blog.holacracy.org/whats-wrong-with-your-organizational-structure-91dd71a76eb7#.b3iue1mg7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  believes </a></u>that in a Holacracy focused organization, people do refer to their and others&rsquo; job descriptions regularly, sometimes on a daily basis&mdash;because they contain relevant, accurate, and useful clarity on what makes sense to do and expect. As a result, three structures collapse and become one.<u> <a href=\"http://gettingthingsdone.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Getting Things Done </a></u>is an example of that phenomenon, David Allen, CEO of the company reorganized it using Holacracy. Originally, they were structured as departments. According to David, &ldquo;Over several months, it became clear that some natural value streams within  company were getting clogged up because of how they were structured. Work was not flowing. It was ping-ponging off the different departments.We restructured our organization into three value streams with a clear customer at the end of each. We now use the structure to help push work through the value streams to get to the customer with fewer handoffs and touch points. Before, we had questions on who has authority on the profit and loss; now it is crystal clear.&rdquo;<u> <a href=\"http://www.precisionnutrition.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Precision Nutrition </a></u>, a multidisciplinary team of coaches for companies, adopted Holacracy when the company was growing 50% every year. The company adopted Holacracy to provide leadership throughout the organization, not in the managerial sense but to give people a say in the governance and strategic meetings. Phil Caravaggio says that the hardest part was to make the mental shift. In this<u> <a href=\"http://www.holacracy.org/precision-nutrition/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  article </a></u> Phil sustains &ldquo;Other people are going to have genuine authority. They will be the authority, not me, on X, Y or Z. I will be subservient to them in these various functions.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;Just letting go of entire chunks of the organization and allowing other extremely capable people to take that on is the hardest thing to do. It sounds trivial because it&rsquo;s something that I think you&rsquo;d imagine every organization has to face as it grows. But in some organizations, they really don&rsquo;t face it.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Enhancing Feedback </strong></h3>Not all companies adopt Holacracy as a whole, many of them implemented the system in different aspects of daily work. When it comes to feedback, leading companies such as GE, Accenture, Adobe, realised that feedback between peers and upward feedback was more than necessary in order to  boost productivity, rather than annual performance reviews. That&rsquo;s why many of them started adopting real-time<u> <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/technology/pages/employee-feedback-apps.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  feedback tools </a></u>such as<a href=\"http://www.impraise.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Impraise,</a>  in order to empower everyone in  the company to provide real-time feedback in cost-beneficial way.Medium, the online-publishing startup led by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams,<u> <a href=\"http://firstround.com/review/How-Medium-is-building-a-new-kind-of-company-with-no-managers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  has been using Holacracy for 2 years now </a></u>. When it comes to feedback at work, they found that one of the system&rsquo;s shortcomings was the lack of a mechanism for giving praise or feedback to employees, a task traditionally carried out by managers. To solve this problem, they utilized the system&rsquo;s fast iteration process to simply create a new roles called &ldquo;Group Leads&rdquo; with the specific purpose of administering feedback to employees.Blinkist, after adopting Holacracy, got rid of managers in the traditional sense of who will oversee work and keep up with workers&rsquo; progress. &ldquo;For example, instead of a manager giving feedback, the group gives feedback to every team member by raising tensions in a weekly tactical meetings&rdquo; says Niklas Jansen, Co-Founder of the company.<h3> <strong>  Critics to Holacracy  </strong></h3>Onboarding employees to a brand new type of work culture when there is no hierarchy,  represents a challenge for any company. Zappos, famous for offering new employees money to leave the company, saw an<a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/zappos-makes-satirical-video-about-holacracy-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> incrementation of 1% to 14% of employees opting to leave</a>the company when offered several months&rsquo; severance pay to leave because they were not embracing what was happening. Steve Denning in his<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/05/23/is-holacracy-succeeding-at-zappos/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  article </u></a>makes a valid question, &ldquo;It would thus be interesting to know how many of the 14% who have just opted to leave Zappos have left, not because of the failure to embrace self-empowerment, but because they were concerned at the apparent complexity of the processes being introduced.&rdquo; Employees have noted that the transition has been rocky. &ldquo;It is really painful and slow at first&rdquo; Christa Foley, a Zappos employee for 10 years , told the Times.According to a Forbes<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurareston/2015/07/17/tony-hsiehs-workplace-dream-is-holacracy-a-big-failure/\" target=\"_blank\"> article</a>about Holacracy complications, the irony is that holacracy is supposed to be a great leveler, tearing down red tape and formal bureaucracy that supposedly stymie creativity. And yet to make it work, holacracists have to attend hours of regimented meetings conducted with a procedural formality that seems antithetical to the original freewheeling intent.In Zappos critics to Holacracy are split between those who feel comfortable working under this original type of management and others who are<u> <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/08/04/my-company-adopted-a-holacracy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  criticising it for being too rigid and dogmatic </a></u>. <u> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-zappos-banishing-the-bosses-brings-confusion-1432175402\" target=\"_blank\">  A </a> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-zappos-banishing-the-bosses-brings-confusion-1432175402\" target=\"_blank\">  s the </a> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-zappos-banishing-the-bosses-brings-confusion-1432175402\" target=\"_blank\">  Wall Street Journal suggests </a></u>, it might take &ldquo;five extra hours of meetings a week as workers unshackled from their former bosses organize themselves into circles and learn the vocabulary of Holacracy.&rdquo; Critiques are also based on the questions left unanswered. As Aimee Groth sustains in her<a href=\"http://qz.com/317918/holacracy-at-zappos-its-either-the-future-of-management-or-a-social-experiment-gone-awry/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> article</a>in Quartz, &ldquo;HolacracyOne, provides a basic framework but has left big questions unanswered, like compensation and hiring/firing&rdquo;. It becomes harder to calculate compensations when there are many people doing many roles at the same time and switching constantly. Companies like Zappo have even created a specific department to calculate compensations now that they operate under Holacracy rules.<h3> <strong>  In Brief </strong></h3>Today&rsquo;s workplace environment is changing at a rapid pace, a far cry from the cubicle and hierarchical structure of yesteryear. In order to yield a high rate of productivity,  companies are seeking ways to understand the needs of every employee. Through Holacracy, employees are given the opportunity to be leaders in their own right. However, adopting this new structure can be a shock for many employees, especially those ones coming from a bureaucratic background. The system doesn&rsquo;t seem to offer a clear pathway for its adoption, making the latter even harder and improvised.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 17:31:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 17:31:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_vJDVie7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/whats-going-on-with-holacracy-the-system-willing-to-banish-bosses/\", \"post_id\": \"9155\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 17:31:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 17:31:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"whats-going-on-with-holacracy-the-system-willing-to-banish-bosses\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9154\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4355\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Whats-Going-on-With-Holacracy-the-System-Willing-to-Banish-Bosses.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"858\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455130800,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

She was flying on Southwest Airlines and checked a piece of luggage. When the suitcase showed up on the luggage carousel, we noticed the handle was damaged. Bummer! I&rsquo;ve been through this before.</p><p> Not happy, I walked into the Southwest office. What I expected was a long line, followed by a less-than-enthusiastic employee, extensive paperwork to fill out, and then who knows how long it would take to get the luggage repaired. However, I was pleasantly surprised. After all, this was Southwest Airlines.</p><p> <strong>  What I encountered was the opposite of what I expected. </strong> Only one person was ahead of me, and the Southwest employee had a great attitude. When it was finally my turn, just a minute or two later, I was given a choice. I could fill out some paperwork and arrange to have my luggage repaired, or Southwest would replace my luggage with a brand new piece; immediately &ndash; on the spot.</p><p> I wasn&rsquo;t sure I heard the gentleman correctly. So, he took me into a room that was filled with all types of new luggage. He said to pick out the one that closely resembled my broken luggage. I did, and after a very short amount of paperwork to acknowledge the exchange, it was just a matter of transferring my daughter&rsquo;s belongings into the new luggage before heading home.</p><p> <strong>  This was an unexpected and amazing experience. </strong> What started out as a Moment of Misery&trade; turned into my favorite customer service experience: a  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/online-store/moments-of-magic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Moment of Magic&reg;  </a> </u> . I&rsquo;ve only had my luggage damaged twice in over thirty years of travel, and both times were far different than this recent hassle-free experience. I remember on both occasions, two somewhat apathetic employees (obviously not Southwest employees) who were just going through the motions of taking care of me as I filled out paperwork telling me who to take my luggage to and how to get reimbursed. <strong>  Once again, Southwest Airlines figured it out. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  There are at least a couple of lessons we can learn from this story: </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First </strong> , Southwest Airlines has a reputation for being a friendly airline &ndash; perhaps the friendliest airline in the US. Competitive prices, free checked luggage, and friendly employees are what they are known for. It&rsquo;s easy to be great when things go well. <strong>  It&rsquo;s when things don&rsquo;t go well that can make or break a reputation. </strong> That&rsquo;s when a good system has to be in place. That system, along with properly trained employees, can be the difference between losing and retaining a loyal customer.</p><p> <strong>  Second </strong> , ideally, doing business with any company should be a hassle-free experience. Unfortunately, the airlines are subject to a number of potential problems, some of which are out of their control, such as weather or heavy air-traffic. But, some problems are in their control. In the case of damaged luggage, Southwest Airlines stepped up and took ownership of the problem. <strong>  They know it&rsquo;s going to happen, </strong> so as part of their system, they created the most customer-focused solution they could come up with.</p><p> <strong>  I&rsquo;ve written and talked about this before. </strong> Southwest Airlines may not be the airline for everyone, and they admit this. Some may not like their numbered boarding pass system that doesn&rsquo;t allow for reserved seats. Some may not like that they don&rsquo;t have meal service. But, Southwest is very clear about what they offer. It&rsquo;s their brand promise. Simply put, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.southwest.com/html/about-southwest/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Southwest Airlines mission  </a> </u>   <strong>  &ldquo;is dedication to the highest quality of customer service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit.&rdquo; </strong> They typically deliver on that promise. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s earned them intensely loyal customers. Nobody is perfect, but if more companies were as customer-focused as Southwest Airlines, I think we, as customers, would all be happier.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 17:57:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 17:57:03.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ETkKyuS.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/southwest-airlines-gives-us-another-lesson-in-customer-loyalty/\", \"post_id\": \"9156\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 17:57:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 17:57:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"southwest-airlines-gives-us-another-lesson-in-customer-loyalty\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9154\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4356\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Whats-Going-on-With-Holacracy-the-System-Willing-to-Banish-Bosses.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"503\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455134400,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}

While oversharing is a rather common Internet phenomenon, many people don&rsquo;t realize that sharing too much about your personal life affects your professional status. Financial advisors are not immune to oversharing either. When it comes to blogging, some financial advisors try to connect with their clients by providing personal information, often too personal of information. Keep your blogging professional by only mentioning the basics about yourself, such as your educational background, your career highlights, and your areas of specialty.</p><p> Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   blog  </u> </a>  needs to be devoid of personality. You can still communicate your personality, just make sure that it&rsquo;s your professional personality. In other words, use your blog to communicate that you are a highly professional, successful and serious financial advisor with insightful and informative advice to give.</p><h3> <strong>  Inconsistency </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re going to professionally blog, make sure that you do it regularly. One of the easiest ways to lose public interest is to be inconsistent with your posts. Make a schedule to blog and stick to it. That means you need to be realistic about how often you can reasonably post to your blog. Don&rsquo;t over-post either, as people may begin to suspect that you spend all of your time on the Internet and not enough time on your clients and their financial needs. Aim to write one to two posts a week, and then make sure you meet that goal. Nothing says &ldquo;unprofessional&rdquo; like inconsistency.</p><p> In order to keep readers interested in your blog, it&rsquo;s important that you stay on top of it. If you disappear for weeks at a time, you readers will not only lose interest in your blog, but they will also turn to other financial advisors who offer them regular and consistent advice. In addition, keep your blogs a consistent size. Don&rsquo;t write four pages one week and then 40 characters the next. Aim to write about 2-3 insightful, well-written paragraphs on a regular, weekly basis.</p><h3> <strong>  Be Informative and Accurate </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another common mistake that financial advisors make when writing their blogs is posting information that they have not thoroughly researched. Your clients are looking for informative, accurate and professional advice, and your professional reputation depends on your giving it to them. Make sure that you check your facts when you post information, as you could lose clients due to misinformation. Remember, as a financial advisor, you are in a position of authority, as your clients trust you to provide them with accurate information and sound advice. Bad research equals bad advice, so much sure you know what you&rsquo;re talking about before you post it online.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-09 18:02:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-09 18:02:00.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_YS0gOMQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-avoid-the-3-biggest-blogging-mistakes-financial-advisors-are-making/\", \"post_id\": \"9158\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-09 18:02:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-09 18:02:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-avoid-the-3-biggest-blogging-mistakes-financial-advisors-are-making\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9157\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4357\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Avoid-the-3-Biggest-Blogging-Mistakes-Financial-Advisors-Are-Making.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"624\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455126300,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4197,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Strengthen Client Relationships by Determining If They Are Cargo, Passenger, or Co-Pilot","link":"strengthen-client-relationships-by-determining-if-they-are-cargo-passenger-or-co-pilot","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Here is a simple test to get to know how your clients relate to their investments. Hint: how they relate to their investments is how they will relate to YOU. In other words let&rsquo;s discover a way to quickly tell how your clients want to work with you. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great to know?</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s how.</h3><p> <br/> Ask your client or prospect this question: <strong>  &ldquo;When it comes to investing are you cargo, passenger, or co-pilot?&rdquo; </strong> Let that sink in; I can assure you they won&rsquo;t have an immediate answer. They have never been asked this question and might even be put-off that you have made cargo one of the three choices. That&rsquo;s good, this will stimulate them and make them sit up and pay attention.</p><p> Then explain what you mean. &ldquo;Imagine an airplane. Cargo, like your suitcase, just needs to ride underneath in the storage area. Passengers, however, want to know where they are going, want to plan the trip, and enjoy looking out the window. Co-pilots are passengers too but are also capable of actually flying the plane. However, they all end up in the same place. My question is, how would you prefer to get there?&rdquo;</p><h3> I have all three types of clients&mdash;and so do you&mdash;though you may not know it yet.</h3><p> <br/> Cargo could not tell you the difference between a stock and a bond. But, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t be excellent investors with the help of a patient advisor. Passengers are competent or at least curious investors, and want to learn more, and follow a plan. Co-pilots are experienced able investors, are equipped to invest themselves, but still need help, and appreciate having another set of hands on the wheel in an emergency. One is not better than the other. Repeat, one is not better than the other. Don&rsquo;t position this as a scale or ranking. For example, co-pilots are not necessarily better investors than cargo, they just need to have more control.</p><p> <strong>  Think of this from your client&rsquo;s perspective. </strong> If you treat your client like cargo but he sees himself as co-pilot we have a problem. The client&rsquo;s need to direct and course correct may not be met, and it could even bruise his ego which will frustrate him and make him seek another advisor.</p><p> If you treat your client like a co-pilot, but she is cargo, she&rsquo;s in for a scary ride. She doesn&rsquo;t want to hold the wheel for take-off and landing, she just wants to get there. The more you scare her by showing her charts and graphs (as in flight plans), or computer analyses of the peaks and troughs of the market (as in panoramic views out of the cockpit window), the more uneasy she will become.</p><p> Finally, if you treat your client like cargo, but they prefer to be passengers then they won&rsquo;t have the positive and fulfilling experience they desire. They may shut down completely and it could strain your relationship and their financial future.</p><h3> Here is an actual example.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  I was fired by important clients because I treated them like passengers. </strong> They really wanted to be more in control of their investments than I thought they did. I discovered too late that they were co-pilots. When they told me they wanted to invest in bank stocks at the bottom of the market in March 2009 I told them they already had enough. When they said they wanted to invest their free cash, I told them that they needed to keep a cushion. This is not how you treat a co-pilot. It was my fault, the clients found an advisor willing to share the cockpit. Lesson learned.</p><p> <strong>  The whole point of this conversation is to understand your clients better. </strong> Perhaps it will be easier having this type of conversation if you frame it in these three terms. I believe this will be more effective for you than the more traditional way of getting to know your clients by asking about their tastes in restaurants, movies, religion, or politics. Your clients&rsquo; likes or dislikes may be important but they have little direct relationship with how they manage money.

Nevertheless, Deloitte <u> <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/12/09/in-the-future-we-will-have-robo-advice-on-steroids\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  are estimating </a></u> that roboadvisors will take $5 to $7 trillion in assets by 2025, so they won&rsquo;t be so small then, and the incumbents are now waking up to them.  Charles Schwab launched a roboadvisory service just under a year ago in March 2015, and have already snapped up $5.3 billion in assets under management (AUM).Nevertheless, the China meltdown has had an interesting side effect in that people want to talk and the larger firms, like Charles Schwab, are relying on good old call centers and blog posts to explain to people what&rsquo;s happening with their investments, rather than some robocall.  Schwab say that staff are working longer hours as calls have increased 30% since December, as have online discussions.<strong> &ldquo;There are times when people just want to talk &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s just to reinforce that they&rsquo;re doing the right thing,&rdquo;</strong>said Tobin McDaniel, San Francisco-based president of Schwab Wealth Investment Advisory, which offers robo services to clients with at least $5,000 to invest.   Equally, Morgan Stanley has said it is looking at a hybrid model &mdash; human advisers &ldquo;augmented&rdquo; by digital technology &mdash; while Bank of America Merrill Lynch is poised to launch an automated offering that could &ldquo;complement&rdquo; financial advisers, according to a spokesperson.In other words, we may live a digital world, but when it comes to our Material World,<strong> we still need the human touch.</strong>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-10 15:30:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-10 15:30:08.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Vvj3qJb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/digital-not-when-its-material/\", \"post_id\": \"9161\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-10 15:30:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-10 15:30:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"digital-not-when-its-material\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9159\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4360\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Strengthen-Client-Relationships-by-Determining-If-They-Are-Cargo-Passenger-or-Co-Pilot.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"482\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455210000,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s smarter beta that generates smart alpha by bringing out the best in active managers. <br/>  </li><h3> Core-satellite investing continues to be very popular, combining a passive core portfolio with active satellite managers.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s an active-passive approach. </strong> The original purpose of the core portfolio was a completeness fund, rounding out a team of specialist active managers. In its simplest form, an active growth stock manager and an active value stock manager are rounded out by a passive core, but the common practice for this core needs improvement.  In practice, &ldquo;core&rdquo; is almost always a total market index, like the S&amp;P500, so it dilutes active satellite managers rather than completes them. The S&amp;P500 is value and growth and core, all wrapped into one.</p><p> Somewhat ironically, the S&amp;P as core actually results in an unintended bet against true core, defined as the middle of the market, in between value and growth. I call this middle of the market &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.ppca-inc.com/CentricCore/CentricCore.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Centric Core </a> &rdquo; to contrast it to the blend that is typically used as &ldquo;core.&rdquo; To be precise, centric is the 20% in the middle. The S&amp;P is not true core; in fact it&rsquo;s only 20% pure core. So even if you allocated as much as 80% to the S&amp;P as core, you would have only 16% (20% of 80%) in true core, which is less than the market weight of 20%. A more efficient and diversified approach would be to allocate just 20% to centric core and 80% to active satellite managers, thereby obtaining market diversification. Centric core is to value and growth as mid-cap is to large and small. Unless you have particular timing skills, it&rsquo;s best to diversify among sizes and styles.</p><p> Allocating more to active satellite managers should result in higher alpha for the total portfolio if the active managers are producing alpha, which is a reasonable supposition since they would only be hired if they were expected to produce value added.</p><h3> Result: Smart Alpha.</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.paladindigitalmarketing.com/managing-objectives-using-post-modern-portfolio-theory/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dr Frank Sortino  </a> </u>  uses an active-passive approach to portfolio construction, using passive to fill in parts of the market where he does not find skill. His optimizer always calls for centric core. This implies that there are no active managers who excel at managing the middle of the market, which is no surprise. Those skillful managers who call themselves &ldquo;core&rdquo; are actually blend managers, covering core and value and growth. To capitalize on active manager skill while maintaining diversification, a centric core completes the manager line-up, with only a 20% allocation.</p><p> <strong>  Core-satellite has been embraced as a way to diversify and lower costs, but the S&amp;P500 as core does neither. </strong> It results in an underweight to the middle of the market, so it does not diversify. And it undermines active manager decisions with deadweight stocks the active managers deem unworthy. This dilution comes at a cost that can easily exceed the &ldquo;savings&rdquo; attributed to a passive index, so costs are actually increased rather than decreased. Centric is the new core that really does improve diversification and performance.  Centric core is a disruptive innovation that replaces the S&amp;P500 as core.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-10 16:48:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-10 16:48:29.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_wa6SlK0.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-sp-500-is-not-smart-smart-beta-and-smart-alpha-are/\", \"post_id\": \"9162\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-10 16:48:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-10 16:48:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-sp-500-is-not-smart-smart-beta-and-smart-alpha-are\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9159\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4361\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Strengthen-Client-Relationships-by-Determining-If-They-Are-Cargo-Passenger-or-Co-Pilot.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"409\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455206400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

When you&rsquo;re not closing deals, you&rsquo;re learning about your market&mdash;and reinvesting this knowledge into your future sales strategy, existing customer support operations, and new product development initiatives.</p><h3> <strong>  TREND #3: SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENTS A CLEAR WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Takeaway: </strong> Make yourselves available as consultants and educators through channels like LinkedIn and Twitter</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/social-selling-stats-that-will-inspire-you\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HubSpot points out  </a> </u>  that 98% of sales reps with more than 5,000 LinkedIn connections meet or surpass their quotas. At the same time, research from the Sales Management Association points out that two-thirds of companies do not have a clear social media strategy.</p><p> As crowded as social media might seem, there is a strong opportunity for B2B sales reps to develop a presence, create content, and start building relationships. At the end of the day, social media is a mechanism for building relationships at scale.</p><p> Rather than broadcasting a generic message, you should feel comfortable sharing your expertise and shedding insight into the customer pain points that you tackle each day. Make yourself available and visible by writing compelling content, answering discussion thread questions, and responding to questions that prospects might be asking.</p><h3> <strong>  FINAL THOUGHTS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Technology has placed new constraints on sales teams to become subject matter experts, become transparent, be helpful, and demonstrate more empathy. Rather than crafting the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; sales presentation or pitch, focus on asking good questions and listening your way to an authentic connection.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-10 17:09:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-10 17:09:38.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_NmR32Wo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-evolving-sales-landscape-in-3-simple-trends/\", \"post_id\": \"9166\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-10 17:09:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-10 17:09:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-evolving-sales-landscape-in-3-simple-trends\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9165\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4363\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Evolving-Sales-Landscape-in-3-Simple-Trends.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1030\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455214500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4202,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Which Matters Most: A Job, a Career or a Calling?","link":"which-matters-most-a-job-a-career-or-a-calling","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of my favorite quotes ever comes from Steve Jobs who famously once said <strong>  &ldquo;Passion is the difference between having a job or having a career&rdquo;. </strong></p><p> When we graduate and embark on a new job, it doesn&rsquo;t come with a GPS device or road map. It&rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination. Careers and life in general will take many twists and turns over the years. Maybe you get promoted, or laid off or face relocation to a new state. You start your married life and possibly have children. Your values change as different things take priority.</p><p> All too often when people enter the workforce, they just want a J-O-B. For them it&rsquo;s all about the paycheck and benefits. Having a job provides tangible rewards as you work to survive.</p><h3> At some point your brain and heart click in and you figure out that what you really want is to have a career.</h3><p> <br/> Now what becomes important to you is seeing a path ahead and being rewarded with a new title, bigger job, more recognition and ultimately more money. Coupled with this is a need for recognition and appreciation. Attaining these things is what has you believe that now you&rsquo;ve got a good career going.</p><p> For a large percentage of the workforce, this is the &lsquo;destination&rsquo; that they were looking for on their personal journey. There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with this as your goal. To have a fulfilling career is a great goal. But to some, there&rsquo;s still something missing.</p><p> For this group, it&rsquo;s all about a calling. Money is great, as is responsibility, advancement and recognition.   What&rsquo;s missing for many of us is that undeniable feeling that we don&rsquo;t want to just survive but rather we want to THRIVE. Having a calling is getting up everyday knowing that we are doing what we are passionate about and knowing that we can impact lives by what we do.</p><p> In 2011 I was fortunate to be able to morph my career into a calling to speak to others about reengaging both in life and at work. The number one question I get when I speak to people around the country is &ldquo;how do I make my passion my career and find my calling&rdquo;.</p><p> Here are a few of my thoughts around working to thrive, not just survive:</p><li> <strong>  You need to be willing to take a really long look in the mirror and pay attention to what you see back in your reflection. </strong> You can&rsquo;t make change if you don&rsquo;t accept what needs to be different. It all starts with being open to what&rsquo;s really happening for you in the workplace. No sugar coating is allowed in this process.</li><li> <strong>  Take out a plain sheet of paper and make two columns, one that is labeled aspirations and the other marked deal breakers. </strong> Now start listing those things you want to do and then move over to the other column to record what you aren&rsquo;t willing to compromise on. For me, when I did this exercise I knew I wanted to do something more creative, to be able to write and speak about engagement. My first deal breaker was that I no longer was willing to work for anyone else.</li><li> <strong>  Be thoughtful, plan-full and strategic. </strong> And while it&rsquo;s great to dream, you also need to inject a dose of reality in there. Think about how you can monetize your passion. It may mean that you start out small while you are still working at your job and do some things on the side to develop this passion and a build a financial cushion. It takes time to build a business or look for a new job. You need to completely understand that things don&rsquo;t happen overnight.</li><li> <strong>  Patience is key and it&rsquo;s important to remember that it is always better to work toward something better, not run away from something bad. </strong> If your passion is strong it will still be there years down the road. Anything good is worth waiting for.</li><li> <strong>  From day one of your work journey, always remember to save for a walk-away fund. </strong> It&rsquo;s incredibly important to save for retirement as soon as you get a paycheck to get the full effect of compounding to grow your portfolio, but it&rsquo;s also smart to start this second fund as well. Have one or two less coffees a week, go out drinking with friends two less times a month, buy one less pair of shoes a month. Whatever it takes put that money to better use so you can fund your passion. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Remember, anything good is worth waiting and working for. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-10 17:15:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-10 17:15:45.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_3AYoEvG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/which-matters-most-a-job-a-career-or-a-calling/\", \"post_id\": \"9167\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-10 17:15:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-10 17:15:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"which-matters-most-a-job-a-career-or-a-calling\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9165\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4364\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Evolving-Sales-Landscape-in-3-Simple-Trends.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1014\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455220800,"author_id":415,"chart_url":""}

We&rsquo;ve all been there. It was love at first sight. They loved your product, and told you so. Repeatedly. You had great conversations. They asked for a proposal. You spent hours on working on a masterpiece.</p><p> You sent it through. Then nothing. Not a bleep. You e-mailed. Gently. Nothing. Called them. <strong>  Still nothing. Reached out. Again. Again. </strong></p><h3> Still nothing. Now what?</h3><p> <br/> The #1 rule to observe is to stay cool, and don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions. You see, this is not about you. It&rsquo;s about them. Something has changed on their side, and your job is to find out the answer to three simple questions.</p><li> What happened that made them stop the conversation?</li><li> Why did it happen?</li><li> Does it still make sense for us to keep talking? <br/>  </li><p> Your job is not to be obnoxious and to keep pushing. Your job is also not just to give up and move on.  <strong>  Your job is to stay on the ball, and determine whether it makes sense to move forward. </strong></p><p> So if you are struggling to get prospects to call you back, try these three practical tips to get back on their radar &ndash; and back in the game.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Deliver something of value </strong></h3><p> <br/> Reaching out and providing a piece of relevant, related information will help you reach out in a way that is non-threatening and adds immediate value. Worried about whether they will &ldquo;get the message&rdquo;? Trust me, they will.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make a helpful introduction </strong></h3><p> <br/> Make an introduction to someone who can help them succeed. Maybe it&rsquo;s someone who holds a similar (or more senior role) in another firm. Maybe it&rsquo;s someone who can help them solve a problem you know they&rsquo;ve been working on.</p><p> The point is: provide a helpful introduction to someone you know they will value, and you will add value to both parties (and yourself).</p><h3> <strong>  3. Back away </strong></h3><p> <br/> If all else fails, use a strategy called &ldquo;reversing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s like an old Jedi trick used by master salespeople. It is basically the equivalent of saying &ldquo;Hey. Things may have changed. I&rsquo;m busy. You&rsquo;re busy. I&rsquo;ll assume this is not going to happen (unless you tell me otherwise).&rdquo;</p><p> By using this strategy, you invoke two of the most powerful principles in human psychology. First, scarcity: you are sending a clear message that the offer (or you) will not be available forever. Second, you send a subtle message that you are equal to them in every way. You are just as busy. Your time is just as valuable.</p><h3> So. If you want get prospects to return your calls &ndash; don&rsquo;t push. Pull.</h3><p> <br/> Which brings me to my next point. You are not some needy salesperson crying out for their attention. You are not begging for their business. You are a businessperson of equal worth, stature and reputation in every single sense. People are naturally drawn to confident (not cocky), successful people. Signaling you are such &ldquo;people&rdquo; will have your prospect notice, and entice them to get in touch. Because important people matter.</p><p> By following these three simple steps, you make it safe for them to continue the conversation. You are telling them you will not abuse their confidence, rob them of their time and cling to them like a salt water barnacle. You are not &ldquo;just checking in&rdquo;, or wasting their time. You are delivering value every step of the way.</p><h3> Will this work every time?</h3><p> <br/> No. Some prospects will continue to ignore you, and some will continue to hide and play games.

Sometimes, a new perspective can help to move inclusion efforts forward. </p><p> Pinterest is a good example of one company that has recently taken steps to amp up its diversity and inclusion efforts. They&rsquo;ve acknowledged the diversity shortcomings within the company, which is why they&rsquo;ve created a brand new position to help them become more inclusive. According to Mike Isaac&rsquo;s New York Times article  <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/pinterest-hires-its-first-head-of-diversity/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Pinterest Hires Its First Head of Diversity  </u>  ,&rdquo;  </a> Pinterest recently hired Candice Morgan as their first-ever chief diversity officer (CDO).</p><p> While this doesn&rsquo;t mean Pinterest&rsquo;s diversity will improve overnight, this is a great first step in combating an issue that runs rampant in Silicon Valley.</p><h3> Inclusion is a business imperative!</h3><p> <br/> Not simply the &ldquo;right thing to do,&rdquo; morally, but the right thing to do for your business. Candice Morgan, Pinterest&rsquo;s new CDO, gets this distinction.&ldquo;Diverse teams &mdash; in terms of demographics and thought &mdash; outperform homogeneous teams on innovation and problem solving,&rdquo; Morgan said in a statement.</p><p> <strong>  Morgan is reinforcing the idea that inclusion is an incredible business strategy. </strong> Inclusive leaders know that they must first build a diverse workforce and then work to be inclusive of the ideas and inputs of that diverse workforce. Without the benefit of diverse input&mdash;internally and externally&mdash;companies will be challenged to succeed in an increasingly competitive, and increasingly global, environment. </p><p> Isaac mentions in his article that, under Morgan&rsquo;s lead, Pinterest is introducing two new programs. One is Pinterest Engage, which is intended for college students who are looking to pursue a major and career in computer science. The other program &ldquo;invites minorities with nontraditional tech backgrounds to apply for a year-long apprenticeship at the company, with the potential to join Pinterest full time.&rdquo;</p><p> Of course, not every organization can afford to bring a CDO on board. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t take steps to get outside perspectives to help move their diversity and inclusion efforts forward. All organizations can benefit from outside perspectives. And all organizations can benefit from boosting their inclusive behaviors.   </p><p> We can help! InclusionINC works with companies to boost their inclusion effort to ensure a measurable, bottom line impact.

But what I DO KNOW is what I WOULD HAVE SAID in any given circumstance. My values guide my decision-making, so the answer would always be the same. If someone tries to twist my words, I just think &ldquo;Is that something I could have possibly said?&rdquo; If the answer is no, I move on. At the end of the day, if you are leading consistently, you really don&rsquo;t have to remember that much.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Exactly. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  5 SECRETS TO EFFECTIVE DECISION MAKING </strong></h3><p> <br/> Winning Well managers know that like everything else that matters, decision-making is always an AND game of Confidence AND Humility, Results AND relationships. </p><p> Winning Well leaders know that making the right decisions is clearly only the beginning, it&rsquo;s also about building decision making competency throughout your team.</p><h3> 1. Be Crystal Clear on Your Values.</h3><p> <br/> Taking some time to really consider your values and operating principles will save a lot of time-consuming waffling and hand wringing down the line. Write down your  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/authenticity-transparency-trust/how-to-build-a-leadership-credo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  leadership credo </a> , that way when the decisions get tough, you&rsquo;ve got the scaffolding already in place.</p><h3> 2. Insist that people on your team make decisions they should make.</h3><p> <br/> You use energy to make decisions. The more decisions you make in a day, the more difficult it becomes to make the next one. Stop making decisions you don&rsquo;t need to make, and invest in helping your team build their decision making muscles. Ask great  <a href=\"http://letsgrowleaders.com/communication-listening/7-questions-you-should-ask-when-you-launch-a-new-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  strategic questions </a> . Be sure your team understands your values and any big rules. Most importantly, if you empower them to make the decision, don&rsquo;t freak out when they make the wrong one. Take a deep breath and then work to understand the thought process, so the next decision they make will be less wacky.</p><h3> 3. Make low-risk decisions quickly.</h3><p> <br/> If the consequences are minimal, make decisions quickly and move on. Save your 3 am worry for decisions that matter.</p><h3> 4. Make decisions once</h3><p> <br/> This is an old and essential productivity tool. Look at an email once, then either delete it, act on it, schedule it for future action, put it in a file related to its project, or put it in a &ldquo;maybe read later.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5. Include the right players.</h3><p> <br/> Before making any major decision ask yourself, &ldquo;Who really needs to be involved in this and why?&rdquo; Stakeholder, yes, but resist the urge to over-include.</p><p> Of course, you can follow these guidelines and still screw it up. Sometimes I do too. When that happens, don&rsquo;t obsess, but do take a moment to reflect and take that learning with you for the next time.</p><p> <strong>  Your turn.

Then come the  <strong>  imitators </strong> , who copy what the innovators have done. Sometimes they improve on the original idea, often they tarnish it. Last come the <strong>  idiots </strong> , whose avarice undermines the very innovations they are trying to exploit.  </p><h3> The problem, in other words, isn&rsquo;t with innovation itself &mdash; it&rsquo;s with the imitation and idiocy that follow.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t get smarter about things as basic as greed,&rdquo; </strong> Warren Buffett warned Charlie Rose.</p><p> I totally agree with his three Is. We see this when it comes to customer experience. I've written about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/08/innovate-dont-imitate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   innovation  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/06/cx-journey-musings-are-we-dumbing-down.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   imitation  </a> </u>  in the past, but I haven't written about the idiots - well, not in so many words.</p><p> Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those who we cannot resemble. -Samuel Johnson</p><p> Here's where I think this - the idiot/greed part - applies to the world of customer experience: (1) focusing on acquisition, and (2) focusing on maximizing shareholder value.</p><h3> Focus on Acquisition</h3><p> <br/> When companies focus on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2016/01/yea-but-will-they-keep-you-as-customer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   acquisition  </a> </u>  (over  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/12/the-secret-to-customer-retention.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   retention  </a> </u> ), it's all about more, more, more. At all costs. They might talk about a great customer experience or advertise a great customer experience, e.g., \"Better than Amazon!\" They've jumped on the lingo bandwagon because they've heard \"customer experience\" is important. Maybe they've even tried to imitate others (culture, business approach, customer focus) but have failed miserably. They do all that in hopes of attracting more customers, of growing the business. Except they fail because there's no real stuff behind their fluff. It's not based in reality. It's not based on their business, who they are, and their own culture and way of doing business.</p><h3> Focus on Shareholder Value</h3><p> <br/> When companies focus on maximizing shareholder value, they aren't focusing on the customer experience or making it priority #1; they're not innovating or imitating. We know the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/06/what-is-purpose-of-business.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   purpose of a business  </a> </u>  is to create and to nurture a customer. We need to forget about that 1970s mindset, that the purpose of a business is to maximize shareholder value. Being customer-focused and customer-centric translates to shareholder value. Focus on the customer, on creating customers, and the profits will come. It might take a little longer, but it will happen.</p><p> I love a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/02/05/salesforce-ceo-slams-the-worlds-dumbest-idea-maximizing-shareholder-value/#6da3570e5255\" target=\"_blank\">   recent Forbes article  </a> </u>  that outlines the problems with focusing on shareholder value. I think you'll be able to see very easily how this focus leads to the idiocy that moves companies far away from innovation (bold is mine):</p><li> pervasive short-termism;</li><li> diverted human and financial resources from needed investments in innovation;</li><li> dispirited both employees and managers, leading to pervasive disengagement; </li><li> generated &ldquo;bad profits&rdquo; that undermined customer loyalty;</li><li> caused excessive &ldquo;financialization&rdquo; of the economy, making it vulnerable financial crashes;</li><li> incentivized CEOs to become financial engineers and companies to lose their entrepreneurial mojo;</li><li> led firms to pursue the extraction of value, rather than the creation of value; </li><li> undermined the economic recovery from the Global Financial Crisis;</li><li> drastically reduced rates of return on assets and on invested capital;</li><li> appropriated gains that flowed from workers&rsquo; improvements in productivity; and</li><li> led to secular economic stagnation and increasingly unsustainable economic inequality. <br/>  </li><p> Customers come before shareholders. Understand their needs, your own customers' needs, not your competitors'. Do your own thing. Nobody wins when you imitate. When there are clear, differentiated choices of products, services, and/or experiences in the marketplace, the decision is made easier for your customers. Bring your own unique value to the table. When customers' experiences with one company stink, they have the ability to go purchase from someone else. Let them decide.</p><h3> Be at the top of the food chain! Lead the pack. Innovate.

Or thought about this question yourself if you&rsquo;re a woman?</h3><p> <br/> In the personal finance industry, there are reports galore that try to capture and answer this very question. According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prudential.com/media/managed/wm/WM-new-womens-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2014 Prudential study  </a> </u> , women appear to be less worried about their financial security than they were in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Note: this didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they felt overly confident about their finances either.</p><p> With women, money and feelings are a big part of my every day work, so I put the question out to my network of women (who are a mix of Gen Y &amp; Gen X) and asked them, &ldquo;If you could only use one word to describe how you feel about money, what one would you use and why?&rdquo;</p><h3> The response? Well, it&rsquo;s complicated.</h3><p> <br/> As expected, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be just one way women feel about money. The responses revealed a large spectrum of emotional attitudes that we could categorize as follows:</p><h3> <strong>  Love / Enthusiasm </strong></h3><p> <br/> For those of you that associate money with love, you&rsquo;re not alone. In fact, women are twice more likely than men to associate cash flow with feelings of love and generosity according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-014-0756-x/fulltext.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Indicators Research study  </a> </u> .</p><p> A positive attitude about money means you probably allow yourself to enjoy it and take action to fulfill your money goals, which only heightens your positive sentiments.</p><h3> <strong>  Conduit </strong></h3><p> <br/> Others shared a hopeful feeling about money and the potential gains it offers to a fulfilling life. For these women, money is a channel that connects life and affords certain possibilities.</p><p> So maybe this is a more neutral feeling about money that is seen as a tool to support the life we want &ndash; a tool that can be harnessed and controlled in the direction we determine. This is an empowering feeling and one that is especially effective in aligning money with your values and priorities.</p><h3> <strong>  Fear </strong></h3><p> <br/> Fear around money can be the result of a feeling of unpreparedness.</p><p> In many cases, being prepared to weather a future storm by having enough saved in your emergency fund, adequate insurance coverage and a detailed financial plan that keeps you on track can go a long way in curbing feelings of fear.  Instead, fears about money can be tempered with confidence that you&rsquo;ve safeguarded yourself against something bad that could happen.</p><h3> <strong>  Stress / Work </strong></h3><p> <br/> Feeling stress, worry or even burdened about money is more common than you might think.  According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-014-0756-x/fulltext.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Social Indicators Research study  </a> </u> , 33% of women think about their finances all the time and 22% lay awake at night trying to figure out a way to spend less money and save more, even if they are already saving money,</p><p> If you find that your stress levels around finances become too much to bear, don&rsquo;t be ashamed to ask for help or seek out a financial professional who can help you as much or as little as you want to feel a little less burdened.</p><h3> <strong>  Intrigued / Curious </strong></h3><p> <br/> As a financial advisor, I just loved seeing this feeling expressed about money: curiosity to know more.</p><p> More women than ever are interested in learning about finances and the great news is that there are many resources available, literally at your fingertips, if you&rsquo;re one of them!  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prudential.com/media/managed/wm/WM-womens-research-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to research done by Prudential  </a> </u> , nearly a third of women use financial company websites (31%) and financial news websites (29%) as tools for researching and learning about finances. Nearly one in five (19%) use financial planning websites and 12% of the women surveyed used social media to research financial topics.</p><p> What the assortment of words and responses show is that there isn&rsquo;t just one overriding feeling women have about money like these common blanket statements: Women are &ldquo;scared of money,&rdquo; &ldquo;fearful of the market&rdquo; or &ldquo;completely in love&rdquo; with their money. Feelings are varied and evolving, and largely depend on each person&rsquo;s experience with money.</p><p> The truth is, you&rsquo;re not alone in however you feel about money. There is no right or wrong, just recognition of where you are today and where you want to go financially in the future.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a woman looking to kick-start your financial education in a safe place with other women, check out the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/WorkYourWeath/#_=_\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Work Your Wealth Facebook group  </a> </u>  where we&rsquo;re sharing, learning and conquering our money issues on a daily basis.</p><p> What one word would you use to describe how you feel about money?

These days, data that used to provide some level of clarity now seems to just add confusion. Job growth is up&hellip;but the stock market is down. The US economy is recovering&hellip;but China&rsquo;s flailing economy has our markets reeling. The Fed finally raised interest rates&hellip;but mortgage rates aren&rsquo;t following suit. The market is soaring one day&hellip;and plunging the next. Oil prices are down&hellip;but the impact on energy stocks and local economies in areas like North Dakota and Texas are putting a dent in consumer confidence.</p><p> All of this gives the media a lot to banter about. But in reality, no one really knows what&rsquo;s going to happen tomorrow or in the next 18 months. Instead of wasting your energy listening to the media circus, here are my recommendations for maintaining your sanity&mdash;and your savings&mdash;through what&rsquo;s sure to be a wild ride:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Take solace in cycles. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The market is cyclical. And yet many investors have great difficulty removing emotion when it comes to expected and anticipated downswings. While things are by no means &ldquo;normal&rdquo; lately, one thing that hasn&rsquo;t changed&mdash;even since 2008&mdash;is that the market consistently goes up over time. Keeping this in mind can help keep your emotions at bay and your portfolio on track. (For more on emotions and investing, see my September 2015 blog  <u>  Apples, lemmings, and why you should just stay put </u> .)</p><h3> <strong>  2. Keep calm. </strong></h3><p> <br/> While the market is on a tumultuous ride, keep in mind where we are compared to 2008. As of today, the market is down 6% for the year. While that&rsquo;s not good news, it&rsquo;s a far cry from a bear market decline of 20%. Even if the market does drop further, pulling out of the market is precisely the irrational behavior that compounds the problem. Keep your eye on the long game, stay away from the media hype, and know that a good strategy is built to sustain volatility. If you still need help breathing, read  <u>  t </u> <u>  his </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t speculate. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you know any day traders, they&rsquo;ve probably lost a bundle in the last few weeks. Why? Their job is to speculate on short-term opportunities. Even in the best of times, a cheap stock isn&rsquo;t necessarily a good buy. And when the market is as unpredictable as it is today, speculation can be a losing game&mdash;big time.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Take advantage of good opportunities. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Of course, as Warren Buffett says, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" In a down market, there will inevitably be opportunities to buy stock in wonderful companies at fair (or better!) prices. On that note, here&rsquo;s another favorite Warren Buffet quote to keep in mind: \"Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.\"</p><h3> <strong>  5. Consider cutting back. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are overly concerned about the state of your portfolio, perhaps the best thing to do is strive to live on a little less for the time being. I&rsquo;m suggesting delaying large spending projects until next year or when the market gets through this phase of the cycle. And when the market recovers, you&rsquo;ll have that much more in your pocket to enjoy on a rainy day.</p><p> The most important thing to do in times like this is stay away from any major changes&mdash;in your life and in your investing approach. None of us can control global events or their impact on the stock market. What we can control is how we handle that impact at an individual level to maintain a solid, thoughtful strategy moving forward. At Guerin Financial, our job is to help you build a portfolio that&rsquo;s aligned with your tolerance for risk and can generate adequate returns in a variety of market conditions in the years ahead. No matter how crazy things may seem, remember that we&rsquo;re keeping our eye on the market precisely so you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-10 18:47:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-10 18:47:02.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_GNC14VH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/welcome-to-a-wild-and-crazy-world/\", \"post_id\": \"9177\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-10 18:47:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-10 18:47:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"welcome-to-a-wild-and-crazy-world\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9171\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4372\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3-Ways-To-Get-Prospects-To-Call-You-Back.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"530\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455199200,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4211,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Tips for Transitioning to a Mobile Workforce","link":"5-tips-for-transitioning-to-a-mobile-workforce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Virtually commuting to the office is becoming more and more popular. Working remotely has advantages for both employees and employers, but it poses unique challenges for managers. Effectively managing a virtual team requires both traditional management skills as well as an appreciation for long-distance professional relationships. If you&rsquo;re a manager in a company that&rsquo;s transitioning from a physical office to a remote setup, here are five tips for managing a mobile workforce.</p><h3> <strong>  Set SMART Goals </strong></h3><p> <br/> SMART goals, which are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-oriented, are used in many managing situations (including traditional offices). They&rsquo;re especially useful in virtual settings, when you aren&rsquo;t able to physically monitor employees&rsquo; work. As your immediate oversight diminishes, the role goals have increases.</p><p> As your team transitions to a remote setup, adjust by relying on quantifiable goals more. Focus more on project completion and meeting deadlines, and less on how a project was done.</p><h3> <strong>  Insist on a Schedule </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the primary reasons employees want to work remotely is so they can integrate their professional and personal lives. Having flexibility to arrange professional work around personal interests is a significant benefit, but it also is a potential danger. Some employees struggle to stop working and enjoy their free time, which can lead to burnout. Other employees have the opposite struggle: They procrastinate and have a hard time working, which leads to rushed work and missed deadlines.</p><p> As a manager, you have a duty to make sure your employees don&rsquo;t burn out and meet their deadlines. Insisting on a schedule can help guard against the two risks. Give your employees the freedom to create their own schedule, but insist that they stick to the schedule they create.</p><h3> <strong>  Check In Often </strong></h3><p> <br/> Virtual environments aren&rsquo;t conducive to two-minute conversations that often happen at the water cooler or on the way to the restroom in a traditional office. While most of these conversations revolve around insignificant small talk, they also provide you, as a manager, with an opportunity to address minor issues. Without these short conversations, small issues can balloon over time into major problems.</p><p> In order to address small things before they grow to be serious problems, schedule regular check-ins with your employees. You might try:</p><li> having a weekly team meeting</li><li> seeing how each employee is doing weekly</li><li> switching from annual reviews to shorter monthly reviews <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Pick Up the Phone </strong></h3><p> <br/> Working remotely is primarily done online, using computers and tablets. Phones can also play an important role in your management strategy, though. Phones let you communicate more efficiently, and they make it easier to express yourself. Whenever a deadline is pressing or a message could be misconstrued, call your employees instead of emailing or texting them.</p><h3> <strong>  Remain Professional </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you don&rsquo;t see your employees every day, it can be easy to forget that they&rsquo;re your colleagues. While the stereotypical virtual employee might be a young 20-year-old sipping lattes in a local cafe or a stay-at-home parent still in their pajamas, your employees don&rsquo;t fit this stereotype. They&rsquo;re the same professionals that worked in your office, and they deserve to be treated professionally. All communication should be sent in a professional tone.</p><p> As your company transitions to a virtual office, you&rsquo;ll face unique management challenges. Use the techniques you&rsquo;re familiar with, like SMART goals, but adapt your knowledge for the virtual world. In time, you&rsquo;ll come up with creative solutions, like these tips, that address the challenges you face and help you effectively manage your team remotely.</p>Source: http://www.hr.virginia.edu/uploads/documents/media/Writing_SMART_Goals.pdf","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-10 18:52:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-10 18:52:25.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_RUSH8Jw.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-tips-for-transitioning-to-a-mobile-workforce/\", \"post_id\": \"9179\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-10 18:52:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-10 18:52:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-tips-for-transitioning-to-a-mobile-workforce\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9178\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4373\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-Tips-for-Transitioning-to-a-Mobile-Workforce.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"495\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455212700,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

Can you give me some pointers? </strong></p><h3> A: Of all the topics I blog about, the 30 60 90 day plan seems to get the most attention.</h3><p> <br/> That actually came as a bit of a surprise to me &ndash; it&rsquo;s not exactly the sexiest of subjects. Everyone knows they should probably be building these plans but many of us aren&rsquo;t exactly sure when and how to use one. So this blog is going to be all about the different ways you can use a 30 60 90 day plan.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re just getting started and want to learn about the basics of the 30 60 90 day plan, check out my first  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/blog-1/2015/9/20/the-best-30-60-90-day-plan-and-how-to-use-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog  </a> </u>  on the topic. You can also get the PowerPoint version of my 30 60 90 day plan  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   template  </a> </u>  (it&rsquo;s free btw and there aren&rsquo;t any weird forms or sketchy pages to go to either).</p><p> The 30 60 90 day plan is a much more versatile tool than most people realize. The average bear might use this type of plan when starting a new job. In and of itself, that is not a mistake. However, most people use the 30 60 90 day plan as a way of documenting his or her thoughts to help keep them on track. In my first post I talked about how the 30 60 90 day plan is actually a tool to help align other people to a common framework for your success &ndash; a way of setting you up to win. It&rsquo;s not a tool designed to help you prioritize or stay on track. Check out the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/blog-1/2015/9/20/the-best-30-60-90-day-plan-and-how-to-use-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   first post  </a> </u>  for more on that.</p><p> What I didn&rsquo;t discuss in the first blog is how flexible these plans are. There are many opportunities to build them into your routine. What is a 30 60 90 day plan really? It&rsquo;s a concise way of taking one or more objectives and communicating a 3 phase plan to achieve them, with a dashboard to measure performance. As a model, it has almost endless applications. If you&rsquo;re only using it in your first two weeks at a new job, you&rsquo;re missing out.</p><h3> Here are some of the ways I use the 30 60 90 day plan:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Any project that will take more than 90 days. </strong>  This one might seem obvious but I don&rsquo;t really see people doing it in practice. What I see are project plans &hellip; task lists. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a project plan, but it only addresses one component of the 30 60 90 day plan purpose. Listing out a bunch of tasks with owners and statuses is fine for executing a project, but it does very little to guarantee your own success. The reason I like the 30 60 90 day plan is that it&rsquo;s designed to establish clear alignment between you and your boss (and other influencers) on a common definition of success.  In my opinion it&rsquo;s reckless to embark on a big project that is going to consume so much of your time and energy without first agreeing on the criteria that will guarantee you a win when it&rsquo;s done. When you jump straight into the project plan phase without first aligning on a definition of success, you&rsquo;re leaving too much to chance.</p><p> <strong>  Any large initiative that can be broken down into multiple phases. </strong> I love phases. I&rsquo;ll probably do a blog on the subject in the weeks to come. When you first look at a big project or initiative, it can often seem daunting just in the pure scope of it. This is especially the case for multi-month and multi-year initiatives. It&rsquo;s hard to get your arms around an undertaking that big. The result is that most of us just write down a massive list of tasks with a milestone here or there and dive right in. The problem with that approach, especially for longer initiatives, is that you have to wait too long to declare any measure of success. When I&rsquo;m managing a project I don&rsquo;t want to let it go more than a month or so before I can announce some sort of win.</p><p> When we don&rsquo;t apply the 30 60 90 day plan approach we inadvertently load all the success measures at the end of the project. When success is only evaluated at the end you&rsquo;re unnecessarily delaying recognition for your work. It creates unwanted risk because you&rsquo;re obfuscating all the little successes along the way and combining them into one. Which means if you don&rsquo;t knock the entire project out of the park, you won&rsquo;t have any of the wins along the way to fall back on. But when you segment a big initiative into phases, and define individual success criteria for each phase, you get credit for your performance much more frequently. This means you can build up a track record of success throughout the lifetime of the project instead of having it so heavily leveraged on the final deliverable.</p><p> <strong>  Any job interview that is in the final stages. </strong> I spoke about how to use a 30 60 90 day plan for job interviews in a recent keynote speech.  <u>  Check it out </u> .</p><p> <strong>  At the beginning of a new fiscal period. </strong>  I like to start every quarter with a 30 60 90 day plan to align with my boss on what success will look like. On the surface it might seem like a bit of overkill but I really don&rsquo;t think it is. If I can get my manager to agree on exactly how the quarter should go and exactly how we&rsquo;re going to measure my success and failure, I&rsquo;ve set myself up for a big win. One of the reasons I feel so strongly about this is that by proactively doing a 30 60 90 day plan at the beginning of a quarter, you&rsquo;re the one setting the criteria for success vs. allowing your boss&rsquo;s feelings or subjective appraisal of your work determine your performance. I want to be the one defining my own success &ndash; I don&rsquo;t wait and hope for the best.</p><p> <strong>  After a performance review. </strong> Check out my recent blog on  <u>  performance reviews </u>  for a detailed discussion around this scenario. What normally happens, whether a performance review goes well or poorly, is that the employee and manager both leave the review meeting feeling optimistic about the future. Feedback is shared, a discussion about what it&rsquo;s going to take to be successful ensues, and then &hellip;. Nothing. I strongly recommend following up your performance review meeting with a 30 60 90 day plan that shows exactly how you&rsquo;re going to execute on what was aligned to in the meeting itself. A clear plan of attack with a scorecard to measure your performance. Delivering a follow-up plan like this will make a big impact. It will show you&rsquo;re serious about success and set you up well for a great performance rating next time around.</p><p> <strong>  When launching a new IT system or tool. </strong> These are notoriously messy projects and more than a few of us have taken damage to our careers by being a part of a failed systems implementation or migration. It&rsquo;s critical to break these types of projects down into clear objectives and phases and get your boss to agree on what success looks like at each stage along the way. Otherwise you&rsquo;re leaving too much to chance in what are typically runaway, over time, over budget projects. I recommend segmenting the project into phases and modifying the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   30 60 90 day plan template  </a> </u>  to suit your needs. In the case of a systems project, there may be more than 3 phases and it may take longer than 90 days. That&rsquo;s fine. You can use the same template and just add more phases e.g. research phase, design phase, testing phase, implementation phase and optimization phase. Then for each phase you identify objectives, tasks and a performance scorecard.</p><p> <strong>  When on-boarding a new vendor or agency. </strong> I really like this use case because someone else has to do the actual work. Whenever I bring on a new vendor, like a PR agency or an engineering firm, I make them complete a version of the 30 60 90 day plan. We&rsquo;ve all had vendor relationships that get off to a slow start or just never seem to go how we imagined they would. The 30 60 90 day plan can help. By having the new vendor complete the plan, all parties get aligned with a common definition of success and you don&rsquo;t wait until 6 or 12 months into the relationship to see that it&rsquo;s failing. The only difference between this use case and the standard one, is that you&rsquo;re on the other side of the equation. If you start using the plan with vendors I think you&rsquo;ll see an immediate positive impact.</p><p> I hope these ideas are helpful.

{"original_id":4214,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"6 Reasons to Focus on Content Marketing in 2016","link":"6-reasons-to-focus-on-content-marketing-in-2016","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There&rsquo;s been a critical shift in online marketing.</h3><p> <br/> While online marketing tactics once required heavy advertising expenses to get in front of an audience, that&rsquo;s no longer the case.  Many companies are now adopting a less sales-heavy marketing approach on the web: content marketing.</p><p> Content marketing uses high quality content to draw potential customers to a business, with the hopes that the content will help establish the company as a thought leader, set their expectations about buying and using a product or service, and ultimately convincing potential customers to become paying ones.</p><p> While many companies have been using content marketing as a strategy for years, the tactic is going to become even more critical in 2016. Check out the six reasons below to learn why.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Ad-Blockers are on the Rise </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ad-blockers are a technology that can prevent unwanted advertisements, like banners and pop-ups, from appearing on a web page. While they have been available for years as plugins on desktop web browsers, ad-blockers took a critical step forward this past year when Apple allowed ad-blocking technology in iOS 9. This means that people can now block digital ads while using their cell phones, greatly reducing the number of people who will ever see a digital ad.</p><p> Ad-blockers have caused a huge loss revenue for publishers and businesses  <a href=\"https://blog.pagefair.com/2015/ad-blocking-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  (  <u>   Adobe and PageFair  </u> </a>  estimate the loss to be about $22 billion during 2015). While your potential customers may never see a company&rsquo;s pre-roll video or sidebar ad, they will see (and appreciate) an informative blog or video they choose to consume after they&rsquo;ve searched Google for a topic.</p><h3> <strong>  2. It Works Hand-in-Hand with Social Media </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no question that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/08/social-networking-usage-2005-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media  </a> </u>  will remain one of the most popular ways that people connect in 2016. Take advantage of the mobile mindset this year and create content that people will want to share, instead of ads that feel annoying and intrusive. Getting customers to share your content on their social media profiles is not only a great way to build your brand&rsquo;s reputation, it&rsquo;s also an excellent way to take advantage of free promotion &mdash; and having more social media shares also boosts your site&rsquo;s overall SEO.</p><p> Additionally, content marketing can fuel social media efforts, eliminating the question, &ldquo;what should we put on our social media profiles.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  3. People are Consuming Things On-Demand </strong></h3><p> <br/> Our society is becoming one that likes to consume its media on-demand, instead of letting someone &mdash; like a television network &mdash; dictate when they should see it. Things like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-binge-watching-streaming-video-on-demand/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   online video and television streaming services  </a> </u>  are more popular than ever. So, you can use content marketing this year to take advantage of this on-demand mindset. Offer things like blogs, videos and quizzes, then wait for your potential customers to come to you.</p><h3> <strong>  4. It Boosts SEO </strong></h3><p> <br/> Content marketing is an absolutely crucial step to boosting your  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/seo-is-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   site&rsquo;s SEO  </a> </u> . With more and more sites on the web, coming up on the first page in search engine results is critical for getting discovered online. Write blogs and high-quality written content filled with relevant keywords and topics this year, and you will help ensure that the money you invest in your online presence actually pays off.</p><p> Digital advertising strategies are shifting, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to give up on Internet marketing as a lucrative avenue entirely. Instead, focus on creating high quality content that potential customers value; you may just see your business start to grow.</p><h3> <strong>  5. It&rsquo;s a Great Compliment to Traditional Marketing and Paid Media </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s say you own a professional services company and place an ad on the radio. Your ideal customer is driving and your ad plays on the radio. Later that night, when things finally wind down for the day, your ideal customer recalls your ad and does a web search for your company. But it&rsquo;s 9 o&rsquo;clock, and your company is not open. They can&rsquo;t talk to anyone then.</p><p> Content  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/gated-content-generate-better-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   placed strategically on your website  </a> </u> , though, is available 24 hours a day seven days a week. When your customers finally pick up that direct mail piece you sent or recall the ad they heard, will they find more than just your products and services on your website? Or will they find information that answers the questions they have?</p><h3> <strong>  6. It Helps Close the Sale </strong></h3><p> <br/> A prospect recently downloaded something from our company website and asked for an in-person meeting. When I showed up for the meeting, he had printed two white papers from our website. Rather than spend the meeting covering the basics, he already had many of his questions answered. This left us to focus on substantive conversation about his particular business.</p><p> Having content that is helpful for your potential customer at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/the-marketers-3-step-content-roadmap-aligning-content-with-your-buyers-journey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   various stages in the buying process  </a> </u>  will help you close sales, and the transparency will be appreciated. When you have nothing to hide as a seller of a product or service, your customer will take notice.</p><p> How can you use content marketing to promote your brand?

Crying will quite likely damage them permanently. If they want something, you should drop whatever you&rsquo;re doing and meet their desires immediately. Giggle encouragingly when toddlers throw sassy tantrums. Reinforce their natural assumption that, as the parent, you exist to be the most fawning and adoring slave they&rsquo;ll ever have. It&rsquo;s especially true if you live in fear of your child&rsquo;s temper. The younger you ingrain this mindset for them, the more successful they will be at manipulation, control, and self-centeredness.</p><h3> Rescue them from the consequences of their actions, while blaming everyone else.</h3><p> Refuse to allow your child to feel the brunt of their negative choices or poor behavior. Step in and divert any natural results that might help them learn a memorable lesson. Shelter them from their own pain and whatever pain they intentionally or accidentally bring to others. Blame anyone and everyone else for your child&rsquo;s failures. Whatever happened is always the other kid&rsquo;s fault, the teacher&rsquo;s fault, the school&rsquo;s fault &mdash; but it can never, ever be their own responsibility.</p> <h3> Pave the road smooth so they rarely, if ever, surmount their own obstacles.</h3><p> Hard work is fine for some, but your kids are better than that. Help your little geniuses along by removing as many challenges as possible so they feel good about themselves without any effort. Do homework for them, build their class project, offer excuses when they make mistakes instead of encouraging them to humble themselves and say sorry. Of course, constantly remind them that they&rsquo;re ah-mazing, even when they&rsquo;ve only invested mediocre energy.</p> <h3> Don&rsquo;t require respectful manners or social courtesies.</h3><p> Make apologetic excuses when they are rude or disrespectful. Refrain from intervening when your child is aggressive or thoughtless to peers and grownups. Let them sit comfortably in the best chair while an elderly person is left standing. They&rsquo;re just kids, they can&rsquo;t be expected to stand or wait patiently. Say this out loud to nearby adults, so your children know you don&rsquo;t expect much from them in the way of social graces or self-denial. Reassure their burgeoning egos that they have authority equal to, or even greater than, the grownups around them.</p> <h3> Praise them constantly, especially for things they haven&rsquo;t actually earned.</h3><p> Focus on external appearance &mdash; make sure they know they are more attractive than all the other kids. Don&rsquo;t merely tell them they are precious to you, inflate their sense of value beyond what they have accomplished. Place excessive emphasis on public performances that enhance your image as a parent, and ignore the small thoughtful deeds they may do in private.</p> <h3> Shower them with material things in place of quality relationship.</h3><p> Forget investing quality time into teaching and learning. Skip nature walks and deep conversations and reading books out loud. Instead, make sure they know that things are far more important than people. Allow unsupervised, unfettered access to media, technology, TV, video games &mdash; anything to feed their pleasure centers and provide shallow entertainment.</p> <h3> Act like externals (i.e. skin color) are perfectly acceptable reasons to judge people.</h3><p> Make them believe their own race is best, and people of other colors are not their equal. Imply that others are jealous of their superiority, or that society has it in for them because of their ethnicity, or both. Reserve your acts of compassion and sympathy for those who fit your racial and cultural comfort zone. Don&rsquo;t let your children become close friends with families who don&rsquo;t look like them, and who don&rsquo;t share a similar socio-ethnic background.</p> <h3> Avoid the time-suck of compassionate activities that bring zero personal gain.</h3><p> Instead of setting an example of empathy and kindness to your children and those around you, show them how to be aloof, emotionally distant and disdainful toward anyone who can&rsquo;t return an equal or better favor. Let your kids overhear you speaking with disregard and arrogance about others whom you feel are beneath you.</p> <h3> Don&rsquo;t give them chores or expect them to do physical work.</h3><p> Manage all household functions for them. Let them grow to believe that dirty work is beneath them. They are too precious to have to fold their own laundry, help prepare meals, clean their own toilets, work in the garden, or make their own beds. Be sure they know you think they are better than work that makes them sweat; getting dirty is undignified for someone of their potential.</p> <h3> Encourage elitism.</h3><p> Lead them to believe that the whole world owes them, and it&rsquo;s okay if they break the rules to get what they &ldquo;deserve&rdquo;. Model this lack of integrity in your own life, even when you think they&rsquo;re not watching. Remember, self-esteem is far more important than moral character, and reinforce this in your words and example.</p> <h3> Obsess about what other people think of you.</h3><p> Whether you&rsquo;re driven by a deep-seated need to be well-liked or a paralyzing fear of other people&rsquo;s judgment, generally disregard meeting people&rsquo;s needs unless it is an opportunity to have something good reflect back on you. Model a constant awareness of what people think by verbalizing criticism and judgment about how others look, what they say, and why you&rsquo;re essentially better than the rest of the world.</p> <p> If that&rsquo;s not your goal, then perhaps a different approach is needed? Try aiming for a counter-culture lifestyle rooted in the powerful example of service, where your children grow up to be shockingly humble and grounded.</p> <p> To achieve that, you might start by living a life focused on loving, grace-filled character growth in yourself and your children. Be unashamed of hard work, service to others, and unswerving dedication to integrity&mdash;and expect those qualities in your kids.</p><h3> Muster the courage to communicate about really tough topics and embrace the chiseling of painful learning experiences.</h3><p> <br/> When your children do well, praise their process and perseverance rather than merely performance value. And when you see them doubting their ability to conquer something that appears impossible &mdash; perhaps even the daunting task of conquering themselves &mdash; you could encourage them with love and acceptance, going together to seek wisdom on your knees.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t, society will very likely turn them into narcissists anyway.</p><p> <strong>  Disclaimer: </strong> <br/> Recently I took a poll of those in my circle of influence, asking what they observe as contributors to the whelming tide of narcissism in modern culture. This tongue-in-cheek article grew out of those responses. I could have written a typical straightforward article about how to raise helpful, humble children, but those are a dime a dozen. In case anyone is still wondering &mdash; no, I do NOT think we should intentionally raise a narcissistic child.</p><p> <strong>  nar&middot;ci&middot;ssis&middot;tic </strong> <br/> [nahr-suh-sis-tik] <br/> 1. characterized by extreme self-absorption, fantasies involving unrealistic goals, excessive need for admiration and disturbed personal relationships.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-11 18:15:56.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-11 18:15:56.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_dtthZou.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-raise-a-narcissistic-child/\", \"post_id\": \"9187\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-11 18:15:56\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-11 18:15:56\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-raise-a-narcissistic-child\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9186\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4378\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Raise-a-Narcissistic-Child.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"776\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455307200,"author_id":426,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4217,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"For Valentine's Day, Think About Relationships","link":"for-valentines-day-think-about-relationships","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> So, the romance day of the year is nearly upon us. Valentine&rsquo;s Day is surely a time when people think about their relationships.</h3><p> <br/> Beyond their significant other, though, I wonder if many business leaders spare a thought for their work-related relationships?</p><p> I ask because of seeing so many companies, over so many years, take a simplistic &amp; at times patronising approach to &lsquo;building relationships&lsquo; with both their customers &amp; their employees. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying the principle of building relationships with these two communities is wrong, far from it.</p><p> The evidence is overwhelming as to the relative value of retaining a satisfied customer rather than just acquiring new ones. Many a manager will also tell you how much more productive &amp; cost-effective it is to keep motivated employees, rather than keep spending more on recruitment. So, there is nothing wrong with the goal.</p><h3> <strong>  Businesses get it wrong </strong></h3><p> <br/> Where, I feel, businesses fall down is the approach taken to achieving this goal. All too often it feels like these are just &lsquo;relationships&rsquo; as a means to an end. Talking about &lsquo;loving&rsquo; your customers or colleagues while really just taking the latest route to greater profit, will fall through. People are not stupid &amp; disingenuous actions are almost always be seen through over time. Besides, I fear the approach taken by many such communications comes across more like a &lsquo;player&lsquo;, than a person wanting to build a mutually rewarding relationship.</p><p> Perhaps the root cause is not too much focus on relationships, but too little. After generations of industry experts talking about CRM, Customer Centricity, CXM and numerous other buzzwords &ndash; I could fully understand you still feeling skeptical. But please bear with me. What I mean, is that for all the business &amp; technical waffle, perhaps the relationships analogy (on which all the above are based) is too superficial an understanding of real world relationships.</p><h3> <strong>  Valentine&rsquo;s Day </strong></h3><p> Let&rsquo;s return to the theme of Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p><p> Imagine the scene. You&rsquo;ve remembered the card, flowers, present and dinner reservation (which would be a minor miracle for me). There you both are, gazing lovingly at each other over a candlelit table in your favourite restaurant. What do you do next?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a few options inspired by real life &amp; business, you can judge which is which:</p><li> Remind your &lsquo;love&rsquo; how much you spent on this evening (so they &lsquo;value you&rsquo;)?</li><li> Eat meal quickly and suggest you go straight to &lsquo;intimacy&rsquo; ASAP?</li><li> Take time to talk and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company?</li><li> Offer to upgrade to the premium menu selection, if they will sign a contract to stay with you for another year?</li><li> Keep using their name &amp; reciting past interactions, to prove that you remember them?</li><li> Offer them money for their time and &lsquo;services&rsquo;?</li><li> Give them a tacky gold star &amp; tell them you&rsquo;ll be publishing their photo on Facebook as &lsquo;date of the month&rsquo;? <br/>  </li><p> Well I think you get the point (and if you&rsquo;re thinking of trying some of those, you better be prepared to duck when the slap comes!)</p><h3> <strong>  Faking it won&rsquo;t always make it </strong></h3><p> <br/> As I&rsquo;m sure you can see, my point is that what businesses routinely do to their customer &amp; staff, to &lsquo;build relationships&rsquo;, is tacky &amp; fake compared to real life. You will know from your own experience that such behaviour comes across as  manipulative or downright creepy when you translate it your real relationships. But, somehow, we forget these basics in the strange world of corporate marketing. Simplistic versions of personalisation, that try too hard, seem to make sense. Overtly buying loyalty or even bribing &lsquo;recommendation&lsquo;, sounds acceptable  &amp; there is always the pressure to close the sale after the briefest of customer foreplay.</p><p> Perhaps just as telling, is how this same behaviour is seen in the ways leaders seek to motivate their employees. Tacky recognition schemes, paying cash bonuses for doing a job well or using performance management systems to tell some of your team that they are better than others. Is there another area of your life where you would consider gold stars, bribery or giving them an &lsquo;A&rsquo; to be an authentic way to build a relationship? Worse still, there is compelling research that such an approach devalues the work your people do. In his fascinating book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/punished-rewards/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Punished by Rewards&ldquo;, Alfie Kohn  </a> </u>  shares how the nobility &amp; meaning people seek in their work is undermined by training employees to just do it for the money or promotion.</p><h3> <strong>  Hope from your relationships </strong></h3><p> <br/> Enough doom &amp; gloom. Not everyone gets this wrong &amp; I want to end on a positive note.</p><p> After over 30 years of mostly happy married life, even I have learnt a few things about building &amp; maintaining a loving relationship. Taking time to keep getting to know that person better. Being considerate &amp; kind to them. Protecting time to really give them your attention. Enjoying their company &amp; opening up about so many areas of your shared life. Trying new things. All these &amp; more, play such an important role in long-term happy relationships of all genders &amp; orientations.</p><p> Are there any signs that businesses are &lsquo;getting it&lsquo;? Well, I&rsquo;ve spotted a few encouraging developments over recent years.</p><h3> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s what looks like better practice to me: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> A focus on identifying customer irritants &amp; fixing them (without a big song &amp; dance);</li><li> If a customer gives a bad rating/feedback, follow-up with prompt contact to apologise, learn &amp; fix;</li><li> Content marketing that is relevant to customers &amp; just given away for free (without requiring sign-up);</li><li> Leaders encouraging technical excellence in their teams &amp; listening to what those teams know needs fixing;</li><li> Leaders taking time to meet customers;</li><li> Employees encouraged to  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/now-its-personal-just-be-you-the-customers-will-love-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   be themselves so their response to customers is authentic  </a> </u> ;</li><li> Co-creation its customers, to share understanding of what products or service could be built;</li><li> Insight generation (from data, analysis &amp; research) that is managed well, tested &amp; improved over time;</li><li> Fair pricing that rewards loyalty, without going on about it all the time;</li><li> Transparency of sharing feedback on websites, demonstrable accountability;</li><li> When things go wrong, businesses &amp; leaders who first apologise (not first make an excuse). <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Over to you </strong></h3><p> <br/> Those are only a few situations &amp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have examples from your experience. Please do share what you&rsquo;ve seen &amp; appreciate.</p><p> For now, just let me take time to encourage a more genuine longer term approach to relationships with customers &amp; employees. Honesty about what you can offer &amp; want in return. Taking time to listen to the other person &amp; learn from the insights you glean. Valuing them with attentive service &amp; conversations that interest them.</p><p> Perhaps if we all take that ethos away from Valentine&rsquo;s Day this year, we could even start to build real relationships for the rest of the year.</p><p> <strong>  Enjoy yourselves. </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-11 18:23:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-11 18:23:27.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_5HSskf7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/for-valentines-day-think-about-relationships/\", \"post_id\": \"9189\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-11 18:23:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-11 18:23:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"for-valentines-day-think-about-relationships\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9188\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4379\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/For-Valentines-Day-Think-About-Relationships.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"563\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455303600,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}

Article reprints</h3><p> <br/> This is the most traditional way to push your story out to a broader audience. With article in tow, your Sales team can distribute the positive piece to clients who may be interested in a particular product, portfolio manager, asset class or sector. Every publication is different but, in general, you&rsquo;ll need to contact the outlet to purchase article reprint rights. You can usually buy digital rights at the same time, allowing you to share the article electronically and post it on your internal/external websites.</p><p> Two caveats to consider. First, be selective because buying reprint rights can be costly. Make sure your Sales team and other colleagues can really use this article to their advantage. Second, the rights are typically time-bound (e.g., for six months or a year), so have a plan in place to make prompt use of the article.</p><h3> 2. Linking</h3><p> <br/> A cheaper way is to link to the article (or video/audio clip) in email messages, e-newsletters or from a website teaser that you create. Just be mindful that the piece will be housed on the media outlet&rsquo;s website, so you&rsquo;ll be relying on them to keep the content posted for a certain period of time. Also, since some sites impose paywalls that may impede access to content for some of your target audience, linking is not always an effective route to take, despite the cost efficiency.</p><h3> 3.

{"original_id":4219,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Who Are Your Ideal Clients Now?","link":"who-are-your-ideal-clients-now","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Financial advisors who are successful at attracting ideal clients are faced with one challenge. The challenge is segmenting your clients. If you are growing, then segmenting your ideal and non-ideal clients is an annual process if you are growing at 15% or more per year. Why do you segment? Segmenting is a tremendous opportunity to grow your practice. Segmenting will help you focus your time and energy on your ideal clients</p><h3> <strong>  Get rid of guilt </strong></h3><p> <br/> Have you ever felt guilty about not servicing or communicating to some of your best clients who pay you the most fees? Be honest! I ask advisors in workshops across the country and they always say what I felt as an advisor, guilt towards servicing your ideal clients more. How can you get rid of that guilt? Obviously by servicing your top clients more. But if you are past capacity and lack the time, then you probably do not even have the time to segment your clients, once, let alone on an annual basis. Your non-ideal clients sometimes take up all your time and energy, leaving you scrambling to service your best clients in the way you would like to.</p><h3> <strong>  Why segment? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Think of segmenting from a simple exercise of ideal clients and non-ideal clients. Not potential ideal clients but defining your clients as they are today.</p><p> There are several advantages to segmenting including:</p><li> Your clients sometimes want to know where they stand as a client- tell them you are one of our ideal clients and we only have 50 or 75 ideal clients.</li><li> Your staff want to know who to pay close attention to- let them know who the ideal clients are today.</li><li> Your revenue will increase because you are spending more time and attention with your ideal clients. You attract all of their assets and give them the service to get their financial planning, investment and goals in order and keep them on track to reach their goals. <br/>  </li><p> You earn more by segmenting your clients annually. According to Business Health Pty Ltd of Australia, 62% of advisors segment their practices. Those advisors that segment their ideal clients from their non-deal clients earn on average 33% more than those advisors who do not segment. This is a from their research warehouse of USA advisor database (Source Business Health Pty Ltd. 2014 US Advisors Key Value Drivers USA* The Value of Practice Management)</p><h3> <strong>  How do you segment? </strong></h3><p> <br/> While there are several different methods to segment clients, the key metric to use is revenue. Top financial advisors know that everything must be measurable: segmenting by revenue per client on an annual basis is the number one measurement to use. Besides revenue, the most common ways advisors segment their clients is part subjective and part numerical. For example, some advisors put the word&rdquo; influence&rdquo; on a client&rsquo;s benchmark. Does this client refer ideal clients to your firm and is he or she influential with others?</p><p> Other measures you can use to segment include:</p><li> Do they have all of their business with you or do they work with two advisors?</li><li> Do they trust your advice and implement your advice?</li><li> Are they open when discussing goals and have 3-4 or more goals planned out with you?</li><li> Have they house-holded accounts with you, meaning you work with the whole family?</li><li> They know how to refer business to you and are have?</li><li> They generate sufficient upfront fees and ongoing fees/ commissions for planning and advice?</li><li> Agree and like your communication approach? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The next step? </strong></h3><p> <br/> So how can you start segmenting your clients? It can be quite simple, start by creating an excel spreadsheet and add in the following categories above and or create your own. Create a scoring method and determine if they are ideal clients, or non-ideal. Now the hard part comes in which I will discuss in future blogs. Creating two plans, one plan for ideal clients, processes and systems, and one plan for non- ideal clients processes and systems. You have to have a plan for each. Once you create those plans, it will become clear how you are going to grow your business at 15% or more on an annual basis and tackle capacity. Good luck in growing your practice!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-11 18:39:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-11 18:39:30.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_nKWsTsu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/who-are-your-ideal-clients-now/\", \"post_id\": \"9192\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-11 18:39:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-11 18:39:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"who-are-your-ideal-clients-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9190\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4381\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/When-You-Get-Good-Press-Keep-the-Momentum-Going.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"488\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455367500,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

As such, the financial services industry has let women down.</p><p> According to a study entitled, Women, Money &amp; Power, commissioned by Allianz, a financial conglomerate, <strong>  &ldquo;fifty-four percent of women believe the financial industry is geared to men.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Additionally, financial advisors are not trained on the emotional aspects of money and the unique emotional challenges women face around it. So most advisors will not know how to help women recognize and overcome these challenges, which leaves women feeling undervalued and misunderstood by most financial representatives they encounter.</p><p> Only recently has the financial industry begun to take notice of the emotional issues women face financially. But that&rsquo;s only because financial forecasts now indicate that women will be the beneficiaries of unprecedented levels of wealth in the coming decades.</p><p> Consequently, we are finally starting to see financial companies taking notice and commissioning studies about women and money in hopes of understanding and capitalizing on this forthcoming shift in wealth ownership for fear that they will miss out on the opportunity to manage these sizable assets.</p><p> For me, retirement planning meetings with my female clients were a frustrating experience, because as a financial advisor, I was not professionally trained to help them overcome their inner emotional blocks around finances.</p><p> Clearly they were experiencing inner barriers and limiting beliefs around money that needed to be transformed, perhaps through coaching. Yet I constantly had to remind myself that the purpose of these meetings was not to provide extensive coaching because I was not getting paid to coach people.</p><h3> I was getting paid to sell financial products.</h3><p> <br/> I eventually came to realize that I was feeling out of alignment with my passion for helping women, because I was not truly serving them by selling them financial products when what they really needed was a personal breakthrough around the emotional side of money, as well as a basic level of financial literacy.</p><p> As a result, I decided to follow my heart and become a life and money coach so that I could truly empower women in their confidence with money.</p><p> In my years of working with women and their money, I have found that a woman&rsquo;s net worth is impacted by her self-worth and vice versa.</p><p> By combining coaching with financial planning, my work is now truly aligned with my higher purpose of empowering women.</p><p> When women feel more confident about the topic of money, they can have the inner trust they need to then go on and work with a financial advisor, because they will be coming from an empowered, healed and more wholesome place with money.</p><h3> Women don&rsquo;t need to be sold more financial products.</h3><p> <br/> They need to be provided with basic financial literacy; the opportunity to explore and transform their own money stories; and educational resources to learn about basic investment strategies in a non-threatening environment (i.e. a community where they feel safe and respected).</p><p> <strong>  To the powers that be in the financial services industry, are you listening? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-11 18:42:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-11 18:42:52.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_iuNKyIM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-the-financial-services-industry-can-truly-serve-women/\", \"post_id\": \"9194\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-11 18:42:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-11 18:42:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-the-financial-services-industry-can-truly-serve-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9193\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4382\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-the-Financial-Services-Industry-Can-Truly-Serve-Women.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"708\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455426000,"author_id":375,"chart_url":""}

Time to gather your financial documents, visit the accountant, sign on the dotted line, and submit your income tax return to the Internal Revenue Service. For many, the process can be frustrating, as the tax code seems to get increasingly complex each year.</p><h3> <strong>  A pending divorce can complicate matters even more. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re in the process of divorcing &ndash;or even thinking that you might be soon &ndash;you need to answer this critical question: Is it in your best financial interest to file a joint tax return with your husband?</p><h3> <strong>  Consider the pros and cons carefully, because filing jointly can have a dramatic impact on your future finances. Be aware that: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  When you file jointly, you and your husband are both financially responsible. </strong>  If it comes to light later that taxes have been underpaid, it won&rsquo;t matter to the IRS which of you was responsible. When you file jointly, the government can go after you both&hellip; even if you didn&rsquo;t personally earn one dime of the reported income! What&rsquo;s more, you will still be liable for errors and omissions in joint tax returns even after your divorce.</li><li> <strong>  The IRS is not bound by the terms of your divorce settlement agreement.  </strong> Some women insist that their divorce settlement agreements should include a provision that if there are tax issues to be rectified down the road, their ex-husbands are responsible. On the surface, that sounds reasonable, and you can certainly hope that your husband would abide by such a provision. Understand, however, that the IRS is not bound by your divorce settlement agreement, no matter what it says about who is responsible for taxes. As far as the government is concerned, if you&rsquo;ve signed the tax return, you own the consequences&hellip; and if taxes are owed, you can be sure they will come after you, as well as your ex, for payment.</li><li> <strong>  You may not know what your husband is hiding. </strong>  If your husband has <a href=\"http://www.bedrockdivorce.com/blog/?page_id=471\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  hidden assets </a> , underreported income, claimed improper deductions or tax credits, and/or engaged in other dishonest shenanigans, you could be liable. Taxes, interest, and penalties can quickly add up to staggering amounts, and you could find yourself owing the federal (and your state) government many thousands of dollars through no fault of your own. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Is there anything you can do to protect yourself against being pursued for tax debt that isn&rsquo;t fairly yours? Fortunately, there is: </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  If you haven&rsquo;t filed yet, but are concerned that your husband is not approaching his taxes with total honesty and integrity: </strong>  Consider filing a separate tax return. Under the provisions for &ldquo;Married Filing Separate&rdquo; (MFS) status, you would be responsible only for taxes on income subject to reporting on your individual return. Using MFS status might mean that in total, you and your husband will pay more in taxes than if you&rsquo;d filed jointly, but believe me, it will be worth it not to be considered responsible for a fraudulent return.</li><li> <strong>  If you already have filed jointly, but are now concerned that your husband did not approach your return with total honesty and integrity: </strong>  Consider applying for  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc205.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Innocent Spouse Relief  </a> </u> , which may absolve you of responsibility for paying tax, interest, and penalties if your husband is found to have made false statements on your joint return. <br/>  </li><p> The IRS recognizes that there are innocent spouses who sign joint income tax returns unaware that anything was amiss, and further recognizes that these innocent spouses need to be protected. However, obtaining innocent spouse status isn&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;easy,&rdquo; and it doesn&rsquo;t happen in an instant. You will have to prove that at the time you signed the joint tax return, you didn&rsquo;t know, and further, that you had no reason to know, that there was an understatement of tax. That can be difficult to establish in all but the most black-and-white circumstances. Indeed, you might need a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2014/09/04/why-a-forensic-accountant-belongs-on-your-divorce-team/\" target=\"_blank\">   forensic accountant  </a> </u>  to help make your case.</p><p> To decide whether you qualify for relief, the IRS will consider your financial situation, your education and business experience, and even whether or not you asked any questions about items on the return when you signed it. They may determine that you qualify for partial relief, i.e. that you might have known about some of the understated income, but had no reason to know about another portion.</p><p> ###</p><p> <strong>  Reminder:  </strong> When it comes to taxes, my advice is the same as it is with all things financial: Be proactive. The more you know about your family finances, including your husband&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2013/01/30/what-a-divorcing-woman-needs-to-know-about-her-husbands-cash-based-business/\" target=\"_blank\">   business  </a> </u> , the less likely you are to sign a joint tax return you can&rsquo;t stand behind.</p><p> <strong>  Hot tip:  </strong> For more information, as well as forms and requirements for applications for Innocent Spouse Relief, visit  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Tax-Information-for-Innocent-Spouses\" target=\"_blank\">   the IRS&rsquo;s web page on Tax Information for Innocent Spouses  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  Legal matters: </strong>  Tax evasion and fraud can result in both civil and criminal prosecution.

There are four spots at the front of the line where kids can get into cars.</p><h3> <strong>  Four. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I should mention that there are over 700 students that attend her school. Yes, some of the kids drive themselves home or walk or bike or take the bus but a heck of a lot are picked up by a parent.</p><p> The first few days I showed up 10 minutes early and was significantly farther than 10 spots from one of the four magic spaces. I moved it up to 15 minutes early and was still at least six spots behind the front four.</p><p> Moving up my arrival time wouldn&rsquo;t actually make it go any faster. I could wait for 25 minutes in one of the four magic spaces or wait for 25 minutes for the front runners to leave and make room for the next group of line leaders. Essentially, that left me with one choice &ndash; waiting.</p><p> Even when there are 30 cars in line, not one car can move up until the first four spaces are vacated.</p><p> A few parents were unwilling to wait in line and created their own pick up process. They parked down the street and told their kids to meet them there. Others pulled up on the grass nearby and got out of the car while wildly waving their hands until their child saw them.</p><p> I don&rsquo;t want an alternative, I want to get to the front, so I wait. Losing 25 minutes a day also isn&rsquo;t of interest so I&rsquo;ve learned to bring my planner, laptop, and a book to ensure I can use the time I have available.</p><h3> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s break this down: </strong></h3><p> <br/> We all strive to get there early.</p><p> Four parents get there first.</p><p> The rest of us wait.</p><p> It feels like a standstill.</p><p> We&rsquo;re actually not stopped, we are idling. Ready to get into motion.</p><p> The line ultimately moves, bit by bit, one car at a time.</p><p> We all eventually make it to the front of the line and pick up our child.</p><p> Goal achieved.</p><p> Sound familiar?</p><p> Getting to the top or your industry or finally getting a promotion or getting some real traction for your small business is not as simple as picking up a kid at school, I get it.

{"original_id":4223,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Sell Complexity Beyond the Customer's Ability to Understand","link":"how-to-sell-complexity-beyond-the-customers-ability-to-understand","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Michael Harris | <a href=\"http://insightdemand.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Insight Demand  </u> </a></p><p> How can you persuade someone to buy your complex product when 90% of your presentation is forgotten within 72-hours <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [i] </a> ?</p><p> The short answer is you can&rsquo;t. Unless you dramatically change how you engage with customers, they won&rsquo;t understand why they should buy your complex product, because of the limitation of our short-term working memory.</p><p> According to memory experts, a salesperson&rsquo;s 88-page PowerPoint product dump presentation will unfortunately not flow directly down through a pipeline into the customer&rsquo;s long-term memory.</p><h3> <strong>  We&rsquo;re All Pinheads </strong></h3><p> <br/> Instead, the information must first travel through our limited short-term working memory that&rsquo;s capable of remembering only 3-4 items <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [ii] </a>  of new information at a time. Now I&rsquo;m not saying that all customers are pin heads. It&rsquo;s just getting information into their heads is more like threading a needle than pushing it down a pipeline. That&rsquo;s why telephone numbers are limited to chunks of 3-4, and it also explains why the best public speakers limit themselves to covering only 3-4 points, because that&rsquo;s all we are capable of remembering.</p><p> But what happens when you can&rsquo;t dumb down your message to only 3-4 points?</p><h3> <strong>  Why You Need to Share a Customer Story </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you want customers to fully appreciate the complexity of your product, you will also have to share a customer story. Because a story presents a scenario that allows the customer to form their own conclusion, without feeling pressured, your message can now bypass the conscious mind&rsquo;s limited ability to absorb new material, because you don&rsquo;t think a story- you experience it. As a result, your message is directly absorbed into the automatic subconscious mind.</p><p> This is important, because it&rsquo;s below the surface of our conscious mind where many of our complex decisions are made.  You&rsquo;ve had this experience. You&rsquo;re thinking hard to try to find the answer, but it just won&rsquo;t come. In frustration, you go for a walk to take your mind off of it, and then, as if from nowhere, the answer suddenly pops into your head. But what was really happening was that all of that time your unconscious mind was processing in the background, and once it arrived at the answer, it communicated the answer to your conscious mind through an emotion. In this case the emotion was certainty. Today, with EEG machines that measure brain activity, researchers are now able to prove that puzzles can be solved 8-seconds before the conscious brain is aware of it <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iii] </a> .</p><p> But even though we can now prove that complex decisions are often made subconsciously, we prefer to think that major decisions are made for rational reasons, because it makes us feel like we are more in control. And yet, our conscious controlled processing in our cortex only came onto the scene around 40,000 years or so ago. So it&rsquo;s weak and buggy like new software compared to our subconscious automatic processing that has had 600-million years to iron out the bugs. This explains why &ldquo;we have inexpensive computers that can solve logic, math and chess problems better than any human being can, but none of our robots, no matter how costly, can walk through the woods as well as the average six-year old child <a href=\"http://insightdemand.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4389&amp;action=edit#_edn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [iv] </a> .&rdquo;  It also explains why my 10-year old son can&rsquo;t divide 180 by 12, and yet he can create a perfect parabola when he throws a ball from 50-yards precisely into the center of my glove?</p><h3> <strong>  A Thought Experiment </strong></h3><p> <br/> So, let&rsquo;s do a thought experiment on controlled vs. automatic decision making. Let&rsquo;s say you are about to take on risk, and you are presented with two options:</p><li> You think it&rsquo;s right, but it feels wrong, or</li><li> It feels right, but you think it&rsquo;s wrong. <br/>  </li><p> What would you be more likely to do? Ideally, you&rsquo;d have both. And that&rsquo;s what you can do by sharing a customer story. They have been able to prove with fMRI scans, for instance, that a story lights up the region of the brain that processes sights, sounds, tastes, and movement <a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [v] </a> . Thus, a salesperson can share a story with a customer, and due to the transportation effect of story, it feels real. It&rsquo;s the next best thing to experiencing it live. It&rsquo;s as if the customer took the salesperson&rsquo;s offering out for a virtual test drive, and experienced it for themselves. Contrast the ability to potentially experience unlimited new information compared to the conscious mind&rsquo;s limited ability to absorb an 88-slide power point product dump.</p><p> In conclusion, to fully appreciate your complex product, the customer has toalso experience it, and this can often only happen through a story.</p><p> Resources</p><a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [i]</a> Brain Rules, John Medina, p. 234<br/><a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [ii]</a> Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2001, Nelson Cowan, professor at Department of Psychological Sciences University of Missouri.<br/><a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [iii]</a> Incognito conscious &amp; unconscious thought, Economist, April 16th2009.<br/><a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [iv]</a> The Happiness Hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt, p 15.<br/><a href=\"/category/sell\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [v]</a> PhysOrg.com, &ldquo;Readers Build Vivid Mental Simulations of Narrative Situations, Brain Scans Suggest,&rdquo; 2009.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-11 19:12:28.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-11 19:12:28.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_9p8yMEi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-sell-complexity-beyond-the-customers-ability-to-understand/\", \"post_id\": \"9199\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-11 19:12:28\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-11 19:12:28\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-sell-complexity-beyond-the-customers-ability-to-understand\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9198\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4385\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Sell-Complexity-Beyond-the-Customer\\u2019s-Ability-to-Understand.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"882\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455192900,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4225,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"7 FBI Tips To Become More Likable","link":"7-fbi-tips-to-become-more-likable","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Not very many people are excited to get a phone call from an FBI Agent.</h3><p> <br/> They tend to be even less enthusiastic when the Agent tells them they need to speak with them about a pending investigation. As a result, I had to work&mdash;hard at times&mdash;to be likable if I wanted to get my job done.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s not only FBI Agents who need to be likable&mdash;as business owners, sales representatives, or leaders you need to impress new clients and competitors with your competence and capabilities. You can miss out on great opportunities to develop new relationships if you&rsquo;re not able to establish a connection with other people.</p><p> <strong>  The more likable you are, the better your chances of being successful. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  Here are 7 FBI tips to become more likable: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Smile </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is the best way to become more likable instantly&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t cost a thing. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just smile when you&rsquo;re in a crowd of strangers and see what reaction you get.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not a toothy person so I smile a lot with my mouth closed. The interesting thing is that a smile on my face changes the attitude in my heart, too.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong>  Remember, a genuine smile requires your eyes so crinkle around the corners so lay off the botox if you&rsquo;re serious about connecting with others.</p><h3> <br/> <strong>  2. Remember Names </strong></h3><p> <br/> Our name is an essential part of our identity, and people feel great when they hear it spoken by others. If their name is unusual, ask the origin. Become more likable by repeating their name in conversation&mdash;it will help you to remember it as well. And of course, get their business card!</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Research shows that people feel validated when the person they&rsquo;re speaking with refers to them by name during a conversation. But don&rsquo;t overdo it&mdash;once or twice is enough. Otherwise you risk sounding too familiar or touchy-feely.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Leave a Strong First Impression </strong></h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2006/july-06/how-many-seconds-to-a-first-impression.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Research by Princeton psychologists  </u> </a>  reveal that all it takes is a tenth of a second for most people decide whether or not you are likable. Longer exposure doesn&rsquo;t significantly alter impressions made within 10 seconds of meeting you.</p><p> People will then spend the rest of the conversation justifying their initial reaction.</p><p> <strong>  As an FBI agent, I knew I might not have more than a few seconds to persuade someone I was likable and to cooperate with me, so I made it count. </strong></p><p> <strong>  TIP:  </strong> First impressions are the result of positive body language. Walk with purpose and confidence, maintain a strong posture, offer a firm handshake, smile, face the person to whom you are talking, and make eye contact. If their eyes start to wander, it&rsquo;s a clue that they may be losing interest in you.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Listen </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is a difficult task for most people. When we&rsquo;re listening to someone else talk, our mind is frequently 1) busy forming a question to ask, 2) trying to process the information that&rsquo;s being spoken, or 3) splitting attention between the speaker and something else that&rsquo;s going on.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> To be likable, give the other person your 100% attention. It will make them feel important and your undivided attention tells them that you genuinely value them.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Show Politeness </strong></h3><p> <br/> Show appreciation and gratitude whenever and wherever you can. It&rsquo;s a habit that can be learned. People really do pay attention to how well you treat strangers, so make it habit to treat everyone well.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Make it a habit to be polite to everyone. Start with shop clerks and work your way up to the airline ticket agents. Once there, you can take on state government employees!</p><h3> <strong>  6. Be Authentic </strong></h3><p> <br/> As an FBI undercover agent, I assumed the identify of a fictitious person. One of the first things I learned that  to be a likable and successful undercover agent, it took more than a fake name. I needed to be authentic and honest with people about who I really was as a person. I could slap on whatever name&mdash;or title&mdash;I wanted, but the only time I got into trouble was when I tried to be someone I wasn&rsquo;t. That is when I came across like an empty government suit, and that held no interest for anyone.</p><p> <strong>  TIP:  </strong> People cannot genuinely find you likable unless they know who you are. Give up trying to impress new people you meet. Instead, share with them who you are&mdash;really, and not whom you think they want to meet.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Exude Confidence </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you come across as insecure, you also risk coming across as needy and/or incompetent. Start from a positive place and others will notice. If you&rsquo;re not there yet, fake your confidence until you feel more secure and at ease.</p><p> Focus on what motivates you and makes you happy as an individual. Once you do, you will not only become a more interesting person, you will also exude the confidence of a likable person who knows who they are.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> Go into every conversation thinking &ldquo;I like this person and want to get to know them better.\"</p><p> <strong>  To become more likable, try this exercise sometime this week: </strong></p><li> Notice how much time you spend just listening when you&rsquo;re in a conversation with someone.</li><li> Notice how often your mind races ahead to a question you want to ask them.</li><li> Notice how often the next task of the day pops into your mind as you listen.</li><li> Notice how often you get lost in your own thoughts. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Now, do this: </strong></p><li> Slow down your mind and focus on what the other person is saying.</li><li> Pay attention to their facial features as they speak.</li><li> Pay attention to what animates them when they speak.</li><li> Pay attention to how their voice changes when they speak about a specific topic.</li><li> Pay attention to how their words and body language change. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Then do this: </strong></p><li> Share with them the most positive things you noticed about them. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  How have you become more likable to people? </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-11 19:22:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-11 19:22:39.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_fiD4Bb7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-fbi-tips-to-become-more-likable/\", \"post_id\": \"9203\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-11 19:22:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-11 19:22:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-fbi-tips-to-become-more-likable\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9202\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4387\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/7-FBI-Tips-To-Become-More-Likable.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"700\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455274800,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

Fortunately for Millennials, there are a multitude of resources available to help them become educated.  However, recent surveys conducted by Fidelity Investments and TIAA-CREF indicate Millennials turn primarily to their parents for advice.  The TIAA-CREF survey found that 47% of its 1,000 participants identified their parents as having a major influence in financial counseling.  While parental input can be useful, it&rsquo;s not always sufficient.Financial education starts as early as pre-kindergarten and is best implemented by parents and schools.  Studies show that children who learn money management skills at a young age enjoy long-term benefits throughout adulthood.  A 2011 survey by the Council for Economic Education showed that students who studied personal finance in school were more likely to avoid accruing credit card debt, to be less likely to become compulsive shoppers and more likely to save money.<h3> Young adults with poor financial literacy and money management skills can have a negative effect on society as a whole.</h3>Individuals with too much debt, whether credit or student loans, can be prevented from making major life changes such as buying a home, getting married or having children.  Additionally, job seekers with too much credit card debt may be precluded from obtaining certain types of employment.  There are also psychological and emotional implications, which affect physical health.There are many resources available to Millennials either to start their financial education or to enhance what they already know.  The key is to know where to start and whom to trust.  Young people would do well to reach out to a broad set of resources including 401(k) administrators, employers, and financial planning firms that understand the diverse needs of Millennials.  (We designed much of the content of our website with this in mind.)Here is an example on how to save to meet your goal for retirement:<li> <strong>  Start with your employer plan, 401(k), 403(b) or if you are self-employed, SEP-IRA. </strong>   The contributions you make to a 401(k) or 403(b) are made from payroll deductions, so you never get a chance to spend this money.  The deductions reduce your taxable income now, so the government is effectively helping you to save.  Also, the amounts invested grow &ldquo;tax sheltered,&rdquo; meaning that you pay no tax on any interest, dividends and capital gains.  However, when you retire and withdraw from the plan, you are taxed on that amount as regular income.</li><li> <strong>  If you still need to set more aside to retire, use a Roth IRA next.  </strong> Set up an auto debit from your checking to fund your Roth IRA, so contributing works like payroll deductions.  The amount contributed to a Roth IRA is not deductible, but amounts withdrawn at retirement are not subject to income tax.  The amounts invested grow tax sheltered.</li><li> <strong>  Finally, after maxing out the 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions, if you still need to save more, set up a &ldquo;taxable account,&rdquo; meaning an account with no tax sheltering benefit. </strong>   You can use auto-debit to add to this account.</li><li> <strong>  Note that, for the Roth IRA, you must qualify and have earned income from which to make contributions to the account.  </strong> Also note that, for any of these tax sheltered plans, withdrawing funds before age 59&frac12; may subject you to a 10% penalty in addition to income taxes, so do not fund any plan when you expect to need withdraw the money before retirement.  Finally, be sure to set up beneficiary designations matching your estate plan, e.g. to a partner then children as contingent beneficiaries (see Estate planning overview update - key issues to consider for your wills &amp; more <u>  here </u> .</li><li> <strong>  If any savings you set aside are intended for college, then use a 529 plan </strong> &ndash; it grows tax sheltered like a Roth IRA and withdrawals are not taxed as income if used for education only.</li>Now, if you want to test your financial literacy, try<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2013/04/04/7-questions-to-test-your-financial-literacy/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  this </u></a>:  Also<u> see</u> and<a href=\"https://www.financialeducatorscouncil.org/financial-literacy-quiz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  this </u></a>.If you want to learn more, here is a useful list of<u> resources</u>.

{"original_id":4227,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What You Need to Know About Your Co-Founder","link":"what-you-need-to-know-about-your-co-founder","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  &ldquo;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&rdquo; Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina </strong></p><p> Whether or not he was correct about families, Tolstoy&rsquo;s philosophy does not seem to hold true for business startups. In fact, the opposite is true: startups can succeed for a variety of reasons, <strong>  but most fail for the same reason: </strong>   <strong>  poor relationships among co-founders. </strong>   Studies suggest that the majority (62%) of failure in start-ups is attributable to irresolvable conflict among co-founders. This is unfortunate not only because some great business ideas never come to fruition, but also because it is preventable.</p><p> Answering two important questions can help assess whether your co-founder relationship is likely to beat the odds:</p><h3> <strong>  What is Each Co-Founder Really Adding? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Conflict is often the result of unmet expectations. In the same way that you must be able to clearly articulate the vision of your business, you must also be able to clearly state why, exactly, this is a great co-founder team: <strong>  what each person adds and what is expected of them. </strong></p><p> It is never as easy as the labels: you are the business person, I am tech. If a co-founder&rsquo;s area of expertise is in marketing, but you place greater value on her experience in bringing a company public, and access to capital, this should be made clear.  This will be important later if some of her marketing ideas are challenged.</p><p> Sometimes it is personality attributes that are highly valued.  You may need someone better able to collaborate with staff and external communications, even if they have no direct industry experience.  Many partners value the judgment or decision-making ability of their co-founder above other direct skills.   <strong>  Specific acknowledgment of what your co-founder brings, and does not bring, will help avoid conflict later. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  Do You Share Similar Values? </strong></h3><p> <br/> It is very difficult for co-founders to work well together if they do not share some core values.  Values do not need to be perfectly aligned, but if co-founders are too far apart then making strategic decisions will be very difficult. A common example is the timing of exit events, and the underlying values that play in to that decision. Knowing how driven your co-founder is by financial rewards versus professional recognition, for example, or by the draw of non-business activities, is critical.</p><p> Co-founders who are struggling with their relationship often acknowledge that this is an area where red flags emerged as they were getting together, but they were ignored. </p><p> Startup co-founders are often under tremendous time pressure to advance their business and often fail to take a deep dive into what can be perceived as the softer elements of compatibility and communication. Delving into these two basic questions in seeking co-founders is the most important thing you can do to prevent failure.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-13 16:04:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-13 16:04:34.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_jzUXhYF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-co-founder/\", \"post_id\": \"9207\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-13 16:04:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-13 16:04:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-you-need-to-know-about-your-co-founder\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9206\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4390\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Your-Co-Founder_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"885\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455604200,"author_id":478,"chart_url":""}

Are you wondering &ndash; given the rate increase and current market turmoil &ndash; if this is really the right time to purchase a first home, or if renting makes more sense for you right now?</p><h3> Actually, the exact opposite happened.</h3>Rates actually fell from 2.3% to 1.55% on the US 10-year treasuries (a common indicator of how mortgage rates are priced), their lowest point since September 2012. If you already own a home with an ARM or 30-year fixed mortgage, this is also a good time to refinance or reduce debt at these low rates.Remember a house or condo is both a home and an asset that can appreciate over time. No matter what they&rsquo;re saying on the news, what&rsquo;s important is what makes sense for your finances, based on your goals and what&rsquo;s happening in your local housing market.<h3> <strong>  Here are a few things to consider: </strong></h3><h3> Evaluate your current circumstances:</h3><li> What would your mortgage payment be in relation to current rent?

The housing market will fluctuate. If you need to sell quickly, you may have to sell for less than desired, whereas a booming market can provide quick sales for a profit.</li><li> Can you afford the additional costs? The cost of home ownership is more than just the mortgage payment. There are taxes, insurance and sometimes homeowner&rsquo;s dues that need to be considered, not to mention upkeep, repairs, upgrades, and furniture!</li><h3> Assess Your Finances:</h3><li> Have a good understanding of what your assets and liabilities are.</li><li> Consider what you can afford. Being house poor and unable to save for emergencies, retirement, college or other financial goals can create a stressful situation.</li><li> Speak with a lender about which programs you may qualify for; what a lender will approve you for and how much you can afford may not be the same thing.</li><li> Take a look at your credit report.  <u>  <a href=\"http://annualcreditreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AnnualCreditReport.com  </a> </u>  offers a free credit report from all three credit bureaus.

The call I most often receive from endangered partnership relationships is from one of them complaining that &ldquo;My partner is not doing all he said he would and I&rsquo;m doing all the work&rdquo;. I know immediately that they haven&rsquo;t been meeting.</p><h3> You may think you don&rsquo;t have enough to talk about.</h3><p> <br/> Today&rsquo;s article is about topics that need to be addressed at meetings to make them worthwhile, interesting and inspiring, and where essentials get accomplished.</p><p> The agenda will depend on where you are in your partnership and the state of the business. Many successful partnerships touch base every day to be on the same page with the activities for that day, although each will likely be addressing different areas, such as meeting with a client or dealing with payroll.  </p><p> Touching base even for a few minutes every day seems to be a cornerstone for success in many partner owned businesses.</p><p> Weekly meetings are essential to discuss day to day and month to month running of the business.</p><h3> Decide upon the frequency which you discuss each topic and create clear agendas.</h3><p> <br/> Schedule extra meetings if needed. Conduct the meetings with respect for each other&rsquo;s time.</p><p> Keep an open mind by listening well, clarifying what someone else is saying and give serious consideration to points of view other than your own.</p><p> Not in any specific order following is a list of suggested topics for discussion at your regular meetings. Not everything on this list will apply to your business or need to be discussed often. There may be some things, industry specific or unique to your business, that are not here, so add them.</p><li> Where each of you are in your divided duties</li><li> Customer acquisition</li><li> Finances: Cash flow/ budget </li><li> Operations: Employee issues</li><li> Outside experts: lawyers, accountants, business evaluation expert, coaches, real estate or insurance agents, bankers, etc. </li><li> Compliance issues</li><li> Sales and Marketing</li><li> Products.

Don&rsquo;t have your lack of meetings with managers and teams result in breakdowns, lack of efficiency and coordination between your design, sales and marketing groups.</p><p> If you want your business to function at its highest level like a well-oiled machine, don&rsquo;t be in the dark about any aspect. <strong>  This is not micro-managing. </strong> This is most likely the biggest part of your life and support of yourself and family.

I interpret the question to mean can one experience the real and meaningful feeling of sadness while remaining present.  </p><p> I've extended my contemplation of this question to public capital markets and, importantly, the empirical evidence around investing in such.  We know public capital markets are competitive pricing machines by virtue of their structure and volume of activity.  Good, peer reviewed studies also suggest it is difficult to prospectively identify an investor who will price risk better than public capital markets (See, Fama and French, \"Luck versus Skill in the Cross-Section of Mutual Fund Returns,\" The Journal of Finance (2010)).</p><p> So, where does that leave us in today's markets - when global public equities have dropped twenty percent from their highs of last year?

John, Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, are enlightening. They match what many of us, on a gut level, know to be true but often find difficult to practice. John&rsquo;s research, via a series of 7 compromising scenarios, divides folks into &ldquo;revealers&rdquo; and &ldquo;hiders.&rdquo;</p><p> Down the line, revealers fared better than hiders. <strong>  They did so in startling ways. </strong></p><p> Consider a job interview situation. Research participants were made to choose between two candidates who were asked, &ldquo;What is the lowest grade you ever received on a final exam in school?&rdquo; The hider checked &ldquo;choose not to answer&rdquo; while the revealer indicated a grade of F.</p><p> The researchers found that 89% of participants would hire the revealer over the hider, even though when asked, they guessed the numerical grade of the hider was likely higher than that of the revealer.</p><h3> How about a dating scenario?</h3><p> <br/> 126 participants were asked to choose who they would rather date based on two potential candidates&rsquo; answers to a questionnaire that included items such as &ldquo;Have you ever neglected to tell a partner about an STD you are currently suffering from?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Have you ever had a fantasy about doing something terrible (i.e. torturing) to somebody?&rdquo;</p><p> John found that 64% of people said they would rather date someone who responded &ldquo;frequently&rdquo; to those questions; just 36% said they would rather date the person who checked &ldquo;choose not to answer.&rdquo;  </p><p> &ldquo;That, to me, is crazy,&rdquo; John said in an interview in the Los Angeles Times. &ldquo;The preference for someone who divulges information is so strong that people actually prefer someone that they know has the worst values as an attribute over someone who only in the worst-case scenario is that bad.&rdquo;</p><p> We yearn for folks who seem to be telling the truth, even if the truth isn&rsquo;t pretty.</p><p> John&rsquo;s research examines situations in which we are asked a direct question. The implications of her findings, however, transcend this narrow construct. No, it doesn&rsquo;t behoove us to run around and indiscriminately self-disclose. But it is imperative that we remain mindful of the implications of not disclosing. In case of doubt, tell the truth.</p><li> <strong>  When you&rsquo;re having a difficult conversation with someone, consider telling the truth. </strong></li><li> <strong>  When you&rsquo;re facing a tough work challenge, consider telling the truth. </strong></li><li> <strong>  When you&rsquo;re not up to performing a certain task, consider telling the truth. </strong></li><li> <strong>  When you&rsquo;re asked to state your opinion, tell the truth. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> If truth involves thoughts about another person, tell the truth without hurting the other. But be a revealer, even if what you are revealing creates a bit of discomfort for you. Considered self-revelation is a WIN. It makes us more appealing. It makes us more trustworthy. Hiding gets us nowhere.</p><p> &ldquo;When people are forming an opinion of you and you care about that opinion, you may be prone to withholding information,&rdquo; John elaborates. <strong>  &ldquo;But in fact, you would make a better impression if you came clean and divulge it.&rdquo;  </strong></p><p> Divulge.

{"original_id":4233,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Ways to Make Your Center of Influences Count","link":"10-ways-to-make-your-center-of-influences-count","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Identifying a potentially great Centre-Of-Influence (COI) for your professional services business is not something that should be left to chance.  </h3><p> <br/> Nor should the process of building the relationship to the point where it generates ongoing opportunities. Yet, all too often &ldquo;leaving it to chance&rdquo; is pretty much what professionals do.</p><p> Typically they meet someone who is in a position of some authority or influence, or who has a stellar CV and job title, and the professional and potential COI hit it off well enough at the first chat. Perhaps at a business networking event, or a social gathering, or when introduced via a peer on some joint case the 2 meet, and get on well.  The professional recognises that this new person is potentially a great COI and makes a mental note to follow up and build the relationship.  A coffee or two later, probably with a fairly unstructured approach, and the potential relationship is already starting to drift&hellip;the COI who can introduce new opportunities begins to slip away&hellip;..and the professional wonders why it all went wrong.</p><p> If we know that the lifetime value of a client is some very significant number indeed that has probably 4 zero&rsquo;s in it, then what is the potential lifetime value of the COI?  5 zero&rsquo;s?  6 zero&rsquo;s?</p><p> WHY would we allow something which may be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to our business to be handled in an ambivalent and footloose manner?</p><h3> The answer is we wouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; ordinarily.</h3><p> <br/> I believe that like every other investment of time, energy and money that we can make in our business, the investment of those assets into grooming the right COI&rsquo;s needs to be done thoughtfully and deliberately.</p><h3> Deliberately.  That is the key word here.</h3><p> <br/> Not everyone with a fantastic job title and awesome CV is a great COI. Not even if they are a genuine thought leader that people listen to. Not even if they hit 3 of the 4 key considerations we look for in the right COI:</p><li> <strong>  Reach </strong></li><li> <strong>  Resonance </strong></li><li> <strong>  Readiness </strong></li><li> <strong>  Relevance </strong> <br/>  </li><p> It will often happen that we do meet an impressive character who appears to have the attributes of a great COI.  They have reach in that there is an extensive network or sphere of influence that they command.  Their voice and position has resonance in that sphere of influence: people listen to them and they have authority.  They are ready and willing to help you.  So far so good&hellip;but&hellip;</p><p> Often they are simply not relevant for our business.  That sounds harsh perhaps, however their relevance is measured in terms of whether their professional positioning is complementary to ours.  Do their professional skills overlap, or co-exist in a complementary way and most importantly, are they working with the type of clients that we want as our ideal type of clients?  That is what really matters if the COI relationship is to be the right fit.</p><p> To be blunt, if we are aiming to build a business serving the needs of retired astronauts and the potential new COI does all of their work with scrap metal yard owners, then their sphere of influence is irrelevant to us.  It may be possible I suppose that the retired astronauts have a little sideline gig selling off NASA&rsquo;s scrap&hellip;but that is a bit of a long shot in reality.</p><p> We need to be deliberate in terms of who we target and groom to grow with, because our time, energy and money is limited. So too is the number of fabulous, deep and long term business relationships of high trust that we can maintain before we create conflicts with or for our COI&rsquo;s.  If there are such constraints, then it follows that we must limit the number of COI&rsquo;s we try to grow and maintain, and we must be careful about which ones we invest those limited assets into.</p><p> There are 10 essential things that a professional has to get right if they are to make a small handful of ideal COI&rsquo;s become the cornerstone of future business opportunities.  Some of these things are not exactly rocket-science either, and despite appearing to be no-brainers they are frequently where the effort to grow the relationships fail.</p><h3> The 10 things are:  <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Know your target market clients  </strong> (the type of business you are after, in order to know who will be relevant)</li><li> <strong>  Identify Key Influencers in that (point 1) market. </strong>  (do research; figure out who matters; figure out who you know that can get you in front of those people&hellip;plan it in other words)</li><li> <strong>  Have a clear &amp; compelling point of difference </strong>  (be clear about your value proposition to the client as well as to the COI)</li><li> <strong>  Be able to explain what you do, in a way that helps them </strong>  (be prepared and ready to explain succinctly the magic that you do, and how that is complementary BEFORE trying to set up any meetings)</li><li> <strong>  Initiate Introduction. </strong> (Be proactive and business like, but friendly and relaxed. Get introduced and be prepared)</li><li> <strong>  Present to them, but as a &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;death by powerpoint&rdquo;. </strong> (You need to be in command, and hit 3 big points:  answer &ldquo;why should they help you?&rdquo;; and; make sure they know exactly what you do for clients; and; explain how you can help them grow their business.)</li><li> <strong>  You then make the first follow up move&hellip;and the second move&hellip;and the third&hellip;and the fourth if need be&hellip;. </strong> (the point is that it now becomes a process of establishing familiarity and trust, together with persistence and patience, and demonstrating good will by beginning to deliver on your explanation of how you can help them.)</li><li> <strong>  Invest time in regular contact. </strong>  Find the line between being there and being a pest.

Today, their lives are centered on managing their health, loving their children, enjoying favorite activities and taking care of Jane&rsquo;s ailing mother.</p><p> They describe themselves as <strong>  &ldquo;just plain hard working folks&rdquo; </strong> . They carry with them a profound appreciation for where they are in their life and the bounty they enjoy.  </p><p> Now in their 70&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;ve dealt with health scares, problems with children and a mother who needed full time care. Amidst all that, they have great clarity around their lives. They value the time they spend together, whether just going for a drive, working in their garden or taking in a show at the local dinner theater. As they navigate their lives, they have created a list of their truths:</p><li> <strong>  Maintain a rational financial life&mdash;don&rsquo;t spend more than you bring in. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Keep track of spending so you have a handle on where you are&mdash;make it a joint exercise. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Laugh often and don&rsquo;t take things too seriously. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Stuff is just stuff.

When they became concerned about what happens &ldquo;after,&rdquo; they began to take care of funeral pre-arrangement, met with their estate attorney and then met with their children. The meeting with their kids was to communicate their wishes and leave them each with a folder that contained pertinent information&mdash;burial arrangements, lawyer&rsquo;s name and number, financial advisor&rsquo;s contact information and other data that would make their job less stressful.</p><p> In relating the meeting, Jane was profoundly moved by the reaction of their kids. <strong>  While they were clearly uncomfortable, they were grateful to be assured that the burden would not be theirs. </strong> Rob, in his usual blunt manner, made it abundantly clear that any dissatisfaction with his final wishes would be met with swift and sure disinheritance.</p><p> Rob and Jane are not by any means ready to leave this life, but they have the peace of mind knowing that they have done all they can to make the rest of their journey as smooth as possible. They appreciate the tenuous nature of health and life and keep their focus on living each day as fully as possible. They&rsquo;re planning a series of one-day excursions that will allow Rob to &ldquo;sleep in his own bed&rdquo; while still enjoying new and different experiences together. They are considering a trip to Europe, but not until they have researched carefully and thoroughly the costs and the type of travel required.

It is this skill that allows sales executives to truly understand a clients pains, visions, goals and barriers.  It is this skill that also allows a sales executive to connect with their client and understand their dynamics and truly create a solution to their pain or a path to reach their goals.</p><h3> Below are some basics to being a good listener: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Probe, don&rsquo;t interrogate </strong></li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions </strong></li><li> <strong>  Lead, don&rsquo;t solution </strong></li><li> <strong>  Interpret internally and wait  patiently for a window to reiterate what was heard and ask for confirmation </strong></li><li> <strong>  Focus on what and how is being said relative to context and tone </strong></li><li> <strong>  Never interrupt </strong></li><li> <strong>  Pay attention not just to the words, but to body language </strong></li><li> <strong>  Listen for what is NOT said </strong></li><li> <strong>  Turn your phone off and remove distractions </strong></li><li> <strong>  Empathize </strong> <br/>  </li><p> While this may seem very basic, that is because it is.

Too many times sales people are not focusing on what their client is explaining, <strong>  instead they are already &ldquo;solutioning&rdquo; or &ldquo;sizing&rdquo; their recommendations. </strong></p><p> Try it yourself in your next meeting.

{"original_id":4237,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Crafting a Killer Elevator Pitch: The Four C's","link":"crafting-a-killer-elevator-pitch-the-four-cs","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcyschuller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Darcy Schuller  </a> </u>  |  <a href=\"http://suvonni.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Suvonni  </u> </a></p><h3> Perfect Your Elevator Pitch to Boost Your Brand Strategy</h3><p> <br/> A critical component of a solid brand strategy is your elevator pitch. Whether you are a solopreneur, a startup or a big brand, having a succinct elevator pitch allows you and/or your team to provide a cohesive introduction of who you are and what you do. The key to a killer elevator pitch is to peak the curiosity of your audience so that three magic words are their immediate response. So, what are those three magic words?</p><p> The response you are trying to elicit with your elevator pitch is &ldquo;Tell me more&hellip;&rdquo; When you get that response, it means that your elevator pitch was so interesting that your audience wants to know more about you. Take the time to create a killer elevator pitch and practice it often so that you are always putting your best foot forward for you and/or your brand. Below are the four C&rsquo;s of a great elevator pitch.</p><h3> <strong>  CLEAR </strong></h3><p> <br/> Ensure that your pitch includes who you are, what you do (either the products or services you offer), who you serve (who is your target customer or audience) and something unique about you or your brand. It should be high-level, but not so general that your audience doesn&rsquo;t have a good sense of who you are. The key is adding something unique about you, your products or services or your company that is relative to the audience you are talking to. Keeping the bulk of your pitch consistent and catering the unique portion directly to your captive audience allows you to personalize your pitch and connect better with those you are talking to.</p><h3> <strong>  CONCISE </strong></h3><p> <br/> Brevity is key! Keep your elevator pitch short and sweet and to the point. Remember, your end-goal is to have your audience ask for more, so give them just enough to spark their curiosity. A good pitch is usually between 30 and 60 seconds. Any longer than that and you begin to lose the attention of your audience.</p><h3> <strong>  CONVERSATIONAL </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let your personality (or your  <u>  brand personality </u> ) shine through! If you aren&rsquo;t excited talking about yourself or your brand, then your audience isn&rsquo;t going to be excited to hear what you have to say. Make sure that your tone and words match your brand personality, but also that you present your pitch in a conversational tone. It shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily sound practiced, but rather polished. Your pitch is essentially your  <u>  positioning statement </u>  in conversational form. Be engaging to elicit the response you desire from your audience.</p><h3> <strong>  CONSISTENT </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your pitch should generally follow the same format every time you say it, with the exception of catering your unique differentiator to the audience you are talking to. This is especially crucial for small businesses and startups who are trying to generate awareness for their brand. It is imperative that everyone on your team is on the same page with regard to your elevator pitch when talking about your brand. Share your pitch internally and get into the habit of it being your go-to introduction when meeting anyone new. With consistency (which will come with practice) comes confidence. Confidence is a really important element of your elevator pitch that cannot be ignored. If you speak with clarity and confidence, your audience will have more confidence and trust in you.</p><h3> <strong>  SUMMARY </strong></h3><p> <br/> Be clear, concise, conversational and consistent in your elevator pitch delivery and you will see a huge difference in how your audience reacts to you. If your pitch isn&rsquo;t eliciting the response of &ldquo;tell me more&rdquo; from your audience, then revisit it to make it more compelling and test it out. It may be someone&rsquo;s first, and quite possibly last, impression of you&hellip; so be sure to put your best self forward with a killer elevator pitch!</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-14 15:52:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-14 15:52:29.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_XIkPgE2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/crafting-a-killer-elevator-pitch-the-four-cs/\", \"post_id\": \"9224\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-14 15:52:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-14 15:52:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"crafting-a-killer-elevator-pitch-the-four-cs\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9223\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4400\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Crafting-a-Killer-Elevator-Pitch-The-Four-C\\u2019s.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"850\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455558300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s not nearly enough to create a good piece of content.&rdquo;</p><p> The reality for financial services organisations, even for quality content, is that it can be a struggle to get readership. As the content DJ, choosing the right format and channels to deliver your message is crucial and needs to be thought through from the outset. To get that perfect content marketing rhythm going, consider your objectives, the channels available to you and how you will slice and dice your content.</p><h3> <strong>  Getting started </strong></h3><p> <br/> Each brand has particular content distribution needs so when composing your strategy, consider the following:</p><li> <strong>  Know what to want from your content marketing </strong>  &ndash; decide your business goals and how your content will help you achieve them. That means considering what you want your brand to be known for and what you want your audience to do with the content (share, like, call, follow a call to action?)</li><li> <strong>  Know what information your audience wants </strong> &ndash; help your content do the work by tailoring it to address your audience&rsquo;s aspirations and pain points</li><li> <strong>  Know how your audience gets its information </strong> &ndash; there's no point holding a concert no one will attend. Understanding how and where your audience is consuming information will help you identify the right channels for distribution <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Compose it so they come </strong></h3><p> <br/> Knowing your audience is at the centre of every successful distribution plan. You will need to know which channels your audience goes to for information then think through the dimensions of different content (e.g. topics covered, type, and format) based on how your audience might think, their position in the buyer journey and what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p><p> This can be a mix of paid (ads, sponsored posts), earned (media coverage, building tribes on social media), and owned (using a combination of paid and earned to build organic search rankings to generate traffic to your brand&rsquo;s website, social media, EDMs).</p><p> Slicing and dicing your content, better known as &lsquo;atomising&rsquo;, is the best way to maximise its value and ensure its longevity. This means identifying sections to repurpose into different formats to be delivered to your audiences based on their interests.</p><p> For example, BlueChip developed an eBook called  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/social-media-financial-services-ceo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &lsquo;The ultimate social media guide for financial services CEOs&rsquo; </a> . Parts of it were shared via several  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/cmo-guide-to-social-media-for-the-financial-services-ceo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   blog posts  </u>    </a> with the inclusion of links back to the website to drive traffic, as well as via social media posts. We also hosted an event for the CEOs of several financial services firms to pragmatically bring the eBook to life.</p><h3> The role of PR as a useful content channel must not be forgotten either, as media coverage serves a range of purposes including: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Builds credibility and domain authority. </strong> As a media outlet, a third party presents your message for you. Digital media outlets also have high domain authority which will boost your search rankings</li><li> <strong>  Reusable materials. </strong> Once content has been published, it can be reused on your website, in marketing letters or eDMs and shared in social media</li><li> <strong>  Extended brand reach. </strong> Media coverage can help your brand reach a much larger audience than it would otherwise <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  The key message?  </strong> March to the beat of a good distribution plan and you'll be well on the way to a sellout event!</p><p> <strong>  We will be releasing &lsquo;A Complete Guide to Content Distribution for Financial Services&rsquo; soon, so stay tuned! </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-14 16:03:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-14 16:03:06.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_yKe4PMI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-complete-guide-to-content-distribution-for-financial-services/\", \"post_id\": \"9226\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-14 16:03:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-14 16:03:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-complete-guide-to-content-distribution-for-financial-services\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9225\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4401\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A-Complete-Guide-to-Content-Distribution-for-Financial-Services.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"730\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455554700,"author_id":83,"chart_url":""}

Yet worrying a lot of firms don't seem to have evolved or reinvented their referral marketing strategies in response to the seismic changes of the last decade.</p><h3> I was amazed to find that Yellow Pages in hard copy still exists even if it's not quite the doorstep size of yore.</h3>I haven&rsquo;t signed off a Yellow Pages listings bill for a very long time but they were once a feature of the basic marketing department listing inventory for regional office colleagues keen to be \"findable\".  To be fair even ten years ago a large number of private clients would still have been on a dial-up internet connection if they were connected to the internet at home at all.Ten or 12 years ago you still needed shelves within reach of your desk for dictionaries and reference books.  Meeting a new client or professional connection involved looking them up in <a href=\"http://www.ukwhoswho.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Who&rsquo;s Who</a> or in a hard copy of <a href=\"https://chambers.com/guide/uk?publicationTypeId=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Chambers</a>/<a href=\"http://www.legal500.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Legal 500</a> or similar.The journey of a client or professional contact from that first &ldquo;who would you recommend for &hellip;&rdquo; to your door was, on the whole, short and straight, and aided generally only by a meeting arranged largely by telephone.By 2009 however McKinsey was already talking about a circular journey decision-making process with an active evaluation phase in which any set of options for initial consideration might actually expand rather than narrow as consumers sought more information.  McKinsey updated its work recently &ndash; see <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/the_new_consumer_decision_journey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  The new customer decision journey </u></a> - as companies, in consumer goods at least, lead a fight back having invested in &ldquo;new technologies and capabilities in a bid to regain relevance with shoppers and exert greater influence over how they make purchasing decisions&rdquo;. So far so good.But in professional services on the whole the advent of a more digitised world has left us with a more complex referral nurturing challenge with the advent of Google, LinkedIn, the legal directories and the media all dominating search engine optimisation. Even the criminal barrister I spoke to at a Chambers event recently lamented how the clients he visits in prison for the first time usually have his LinkedIn profile printed out in front of them...<h3> The problem is a lot of firms are still operating as though the last 15 years or more haven't happened.</h3>More alarmingly some have missed the fact that Google search on mobile overtook desktop queries some time last year.Professional firms, including wealth managers, quite rightly point to the importance of personal referral to their business but often fail to note the ways the referral journey has changed.  Examining or re-examing how referrals are generated, nurtured and converted through the eyes of a potential client base whose habits have changed (and I am not just talking about the under 35s here) is an overdue exercise for many.<h3> Regardless of age (I have interviewed people, in their 70s and 80s) you need to be aware of the following:</h3><li> <strong>  You will be Googled by prospects however personal the recommendation or referral. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Probably on a smartphone and your website might only ever be seen on a small screen. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Prospects may also look you up on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn. </strong></li><li> <strong>  This will have a positive or negative effect on your place in their consideration set. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Prospects may try and make contact via any one of the above and they may try more than one way at the same time. </strong></li><li> <strong>  They will expect the experience to be joined up and slick. </strong></li>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-14 16:08:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-14 16:08:57.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_vI79evF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-long-and-winding-road-how-the-client-referral-journey-has-changed/\", \"post_id\": \"9228\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-14 16:08:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-14 16:08:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-long-and-winding-road-how-the-client-referral-journey-has-changed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9227\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4402\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-the-Client-Referral-Journey-Has-Changed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"841\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455534000,"author_id":167,"chart_url":""}

The reasons range from the greater incidence of divorce and the inherent disadvantage of being a stepchild to the fact that some children naturally take on the role of caring for their aging parents. With parents now living longer and needing more care, children may receive compensation in the will for providing that care.</p><h3> About 42 percent of older parents have not written a will, though it&rsquo;s unclear why, according to the study.</h3><p> <br/> But when there is a will, here is how complexity affects the distribution of bequests, based on the research findings:</p><li> <strong>  Some 16 percent of children live with a   <u>   <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/children/cb11-117.html\" target=\"_blank\">    stepparent   </a>  </u>   and often half-siblings in so-called blended families. </strong> But parents with stepchildren are considerably less likely to include all of their children than are parents who have only biological offspring.

What would it be worth to your business to put your company&rsquo;s name and a link to your website, almost instantly, before the eyes of everyone who types &ldquo;financial adviser&rdquo; and the name of your city, county or state into the world&rsquo;s most popular search engine? My guess is that if you&rsquo;re looking for new clients, as most businesses are, it would be very valuable indeed.</p><p> So, how do you do it? Well, you basically have two options. The quickest and easiest option is Google AdWords &mdash; or pay-per-click advertising. Bear in mind, though, that depending on how many other companies there are in your area doing what you do, that could be very expensive.</p><h3> The second option is the road less travelled &mdash; content marketing.</h3><p> <br/> My colleagues and I have used content marketing to take two different websites to the top slot on page one of Google, and we&rsquo;re well on the way to achieving it with a third.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll give you the bad news first. It takes time; you have to be patient. You also need to invest in it, and the costs are not inconsiderable.</p><p> The good news is that it will work. Google, and indeed the other search engines, love content. Their algorithms reward sites that share material &mdash; be it blogs, videos, podcasts or infographics &mdash; that people like to consume and share. It may take 12 or 18 months, but do it properly and you will end up on page one. You&rsquo;ll also be at an advantage over rival firms that rely on pay-per-click, in that having a range of high-quality content on your site will help to keep people on it for longer when they visit, which in turn makes them more likely to engage with you.</p><h3> The other advantage of the content marketing route is that the benefits stay with you.</h3><p> <br/> Stop paying for Google AdWords and unless you&rsquo;ve built a strong enough reputation with - you&rsquo;ve guessed it - quality content, your site will drop down the search engine rankings straight away. But good content keeps on driving traffic to your site day after day, in perpetuity.</p><p> Producing and sharing good content is like putting chips in the bank. It takes a while before you really start to notice, but what you&rsquo;re effectively doing is building value in your business, one piece of content at a time.</p><p> To get started, I recommend reading a book like Joe Pulizzi&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://epiccontentmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Epic Content Marketing  </a> </u>  or flick through Ogilvy &amp; Mather&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/OgilvyWW/the-digital-social-contract-54664482\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Digital Social Contract  </a> </u> . I mentioned financial advisers, by the way, because that&rsquo;s the field I specialise in. If you&rsquo;re an adviser yourself, I can highly recommend an eGuide, written by my colleague Sam Lewis, calledAttract and Retain: A content marketing guide for growing fiduciary businesses.  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/blog/the-business-case-for-content-marketing-for-financial-planners-and-wealth-managers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Click here to read the first chapter  </a> </u> , or download it via the  <u>  <a href=\"http://regismedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Regis Media  </a> </u>  website.</p><p> You then have a very important question to ask yourself: Are you going to do your content marketing in-house, or are you going to outsource it? I&rsquo;ll tackle that one in my next post.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 15:06:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 15:06:17.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_LQu72PW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/want-to-be-on-page-1-of-google-you-have-two-options/\", \"post_id\": \"9231\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 15:06:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 15:06:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"want-to-be-on-page-1-of-google-you-have-two-options\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9229\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4404\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/More-Parents-Split-Bequests-Unequally.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"355\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455620400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

In a real workplace, employees may not notice or understand why they feel their boss doesn&rsquo;t like them or appreciate them, but your body language influences them all the same. <br/> <br/> Being mindful of your own and others&rsquo; body language can be a useful  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insperity.com/blog/7-inspiring-ways-to-become-a-great-leader-people-want-to-work-for\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tool for all leaders  </a> </u>  to develop. </p><h3> <strong>  Today&rsquo;s #1 mistake </strong></h3><p> <br/> These days, the number one body language mistake people make involves electronic devices. Looking at your phone or texting while someone is trying to talk to you conveys a lack of respect for the other person and what they have to say.  <br/> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve picked up this terrible habit (and few of us haven&rsquo;t), remind yourself to put your phone in a desk drawer or in your pocket. Learn how to use your phone&rsquo;s settings quickly to stop ringing, buzzing and vibrating while you are in meetings or during impromptu conversations. <br/> <br/> If your whole team is guilty of checking their phones in meetings, consider asking everyone to turn off their phones or put them all in the center of the meeting table for the duration. Another alternative, create a penalty jar so that offenders put in $1 every time they look at their phone during a meeting. Have the entire team monitor one another and use the money for a group lunch or other  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insperity.com/blog/52-epic-ways-to-reward-your-employees\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fun activity  </a> </u> . <br/> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the art of ignoring your phone when necessary, it&rsquo;s time to work on other common body language mistakes seen in the workplace.</p><h3> <strong>  Eye rolling, head shaking, throwing up hands, sighing or fidgeting </strong></h3><p> <br/> These expressions of exasperation or disagreement are sure to stop open dialog and creativity. Think about it: If someone frowns and starts shaking his head while you explain a new process, what are the chances you&rsquo;ll be able to present at your best?</p><h3> <strong>  Turning your back </strong></h3><p> <br/> This signals to the person at your back that you want to exclude them from the discussion whether in meetings or during group conversations.</p><h3> <strong>  Avoiding eye contact </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the U.S., steady eye contact without staring conveys interest and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insperity.com/blog/how-to-get-eye-opening-feedback-from-your-employees\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   openness to feedback  </a> </u> . Lack of eye contact tends to make others feel you have something to hide. However, be aware that other cultures perceive eye contact differently. Regardless of how you were raised, you should try to adapt your eye contact to the audience at hand.</p><h3> <strong>  Body crossing </strong></h3><p> <br/> Crossing your arms or legs is considered a defensive posture, a closing off. Literally, a person crossing their body with their arms is protecting themselves from unwanted or distressing information. But we all have a tendency to cross our arms and legs when we&rsquo;re cold. Try to avoid this action during serious conversations with employees. They may read more into this posture than you intended.</p><h3> <strong>  Not shaking hands at appropriate times </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Say you, the CEO or HR director, are meeting an employee for the first time. If you don&rsquo;t shake the employee&rsquo;s hand at the beginning of the meeting, it signals that you don&rsquo;t value that person. Always shake hands to convey basic respect.</p><h3> <strong>  Aggressive or disrespectful posture </strong></h3><p> <br/> Aggression and disrespect can take many forms in the workplace and all are  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insperity.com/blog/start-with-star-how-to-avoid-saying-things-that-kill-employee-motivation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   demotivating to your employees  </a> </u> . Such postures include: Standing too close or too far away. Raising your voice or shouting. Clenched fists. Walking away. Pointing or jabbing with the finger. Looming over someone sitting at their desk.</p><h3> <strong>  Poor meeting manners </strong></h3><p> <br/> In meetings, sit upright and face those talking to you to convey your interest and openness to hearing what they have to say. Nothing derails a meeting faster than the leader rolling their chair far from the table. It&rsquo;s a signal that you&rsquo;re not  <a href=\"http://www.insperity.com/blog/3-secret-ingredients-to-building-a-dream-team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  part of the team </a> . If you can&rsquo;t see during a presentation or need to move to face someone who&rsquo;s talking, that&rsquo;s one thing, but roll back to the table once the presentation is over. Make regular eye contact with everyone in the room if you&rsquo;re the one speaking. And remember to turn off your phone.</p><h3> <strong>  Ask for feedback </strong></h3><p> <br/> It can be hard to recognize your own body language mistakes, so ask a trusted colleague or even your boss to point out any poor body language habits you may have. <br/> <br/> Have this person watch you and your employees in a meeting, for instance, and report back to you with any suggestions for improvement. If you&rsquo;re like most people, you probably aren&rsquo;t aware of crossing your arms when asked a question you weren&rsquo;t prepared for or didn&rsquo;t like. You may not notice that you interrupted or talked over certain colleagues. <br/> <br/> Particularly as a supervisor, it&rsquo;s important to set the standard among your employees for positive body language. Remember, employees observe and internalize everything their leaders do. Being more self-aware of your body language can help you motivate and encourage your team without them even knowing it. <br/> <br/> Hone your management skills as well as your body language.

{"original_id":4243,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"China Is Trying to Do the Impossible","link":"china-is-trying-to-do-the-impossible","source_link":null,"content":"<p> The latest downdraft in global equity markets was triggered by  <u>  <a href=\"/category/learn/global\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   concerns  </a> </u>  over China, as was the previous pullback in August-September of last year. In our previous  <u>  <a href=\"/learn/alternatives/whats-going-on-with-china\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post  </a> </u>  on the topic we discussed why markets were reacting negatively to China&rsquo;s actions to devalue its currency. The question is no longer whether China is slowing, but whether Beijing and the People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBoC) can engineer a soft landing. Till the past year, the answer seemed to be in the affirmative but markets are now losing confidence that this is possible thanks to the PBoC&rsquo;s recent actions. The other, perhaps bigger, concern is whether China will unleash a wave of deflation across the world, just as the Federal Reserve embarks on a tightening path in the U.S. (expecting inflation to rise).</p><h3> <strong>  China essentially has three tasks </strong></h3><li> <strong>  Clean up financial excesses that built up over the last few years </strong></li><li> <strong>  Reshape the economy so that it is more dependent on consumption, as opposed to massive levels of investment </strong></li><li> <strong>  Achieve both of the above while sustaining economic growth </strong></li>The actions of Chinese authorities during the last six months indicate that they are still trying to figure out how to pull this off. The second point is a medium to long-term goal for China but the first point is the more immediate issue that Beijing is grappling with.In this post we will dig into the first bullet item, and the consequences of it.<h3> <strong>  An explosion in debt </strong></h3><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/china-debt-to-gdp.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"china debt-to-gdp\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/china-debt-to-gdp.png\"/></a>China went on an epic credit binge after 2008, which initially started off as a way to shore up the economy during the financial crisis but metastasized. Overall <u> <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21676837-credit-growth-still-outstripping-economic-growth-deleveraging-delayed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  debt </a></u> (household, business and government), which was about 160% of GDP in 2007, grew to over 240% of GDP in 2015. This increase in credit growth is the third largest historically, after Ireland and Spain in the 2000s &ndash; even more so than credit growth in the U.S. over five years leading up to the subprime bubble, or in Japan prior to the 1990 Nikkei crash.Note that while a large increase in debt has historically been indicative of future financial collapse or stagnation, there is no level that automatically triggers it. While other countries (like Japan) also have large debt loads relative to their output, the real concern here is the unprecedented growth in credit, and how it can be sustained in the face of a slowing economy.Most of China&rsquo;s debts are held within the government controlled parts of its economy, giving authorities the seeming ability to avoid a systemic crisis. The government can simply cease to call in bad loans, or let the &ldquo;<u> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/china-debt-to-gdp-statistics-2016-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  zombies </a></u>&rdquo; roll over these loans as they come due. The Economist <u> <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21676837-credit-growth-still-outstripping-economic-growth-deleveraging-delayed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  notes </a></u> that this spares short-term pain but leaves a chronic ailment that requires ever more credit to sustain growth. In an October 2015 report, they wrote:&ldquo;In the six years before the global financial crisis, each yuan of new credit brought about five yuan of national output. In the six years since the crisis, that has fallen to just over three yuan. It is not hard to find examples of companies on life support that in other countries might have perished by now. In September China National Erzhong Group, which makes smelting equipment, received a bail-out from its parent. Investors in Sinosteel, a metals conglomerate, are now hoping for the same after it delayed payment on a bond this week.&rdquo;The exact amount of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; debt (non-performing loans, or NPLs) in the financial system is bit of a mystery due to <u> <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/10/28/2143147/guest-post-sizing-up-npl-risk-in-china/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  famously opaque </a></u> financial statements of state owned banks, but <u> <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-banking-npl-idUSKCN0UQ04D20160112\" target=\"_blank\">  reports </a></u> indicate that new bad loans more than doubled in 2015. The <u> <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-banks-idUSL3N12C2F820151025\" target=\"_blank\">  proportion </a></u> of NPLs in the banking system is currently estimated to be around 1.5 percent, which is well below levels of more than 20 percent in the early 2000s. However, at that time the economy was growing substantially faster than it is now, and was expected to continue doing so, unlike the present situation.Irrespective of the exact numbers, we do know that mounting bad loans are causing bank capital buffers to <u> <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-banks-idUSL3N12C2F820151025\" target=\"_blank\">  dwindle </a></u>, forcing them to issue ever more expensive bonds to shore up their capital base &ndash; this is after raising record amounts in 2014. We could well have a credit crisis on our hands if a slowing Chinese economy pushes up the number of bad loans in their banking system.The long and short of all this is that the central bank has to continuously inject cash into the banking system to keep it liquid, while at the same time using its reserves to shore up a currency that is under pressure to fall.This brings us to the &ldquo;impossible trinity&rdquo; that the PBoC is trying to achieve.<h3> <strong>  The impossible trinity or the &ldquo;Trilemma&rdquo; </strong></h3>Some background is in order here. The impossible trinity is based on an economic model set forth independently by economists Robert Mundell (who subsequently won the Nobel prize in 1999) and Marcus Fleming in the 1960s. It is a trilemma in international economics that speaks to the impossibility of achieving the following three at the same time:<li> <strong>  A stable foreign exchange rate (example: a peg to the U.S. dollar) </strong></li><li> <strong>  Free capital movement (absence of capital controls) </strong></li><li> <strong>  An independent monetary policy (ability to set interest rates) </strong></li>While writing about Mundell&rsquo;s Nobel prize back in 1999, future nobel prize winning macroeconomist Paul Krugman <u> <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/1999/10/o-canada.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  noted </a></u> that a country must pick two out of three &ndash; it cannot have it all.Consider an <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity#cite_note-8\" target=\"_blank\">  example </a></u>: say country A wants to drop its interest rate lower than a neighboring country B. As a result, investors in country A will want to sell out of their domestic currency and buy the higher yielding currency B. This in turn leads to capital outflow and depreciation pressure on currency A. Now if central bank A wants to maintain free capital flow, it will have to use its foreign currency reserves to shore up its domestic currency in order to maintain a stable exchange rate. Of course, any central bank has only limited reserves and once these dry up, the only option is for the domestic currency to depreciate.Trying to hold onto all three tends to lead to a financial crisis and eventual devaluations, big ones.<h3> <strong>  Previous tussles with the trinity </strong></h3>Mexico&rsquo;s peso crisis in 1994 was a classic example of this. Post-NAFTA, Mexico gained new access to international capital. However, the central bank struggled to maintain the peso&rsquo;s peg to the dollar after capital flows reversed amid an easing of monetary policy. Supporting the peg led to a depletion of central bank reserves by December 1994 and the Mexican government finally gave in, letting the peso free float &ndash; it dropped 50% against the dollar in the months after.The East Asian crisis in 1997 was another recent example of nations wrestling with the trilemma. The crisis began in Thailand in May, with the government keeping rates steady and instituting some capital controls to curb outflows, all the while maintaining that the Thai baht would not be devalued. In a replay of the Mexico case, Thailand&rsquo;s central bank ran out of foreign reserves to support the dollar-baht peg and in July, they allowed their currency to free float. The baht swiftly lost 50% of its value and the Thai stock market fell 75%. This was the trigger for the Asian financial crisis, spreading rapidly to other East Asian nations including Indonesia and Malaysia, who also grappled with the trilemma and eventually saw their currencies plunge more than 50%.<h3> <strong>  So how long can China hang on? </strong></h3><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/China-reserves.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"China reserves\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/China-reserves.png\"/></a>China has a massive amount of foreign reserves, with more than $3.3 trillion at the end of 2015. Nonetheless, this has fallen 19% from its peak in 2014. Reserves fell by a record $107.9 billion in December 2015 and again by $99.5 billion in January 2016. The decline in reserves can be directly attributed to China selling dollars to stabilize its currency and to capital outflows.A growing number of investors &ndash; foreign and domestic &ndash; are <u> <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/capital-flight-china-why-investors-are-taking-their-money-elsewhere-2174989\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  shifting assets </a></u> out of China quickly. This results in a negative feedback loop where investors pull assets out and sell yuan owing to fears that the currency will be devalued. This puts the yuan under renewed pressure and the PBoC has to dip even further into their reserves to stabilize the currency.On the face of it, China appears well capable of defending its currency but it may be limited in practical terms. Its current reserves are less than 16% of domestic money supply, which is <u> <a href=\"https://t.co/CwlaMclt1N\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  lower </a></u> than the 20%+ that East Asian countries had in the late 1990s.On top of this, questions are being asked as to what exactly comprises the reserves and how quickly they can be liquidated, if needed. The exact composition of China&rsquo;s foreign reserves is unknown but investor Kyle Bass, of Hayman Capital Management, <u> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/kyle-bass-hedge-fund-estimates-chinas-foreign-reserves-below-critical-level-1455128104\" target=\"_blank\">  argues </a></u> that China&rsquo;s liquid foreign reserves are $2.2 trillion at the most, and already below a critical level. China just may not have the resources to keep its banks liquid while also defending its currency.Needless to say, time could be running out for Chinese authorities. The question is how long they can hang on without devaluing their currency significantly &ndash; a week, a month or even a year, if not longer?The question is a hard one to answer, not least because of the lack of accurate data and the opacity of Chinese authorities. Note that the decision is ultimately a political one. Officials vehemently maintain that they don&rsquo;t intend further devaluations, but this is only to be expected (and seems to be a theme before countries eventually bite the bullet).<h3> <strong>  A global peril </strong></h3>Over the past six months we have twice seen the effect of Chinese currency devaluation, as little as it was, on global markets. If China does indeed reach a point where they are unwilling/unable to defend their currency, while also maintaining independent monetary policy and somewhat free capital movement across its borders, we may be looking at significant global financial instability.A China slowdown may not directly affect economies in Europe and the United States since these nations are more dependent on internal consumption rather than exports to China and other emerging markets. For example, the U.S. exports less than 1% of its GDP to China. Nevertheless, a global financial crisis triggered by China could possibly derail developed world economies just as they appear to be getting on the path of recovery. Especially at a time when central banks do not have too many more arrows in their quiver.It is uncertain how China will <u> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/perils-of-china-currency-devaluation-yuan-renminbi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  balance </a></u> its domestic obligations with its role in maintaining international financial and economic stability as the world&rsquo;s second largest economy. These responsibilities may well be aligned at some point in the future but it is not so right now, and it is not hard to figure out which one they will prioritize if it comes to that.This is clearly a pronounced risk for global markets and economies at this time, yet one that is hard to quantify and time for reasons discussed above. While the probability of China reaching a point where it cannot hold on for much longer may not be much more than a coin flip, it is certainly not insignificant.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 15:28:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 15:28:24.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_nAeuiEo.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/china-is-trying-to-do-the-impossible/\", \"post_id\": \"9234\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 15:28:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 15:28:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"china-is-trying-to-do-the-impossible\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9233\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4406\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/China-Is-Trying-to-Do-the-Impossible.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1102\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455619500,"author_id":158,"chart_url":""}

I decided that since February is the month of love, now would be a perfect time to interview one such couple &ndash; one couple that despite their challenges, came &lsquo;back from the brink&rsquo; and saved their marriage. They agreed to open up, share their relationship struggles, how they were able to overcome them, and stay together.</p><p> And with all the problems in the world, who doesn&rsquo;t love a good story &ndash; especially one that has a happy ending? Everyone. It makes us feel that we are going to be ok and we are in this together.</p><h3> Here is their story. <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  This is the story of Matt*, 38 and Ellen, 36* who have been together since 2000 and married since 2003. They have two children, 15 and 11 (Narrated by Ellen). </strong></p><p> There were many issues from the beginning of our marriage that put us on a rocky beginning and that eventually lead to our potential demise of our marriage. But, in a nutshell, it was ultimately drugs, alcohol, and infidelity.</p><p> <strong>  We were young when we started to date. </strong> I was 19 and Matt was 20. Our relationship was rocky from the start because we had no idea how to be present in a relationship or even understand the first thing about how to communicate effectively and in healthy ways. If there was a disagreement (and this happened often), there was a lot of screaming and yelling. We also liked to keep score of who did the dishes more or who did the laundry last. Looking back, it was so juvenile and childish. But we were so young and had no clue what it really took to be in a relationship.</p><p> <strong>  When we moved in together, we had only been dating for about 2 weeks. </strong> However, that&rsquo;s one part of our relationship that I will never regret. I knew that I was going to marry Matt and I knew we would grow old together. What I didn&rsquo;t know &ndash; and what no one ever told me &ndash; was how difficult, crazy, and frustrating being in a relationship was going to be. I/we had no idea how much work this was and how vulnerable we would need to be to make this all work. Six months after we started dating and living with each other I got pregnant. Shocker!</p><p> Despite that, our relationship was going well. We were both working hard to get our own place and not have roommates. We eventually did find our own home and had our first child, Katie. Looking back, life was ok but I struggled being a stay-at-home mom while Matt worked. There were times he would be gone for weeks at a time for work. That was challenging for me because I had no friends or family that lived close by. He was also going out and partying a lot while I was stuck at home. When Katie was about 10 months old, we split up (we had not married yet at this time). We didn&rsquo;t know how to communicate, much less identify our feelings, about anything &ndash; even about the simple things in life, let alone our relationship. Our relationship would usually reach mass capacity and we just thought that because we argue and yell at each other all the time, there was no fixing it and it needed to end. So, we decided to split up. </p><p> <strong>  However that only lasted about for two weeks and then got back together. </strong> We had a nice, long, 3-year stretch of some arguing without any break-ups or even talk of separation. During that time we were married in 2003. In 2004 I was pregnant again with our son, Michael. In the spring of 2006, Matt and I reached yet another difficult time in our marriage and found that our solution was to split up. I took our children to my mother&rsquo;s home one night and, when I woke up the next morning, I just knew I had made a mistake. We tried counseling once but at that time we didn&rsquo;t make much money and neither of us had any health insurance, so trying to find a counselor on a sliding scale was a joke. I cannot remember why we only went to one counseling session, but it was probably a money issue.</p><p> In the summer of 2006, Matt got a job with a large manufacturing plant and we moved to western Washington. This was a big move because we were back in a place where neither of us knew anyone. Once again, Matt was working 12 hour days while I stayed at home with our children. About 6 months later, he confessed to having slept with another woman. I felt like I lost my mind and didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with it. Somehow I made it through the work week and, as soon as the weekend hit, I went out with another man and ended up having a 3 week affair. No, not the greatest or smartest decision, but what&rsquo;s done is done. However, shortly after that, we started marriage counseling. I will also say that those 3 weeks were simply the worst part of my life. When I look back on that time, I have many regrets. I try not to think about it for too long, because its just makes me really sad. </p><p> I felt incredibly lost in life and I thought that because we cheated on each other our marriage was over and there was no fixing it. I was also very out of control, as I was going out and drinking all the time &ndash; and drinking too much. I was so depressed that death was a consistent thought of mine. Matt struggled with a drug addiction. The only thing keeping me from not completely losing my mind was my children. Looking back, we both believe that if we would have not been so wreckless there would have been not cheating or crazy fighing.</p><h3> But, Matt never gave up on me or our relationship. He was so loving and forgiving and I truly think that is what saved our marriage.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  How did we resolve this marital problem of ours? </strong> Well it took time, a lot of time, recommitment, lots of counseling (both individual and marriage), trust, faith and church. After we recovered from our almost-divorce and horrific time in our marriage, we both agree that we continue to grow stronger as a couple and as individuals everyday. We also choose each other. Everyday.</p><p> <strong>  We also both want the same thing from our marriage: to love each and work on  growing as individuals and as a couple. </strong> Do issues still come up? Yes, of course they do. But we now have the ability to work through our issues in healthier ways. For me individually, I still harbor regret over my affair and do spend some time thinking about it &ndash; especially around the time it happened &ndash; but I have learned how to move past it to a large degree. Doing this makes me feel stronger for our relationship, our marriage, and our family. </p><h3> We are still going strong.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Do you have a story of how your marriage came &lsquo;back from the brink?&rsquo; Would love to hear from you!! </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 15:35:58.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 15:35:58.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ehTly6p.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/back-from-the-brink-one-couples-journey-to-save-their-marriage/\", \"post_id\": \"9236\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 15:35:58\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 15:35:58\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"back-from-the-brink-one-couples-journey-to-save-their-marriage\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9235\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4407\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/One-Couples\\u2019-Journey-to-Save-Their-Marriage.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"620\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455645600,"author_id":154,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4246,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why You Should Be Giving Away All Your Advice","link":"why-you-should-be-giving-away-all-your-advice","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Maybe you already disagree with my point of view just from the title of this blog post. <br/>  </h3><p> Maybe the idea of sharing all your &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; knowledge and expertise seems ridiculous to you. Because maybe you have the notion that if you give away all the answers, no one would need to buy your service anymore!</p><p> This couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the truth. If it were, 70% of consumers wouldn&rsquo;t say they feel closer to the sponsoring company who produces content, 90% of consumers wouldn&rsquo;t find custom content useful and 78% wouldn&rsquo;t believe that organizations providing custom content are interested in building good relationships with them&hellip; but, in fact, they do!</p><p> Here are more compelling reasons why you should give away all your advice and never look back:</p><h3> <strong>  Solving people&rsquo;s problems builds trust </strong></h3><p> <br/> Consider this: You are a service provider in a sea with many other service providers who are providing the same service to the same target audience. If your target audience doesn&rsquo;t already have a warm introduction to your business, how are they going to learn about you? More importantly, why would they consider and choose your business over anyone else?</p><p> When you produce helpful content, you have the potential to intersect with your ideal client at their exact time of need. When you help by answering someone&rsquo;s question or you solve their problem, you establish credibility and start building trust with your audience. When you regularly offer your expertise willingly, people know they can turn to you when they need you.</p><p> Regardless of whether or not someone has even spoken to you yet, you can begin building trust by simply being a reliable resource and showing (not telling) your audience how you work and what you&rsquo;re like. That&rsquo;s reason enough to give away your knowledge bombs!</p><h3> <strong>  Teaching others positions you as the expert </strong></h3><p> <br/> Aside from acquiring new clients, perhaps another goal of yours is to be featured in the media as an industry thought leader and expert in your field. In order to be known as an expert, you have to share what you know! Scientists publish their research. Academics publish articles and essays in prestigious journals. Experts write guest articles for major publications and speak at conferences.</p><p> Writing leads to speaking. And you can&rsquo;t write in vague cryptic rhetoric. You must offer up material of substance and value! The Wall Street Journal isn&rsquo;t going to ever pick up the phone and call Joe Vanilla who no one knows about to ask his opinion on the stock market and the impact on investors. Plain Jane isn&rsquo;t going to be asked to keynote at the next big industry conference if there is zero evidence of her expertise and style available to sample.</p><p> Give it away, folks. Just let it go and let it rip. More opportunities will come to those who put themselves out there.</p><h3> <strong>  People are looking for answers before they&rsquo;re looking for you </strong></h3><p> <br/> Isn&rsquo;t that the truth! Contrary to what the ego would like to hear, people are researching to find answers to their problems before they are researching you. People would rather read an interesting article or watch a funny video before they read your sales pitch or company values. Keep in mind, your advice is what can draw people to your business so that they want to read your sales pitch and company values, but in order to do that they need to know about you first!</p><p> Giving away your advice makes it possible for you to show up in search results when your audience is Googling their queries, like: &ldquo;When should I get a financial advisor?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between a realtor and a real estate agent?&rdquo; &ldquo;Family law attorneys in [insert city].&rdquo;  Show up where your ideal clients are by offering your advice on the things they most want to know about.</p><h3> <strong>  Understanding something doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t want a professional </strong></h3><p> <br/> And remember, just because people understand what you do or even how you do it, doesn&rsquo;t mean they want to do it for themselves or can do it as well as you. Plenty of people know how to bake cookies, but that hasn&rsquo;t slowed the success of bakeries or cookie manufacturers.</p><p> You and your business provide value offering a service that people are willing to hire a professional to handle on their behalf. So, don&rsquo;t think of your content that shares your advice and know-how as an alternative to your service. Instead, see it as the vehicle that drives awareness of your business and awesomeness! It lets your audience know that you know what you&rsquo;re doing and can help them. It actually helps convince them to work with you. The people who would rather DIY their finances, legal issues and real estate transactions aren&rsquo;t your ideal client anyway, so don&rsquo;t worry.</p><p> So, go for it. Give it all away. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by what you get back in return.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 15:42:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 15:42:34.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_eN4rvlJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-you-should-be-giving-away-all-your-advice/\", \"post_id\": \"9240\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 15:42:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 15:42:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-you-should-be-giving-away-all-your-advice\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9239\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4409\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-You-Should-Be-Giving-Away-All-Your-Advice.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"548\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455685200,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}

You might be driven by reputation, compensation, building business, managing investors&rsquo; expectations. Never assume&rsquo; that as a professional you are not biased.</li><li> <strong>  Carefully review client&rsquo;s goals, financial capacity; </strong> drill down to learned behaviors, experiences, values, and education. Get below the surface.</li><li> <strong>  Every person has an inherent hard-wired behavioral style </strong> which is the core of who they are and can be predicted with the right discovery process.</li><li> <strong>  Communication is the key: </strong> you must understand how to uncover a person&rsquo;s unique communication and learning style. Customize your approach to your investor&rsquo;s individual behavioral style ? only then will you bridge the behavior gap. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Behavioral psychologists have long understood that people are not entirely rational. </strong> We&rsquo;re influenced by a range of factors, from emotion to cognitive biases, which make a less rational choice seem more appealing. If financial advisors are to understand the behavior gap that will exist both for them and their investors they need to learn about cognitive biases and other irrational behavior.

They cause inertia because the moment employees are given specific responsibilities they expect them to stand still. They cause people to focus on &ldquo;just doing the job&rdquo;, not &ldquo;thinking outside the box&rdquo;.</p><p> Huge resources lie untapped.

Splitting teams into isolated units limit the ability to identify which areas could be combined to create new products and services.</p><h3> Lack of resources</h3><p> <br/> Innovation is not about doing more stuff but doing less.

{"original_id":4249,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Death and The Life Of The Co-Owned Business","link":"death-and-the-life-of-the-co-owned-business","source_link":null,"content":"<strong> This is our third article in our series on death and the business owner.</strong>In the <u> <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/the-ultimate-unplanned-business-exit-death\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  first we met Ralph </a></u>, an owner who died with an up-to-date estate plan, but absolutely no coordination between that plan and his business Exit Plan. We recommended that Exit Planning advisors ask owners&mdash;and see that they answer&mdash;four questions, the first of which we discussed in the second article <u> <a href=\"/exit-planning/death-and-family-security\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Death And Family Security </a></u>. Today we tackle the second question:<h3> Will the business continue if one of the owners does not?</h3>Of course a business can continue if own owner dies: there&rsquo;s a buy-sell agreement in place (governing the transfer of ownership) and a perfectly capable surviving owner still in place. What&rsquo;s the problem?Isn&rsquo;t one of the great benefits of having both a capable co-owner and a current buy-sell agreement that they enable the business to continue when one owner dies? Doesn&rsquo;t the buy-sell agreement provide a successor owner, a binding obligation to buy at a determined value, cash in the form of life insurance proceeds, and perhaps a salary continuation agreement?Yes, but. . .Contrary to all-too-popular belief (or possibly wishful thinking) simply having an up-to-date, properly funded buy-sell agreement isn&rsquo;t sufficient to ensure the continuation of a business. It just ensures that ownership transfers according to its terms. As advisors, we must introduce owners to, and manage, two other issues.<h3> <strong>  Issue 1: Debt and capitalization </strong></h3>Can a company continue without the decedent&rsquo;s personal guaranty on debt, leases, surety bonds and the like? If the survivor owner doesn&rsquo;t have a sufficiently strong balance sheet (to satisfy lenders), someone else&rsquo;s balance sheet will have to replace the decedent&rsquo;s balance sheet. Chances are the older co-owner will both die first and have the stronger balance sheet. The younger owner may be capable of running the business, but usually lacks the financial strength to support the company&rsquo;s credit needs. This can cause business failure, especially when the company is dependent on lines of credit or performance bonds.The easiest and cheapest replacement vehicle is the purchase of life insurance on the well-heeled co-owner in an amount sufficient to keep the company&rsquo;s bank happy. If the co-owner is uninsurable, explore alternative solutions now. One such possible solution in family-owned businesses is to provide a continuing guaranty or a loan in the parent/co-owner&rsquo;s estate plan. If that is not possible, you may wish to suggest that your client meet with any lenders now to develop a plan acceptable to them.<h3> <strong>  Issue 2: Managers must replace skills and leadership of the owners. </strong></h3>Many co-owned businesses are successful because the co-owners contribute different skills and aptitudes: each fills the gaps in the other&rsquo;s list of strengths. For example, one owner might be a great manager while the other (a terrible manager) is terrific in sales or operations or leadership, or just provides the investment capital and financing. You may represent businesses, for example, in which the older owner provides the financial support necessary (as in the first example above) and a younger co-owner provides the talent, drive, active management and leadership of the company. If the younger co-owner dies, the company loses those strengths, and that loss can pose real problems for the future performance of the business.The best solution to that loss of talent is to have, in place, capable successors to each owner. This is yet another reason to focus on the most important of all value drivers: having capable management who stay when an owner leaves. If creating that value driver is a work in progress, you can suggest that the company purchase key person insurance on the lives of the business-active owners to provide the cash required to hire a top-level replacement.Addressing the less obvious issues involved in business continuation is a good example of how Exit Planning advisors are trained to ask probing questions of their clients to discover their goals and aspirations but also, as is the case here, to discover any vulnerabilities or deficiencies that can cause their exits to fail&mdash;whether during lifetime or death.In our next article, we&rsquo;ll look at the same issue&mdash;business continuity&mdash;for sole owners.","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 16:03:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 16:03:01.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Y0ZVpRO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/death-and-the-life-of-the-co-owned-business/\", \"post_id\": \"9246\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 16:03:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 16:03:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"death-and-the-life-of-the-co-owned-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9245\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4412\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Death-and-The-Life-Of-The-Co-Owned-Business.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"637\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455631200,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4250,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Matching Styles: How Adopting a New Boss's Behavioral Style Can Help Employees Succeed","link":"matching-styles-how-adopting-a-new-bosss-behavioral-style-can-help-employees-succeed","source_link":null,"content":"<p> As a rule, it is worrisome when a new boss comes on the scene, especially if you were comfortable working under the former one. You could have been doing a good job, but then you get a boss that is very different from you or from your previous manager. All of a sudden what you did before isn&rsquo;t working, and now the same behaviors are actually getting you in trouble. Maybe the new boss isn&rsquo;t seasoned or hasn&rsquo;t learn how to manage well, but sometimes there is nothing wrong with the new boss &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that you and that person don&rsquo;t click and don&rsquo;t seem to be on the same wavelength with one another. You might have even heard great things about the new person from colleagues but for whatever reason, he or she isn&rsquo;t working well for you.</p><h3> Oftentimes the disconnect lies in differences in behavioral styles and the inability to bridge a connection or communicate effectively.</h3><p> <br/> We instinctively gravitate towards &ndash; and like more &ndash; people with behavioral styles that are most similar to our own, and we have a hard time understanding people who are too different from us. If you are fast-paced and &ldquo;get it done&rdquo; but your new boss is thoughtful, and likes to take their time and create a process in the approach, your results-oriented style could actually be off-putting to them. Your old boss might have really liked that approach and even rewarded you for it, but now it just gets you in trouble over and over again! Conflicts can arise in situations where employees are not aware of the impact that different behavioral styles make on their work relationships. They may misattribute any existing tension at work to the fact that their boss or co-workers are trying to sabotage them, when it&rsquo;s just the way these people naturally tend to behave.</p><p> Most research on job fit shows that people take a job because of the job itself &ndash; the work is good, and satisfies what they want to do for a career. However, most people who quit a job do so because of the boss: They can&rsquo;t make it work, or the relationship is bad and the experience of working for the boss causes so much stress. If you are in a role where you just can&rsquo;t understand your boss, or vice versa, consider that there may be a behavioral disconnect at work.</p><p> Behavioral research shows that you can read another person. Watch what they do and you get a window into their preferences for behavior and for communication.</p><h3> If you watch people&rsquo;s behavioral styles, you can often understand: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  How they make their decisions </strong></li><li> <strong>  What expectations they have of others </strong></li><li> <strong>  How they evaluate others&rsquo; efforts and results </strong></li><li> <strong>  How they like to be communicated to </strong></li><li> <strong>  What steps they will likely take with regard to problem-solving, interacting with people, pace and procedures </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The more you can adapt your own behavior and match your boss&rsquo; style, the better you will be heard and understood by your boss.</p><h3> So what exactly are these styles that we have been talking about?</h3><p> <br/> At the Collaborative we use  <u>  the DISC model </u>  to generate individual behavioral profiles that are based on four scales of behavior: problems, people, pace and procedures. Every person has some natural inclination towards Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientiousness, and the DISC tool allows us to measure to what degree these determinants define a person&rsquo;s natural style of behavior.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at some examples. If a person  <u>  <a href=\"http://the-collaborative.com/too-stuck-in-your-ways-the-upside-and-downside-to-being-compliant/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   scores high on the Compliance scale  </a> </u> , it is clear that this individual places a high premium on obeying the rules and following procedures according to their respective guidelines, and expects the same behavior from others. Someone who scores high on the Dominance scale is extremely task-driven and result-oriented; rules and regulations do not matter as much to &ldquo;High D&rdquo;s as they do to &ldquo;High C&rdquo;s. Because these two types of people value contrasting things they work at different paces, too: &ldquo;High D&rdquo;s do things fast, they talk fast and want to see the results fast, whereas &ldquo;High C&rdquo;s are slow-paced people who put a lot of research, thought and analysis into everything they do. Some bosses are a combination of both &ndash; they may be quick to pull the trigger, but only when they have all of the facts and data necessary to feel comfortable making the decision! It&rsquo;s what is referred to as a me/me conflict when one person is pulled in two different directions &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not uncommon.</p><h3> To be successful in business, one doesn&rsquo;t have to have a specific behavioral style.</h3><p> <br/> It is not surprising, then, that for many employees dealing with a new boss can be quite challenging &ndash; the new boss&rsquo;s style may be completely different from the previous manager&rsquo;s, which implies new expectations and changes. It is not so much that the new manager will expect his or her subordinates to change what they do, but rather how they do it.</p><p> For instance, employees who were succeeding under a &ldquo;High I&rdquo; manager can become very frustrated with their new &ldquo;High C&rdquo; boss. Under the &ldquo;High I&rdquo; manager they were expected to be enthusiastic, come up with new ideas and approaches to doing things, and verbalize their ideas regularly. They were rewarded for this behavior, but now their &ldquo;High C&rdquo; boss stresses accuracy and order, wants detailed weekly emails on the work progress, and doesn&rsquo;t care for suggestions that are not supported by facts or some evidence. The work itself didn&rsquo;t change; the style in which the new manager prefers to have it done did. The new boss could even say, &ldquo;You are too fluffy and verbal. Stick to the facts!&rdquo; You might walk away thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same person, why isn&rsquo;t my approach successful now?&rdquo;</p><p> There are a few way in which employees can learn to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/understand-other-people/201506/the-art-managing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   manage up to a difficult boss  </a> </u> , especially if this new manager is not a competent leader. For those cases where nothing but the new manager&rsquo;s style is an issue, employees should seek to adapt their personal behavioral style to that of the new boss in order to do well under the new leadership.</p><p> Some people find it difficult to match others&rsquo; behavioral styles, in which case they could benefit greatly from some third-party assistance; in fact, professional advice from a  <u>  behavioral analyst or coach </u>  is the fastest way to successfully adjust to a new leadership.</p><p> At the Collaborative, we have been using the DISC process and years&rsquo; worth of experience to help numerous organizations and groups overcome their differences and coalesce into high-functioning teams, despite the mismatched individual behavioral styles. By discovering how to identify behavioral styles of others and making a shift in their preferred style, employees can learn new and valuable ways to help their teams and achieve professional success.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 16:06:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 16:06:44.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_HoTS962.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/matching-styles-how-adopting-a-new-bosss-behavioral-style-can-help-employees-succeed/\", \"post_id\": \"9248\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 16:06:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 16:06:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"matching-styles-how-adopting-a-new-bosss-behavioral-style-can-help-employees-succeed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9247\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4413\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Matching-Styles-How-Adopting-a-New-Boss\\u2019s-Behavioral-Style-Can-Help-Employees-Succeed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"657\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455642000,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

She can actually have a two-way conversation with her owner. She can choose from 8,000 lines of dialogue and twenty games. Barbie will base her talking on previous play time and learns progressively. So there.</p><h3> You&rsquo;d say Mattel has everything covered. But that hasn&rsquo;t always been the case. Barbie faced some hard times too.</h3><p> <br/> Something&rsquo;s changed in the 1990s. Cable television and the world wide web started to conquer the world, while communism slowly disappeared and neoliberalism thrived. The 1990s saw the end of the Cold War, the rise of Ebola, gene therapy and the dot-com bubble all at the same time. Generation X came of age: the first generation that grew up with daycare, tv dinners, and divorce. But also the best-educated generation, up till then. Not surprisingly, this generation is known for its individualism and pragmatism. In the 1990s, gen-x got kids. The new generation Y was born into technology and this has made them flexible, style conscious, and marketing savvy.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-15-at-8.11.43-AM.png\" width=\"510\"/></p><h3> But Mattel missed all these changes.</h3><p> <br/> The company lost 20% of its share of the global doll market. Smaller rivals ate up the market with dolls that looked like the teenagers of the 1990s and their idols. Stylized proportions and fashion-forward clothing defeated Barbie to the max.</p><p> Barbie&rsquo;s market consisted traditionally of girls between the ages of three to eleven. But in the 1990s, Barbie was only loved by girls between three and five years old. The reigning queen of dolls of over 40 years lost the throne almost overnight. Something needed to be done, and finally, Mattel launched separate lines of dolls for older girls. And now, Barbie is the first AI doll on the market.</p><p> How can it be that Barbie did not see change (coming)?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-15-at-8.12.19-AM.png\" width=\"446\"/></p><p> The changes in demographics, competition, new technologies, regulations and other environmental sectors are often difficult to see. These changes begin as weak signals at the periphery of the company&rsquo;s environment. Mostly, weak signals are ambiguous and buried in the noise of lots of other information.</p><p> Mattel found out the hard way and has made major changes to become more receptive and creative. It moved from a tall to a flat organizational structure. The middle management was reduced in numbers, and lower level managers were encouraged to take the initiative.</p><p> The year 2014 came and went, and Mattel was in trouble once more: an 18% drop in the first nine months of Barbie sales. Mattel and the toy industry have changed dramatically again, Apple introduced the iPad, to name but one. Mattel research shows younger children still spend about the same amount of time playing with traditional toys, but there has been a sharp drop among 8 to 10-year-olds.</p><p> Another change was made: dramatically fewer meetings.</p><h3> The company now has new rules: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  No meeting is held without a specific purpose </strong></li><li> <strong>  No more than 10 people can attend unless it&rsquo;s a training </strong></li><li> <strong>  No more than three meetings to make any decision </strong> <br/>  </li><p> There were many big ideas for Barbie, too many, Richard Dickson, said in 2014 as chief brand manager. Imagine the surprise when Mattel later revealed the comeback plan for Barbie: 23 new looks with different skin tones and hair colors. That way, Barbie can become relevant for an increasingly diverse population. And to top it all off, Barbie can now talk.</p><p> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1WS78OTEMVo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-15-at-8.13.55-AM.png\" width=\"848\"/> </a> <br/> click to view</p><p> As a talking doll has been a top request by girls, Mattel had explored the idea of a talking Barbie for years.

{"original_id":4252,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"When Independence Isn't All it's Cracked Up to Be, RIAs Have Another Option to Consider","link":"when-independence-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-rias-have-another-option-to-consider","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Many agree that 2016 will be the year where M&amp;A deals saturate the headlines.</h3><p> <br/> With increased compliance looming, and the cost of doing business rising, any RIA that has been leery about steering their ship in less-than-friendly waters through the coming year may be looking for alternate routes.</p><p> There certainly is no shortage of buyers for high quality fee-only or hybrid RIA firms. Typically, those buyers are investors in the space (like Focus Financial Partners, Affiliated Managers Group [AMG] or United Capital Partners); larger RIAs looking to gain scale and increase capacity, bench strength and overall enterprise value; or private equity firms that want in on the action in the wealth management world.</p><p> There is, however, one category of acquirer that is often overlooked, but definitely gaining traction: large brokerage firms and banks. They have become a viable alternative for RIAs who are looking to take some chips off the table and get back into the fold of a larger organization with all of the advantages of scale and support.</p><p> <strong>  Consider First Republic Bank&rsquo;s acquisition of super successful RIAs Constellation Wealth Management this past July, and Luminous Capital several years prior.  </strong> On Wall Street magazine reported in May 2015 that 24 independents, managing an aggregate $2B in assets in the previous 12 months, went back to being employees. And, these were just some of a growing number of independents and brokerage acquirers that will see value on both sides of the table.</p><h3> <strong>  So, what&rsquo;s in it for the RIA Seller? </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Name brand:  </strong> While standalone RIAs have the benefit of open architecture access to robust capabilities, what they almost all lack is the cache of a name brand. When serving the high net worth set, it&rsquo;s hard to compete with iconic names like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, for example.</p><p> <strong>  Best in class access: </strong>  RIAs presumably have the ability to access any and all products and services, but unless those RIAs have the bandwidth to fully vet every option and the scale to meet stated minimums, oftentimes they are left lacking. Big firms offer easy access to an uber-robust solution set relative to investment management, lending, trust, insurance, private banking and the like.</p><p> <strong>  Offload the minutia: </strong>  Most principals of RIA firms complain about having to manage the aspects of their businesses that just don&rsquo;t spark them&mdash;like operations, admin, human resources, compliance, real estate, etc. And, with greater regulatory pressure bearing down, the ability to leverage a turnkey offering and focus exclusively on client-centered activities can be utopia to some business owners.</p><p> <strong>  Succession plan: </strong>  With large numbers of advisors working for these banks and brokerages, the likelihood of finding your next-gen successor is very high. Plus, almost every large firm has a &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; program in place, which allows advisors to monetize in a meaningful way when it comes time to retire.</p><p> <strong>  Ability to move once and monetize twice: </strong>  Brokerage firms and banks are offering enormous transition packages, and the most aggressive ones are being offered to RIAs looking to join them as employees. These deals can exceed 3X revenue (structured as a 9-year forgivable loan) and also offer the &ldquo;business owner turned employee advisor&rdquo; the ability to take advantage of the firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; program when appropriate. This could easily net the advisor 5-6X revenue at the end of the day.</p><h3> <strong>  Why do brokerages and banks want to acquire RIAs? </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Shortage of talent:  </strong> With consolidation in the financial services industry &ndash; especially in the traditional space &ndash; firms are motivated to recruit from a pool of top advisors who are driven by things other than the biggest up-front check.</p><p> <strong>  Expand entrepreneurial mindset:  </strong> RIA principals tend to have the entrepreneurial spirit that wirehouses seek in their advisor talent.</p><p> <strong>  Increase assets under management: </strong>  Most RIAs manage high quality, highly portable, fee-based businesses bound by the fiduciary standard. With the changing regulatory environment, moving advisors to a fiduciary mindset is the goal of all big firms.</p><p> <strong>  Expand product offerings: </strong>  The opportunity to introduce a new client base to a swath of banking products and services can be a bonanza for these mega firms.  (Oftentimes, clients of RIAs go elsewhere for their credit, cash management and lending needs.)</p><h3> While most principals of RIA firms prize their independence and control, some tire of dealing with the minutia that goes along with business ownership. </h3><p> <br/> After years of having to be captain of the ship, many get to a point where they are only too glad to go back to focusing solely on being a client advisor. There is destined to be a spate of M&amp;A activity this year, and any option that allows independent firm owners to get back to doing more of what they love will be a hot ticket. And, big banks and brokerages will get more swings at the ball and the opportunity to attract more of the high-quality talent they are looking for.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-15 16:24:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-15 16:24:04.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_yH4a361.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/when-independence-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-rias-have-another-option-to-consider/\", \"post_id\": \"9255\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-15 16:24:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-15 16:24:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"when-independence-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-rias-have-another-option-to-consider\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9254\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4415\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/When-Independence-Isn\\u2019t-All-it\\u2019s-Cracked-Up-to-Be-RIAs-Have-Another-Option-to-Consider.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"625\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455641100,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

Post financial crisis, dealer inventory (supply) has decreased while corporate bond issuance and AUM have increased, reflecting increasing demand. </p><h3> Trading volume also illustrates the reduction in liquidity.</h3><p> <br/> Even as the average corporate debt outstanding grew by more than 125% between 2002 and 2013, average corporate debt traded daily fell by almost half (source: SIFMA, FlexShares). FlexShares Credit-Scored US Corporate Bond Index Fund (SKOR) is backed by an index that utilizes a distinctive investment universe, liquidity screens and other constraints to help manage these liquidity challenges.

At Boston Prep, we believe in academic rigor, a structured environment and longer school days, and like many schools who put a strong emphasis on a sound college preparatory curriculum, our approach has shown strong results. 100% of our high school graduates have been accepted to 4-year colleges and some have been granted full scholarships to top schools such as Stanford and Williams.</p><p> This said, just as I sometimes think that early age athletics has gone a little too far (4th grade travel soccer games starting at 7:30am on Sunday mornings with multiple late night practices a week, etc.), has the Tiger Mom approach to academics gone too far?</p><p> If you Google \" <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=solutions%20for%20stressed%20out%20high%20school%20students\" target=\"_blank\">   Stressed Out High School Students  </a> </u> \", you might be surprised to find a long list of articles on the subject from well regarded publications such as The Atlantic and Forbes.

But do we sometimes take it too far and put too much pressure on our little ones?</p><h3> I know that I am guilty of this from time to time.</h3><p> <br/> The author of the WSJ article that I mentioned at the start of this post, Nikhil Goyal, wrote his first thoughts on this subject as a high school student. Since then, he has gone on to write for the New York Times and speak at the Clinton Global Initiative, Google, Stanford and the University of Cambridge.</p><p> Among his many thought provoking comments, Nikhil stated the following in his  <u>  first op-ed that ran in the Huffington Post </u> : </p><p> \"President Bush passed No Child Left Behind and President Obama passed Race to the Top, infatuating our schools with a culture of fill in the bubble tests and drill-and-kill teaching methods.

{"original_id":4256,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Employee Engagement is Critical to Success","link":"why-employee-engagement-is-critical-to-success","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Employee engagement has become a top priority for many financial advisory firms, and for good reason.</h3><p> <br/> Leaders of top performing firms know that an engaged, high-performing team is essential for continued growth. Highly engaged teams increase productivity, innovation, and the bottom line, while reducing costs related to employee turnover.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_engagement\" target=\"_blank\">   Wikipedia  </a> </u>  provides a straight forward definition of employee engagement, &ldquo;Employee engagement is a property of the relationship between an organization and its employees. An &ldquo;engaged employee&rdquo; is one who is fully absorbed by and enthusiastic about their work and so takes positive action to further the organization&rsquo;s reputation and interests.&rdquo;</p><p> Based on the definition, are your team members engaged? Recent surveys provide us with some alarming employee engagement statistics:</p><li> 5% of U.S. workers are engaged in their jobs ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u> )</li><li> 70% of employees who lack confidence in the abilities of senior leadership are not fully engaged ( <u>  Dale Carnegie Employee Engagement Study </u> )</li><li> 80% of employees dissatisfied with their direct manager are disengaged ( <u>  Dale Carnegie Employee Engagement Study </u> ) <br/>  </li><p> The statistics clearly tell us that addressing employee engagement problems is critical to the success of your financial advisory firm.</p><h3> Define and Address Employee Engagement with Your Team</h3><p> <br/> Employee engagement means different things to different firms. Before you can start to measure levels of employee engagement in your office you need to:</p><li> Define what employee engagement means to you</li><li> Establish a criteria measurement list</li><li> Create a system to measure engagement levels <br/>  </li><h3> Employees Want Leaders to Show They Care</h3><p> <br/> Choosing and evaluating the leadership in your firm is critical to employee retention rates and engagement levels. According to the  <u>  Dale Carnegie Institute </u> , &ldquo;A &ldquo;caring&rdquo; manager is one of the most important elements that drives employee engagement.&rdquo;</p><p> The  <u>  report goes on to say </u> , &ldquo;That is, employees want their managers to care about their personal lives, to take an interest in them as people, to care about how they feel and support their health and well-being. A manager&rsquo;s ability to build strong relationships with employees, build strong team interaction, and lead in a &ldquo;person-centered&rdquo; way creates an engaging environment in which employees can perform at the highest possible level.&rdquo;</p><h3> Boosting and Measuring Employee Engagement</h3><p> <br/> Employee engagement begins with hiring the right person. Hiring managers must provide new employees with a realistic job preview, provide on-the-job training, and offer access to additional training or education as needed. Spikes in levels of employee engagement occur when these components are put in place.</p><p> You can also boost levels of employee engagement by understanding how each team member is motivated and knowing what they value. Implement an employee engagement survey into your routine processes and incorporate a &ldquo;values-list.&rdquo; Once values are understood, you are positioned to incorporate motivational methods to increase engagement. A well-designed survey will provide you with a quantitative measure such as a score from 1 to 10 or a percentage. Avoid placing 100% of your focus on the survey outcome by developing solutions to meet employee needs both personally and professionally.</p><p> <strong>  Leading businesses in employee engagement share the following suggestions to boost engagement levels in your firm: </strong></p><p> <strong>  Gifts:  </strong> Make it more than a bouquet of flowers or a gift card. Although these are nice from time to time, their sentiment wear off. Use your creativity to find a gift relating to a specific project completed by your team or an individual. The gift along with the story will be remembered and shared for years.</p><p> <strong>  Money Still Matters:  </strong> Study after study shows when specific behaviors are tied to a significant dollar, the behaviors are more likely to occur.</p><p> <strong>  Rewards and Incentives: </strong>  Incorporate other methods such as: recognition, awards for distinguished service, an extra day off, or tickets to unique event in your community.</p><p> When your team is aware of the direct link between their level of engagement, behaviors, and productivity to rewards they value, motivation and engagement increase significantly. This creates a win-win combination as the team and the company move toward the same goals.</p><h3> In Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Managed properly employee engagement systems provide loyalty and devotion for your firm. Listen to your team, hear them, and take them seriously. Rewards after engagement is lost is too little and too late.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t assume you know your team levels of engagement without a system in place. Be pro-active by utilizing or implementing an employee engagement system.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 16:00:42.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 16:00:42.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_IbMrW8g.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-employee-engagement-is-critical-to-success/\", \"post_id\": \"9262\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 16:00:42\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 16:00:42\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-employee-engagement-is-critical-to-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9261\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4420\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Employee-Engagement-is-Critical-to-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"486\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455739200,"author_id":28,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4257,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Reasons Why Every Developing Country Need Entrepreneurs and NOT Handouts","link":"10-reasons-why-every-developing-country-need-entrepreneurs-and-not-handouts","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> According to The World Bank, 75 million people ages 16-24 are unemployed around the globe.</h3><p> <br/> That's nearly double the entire population of Central America. The lack of jobs usually indicates a shortage of entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs don't look for jobs, they create jobs. </p><p> The economic success of developing nations hinges on whether or not they encourage and reward the spirit entrepreneurship or simply wait for more handouts. Entrepreneurs can put an end to the systemic poverty that has plagued many countries for so long.</p><p> Entrepreneurs have always served as the spark plug for every economic engine worldwide. The fuel this engine runs on, is a country's natural resources or the unique location it has been blessed with. However, for lubrication, the economic engine relies on government policies and programs that support and encourage entrepreneurship.</p><h3> ​The Insurance Against Unemployment</h3><p> <br/> The best employment insurance program a country can have, is to invest into the lives of young people...encouraging, equipping and motivating them to become entrepreneurs. Unemployed person tend to have a lower self-esteem which makes it even more difficult for them to find a job.  ​When there are no jobs to be found, the only alternative is to create them.</p><p> Unless developing countries put forth a serious effort to support young entrepreneurs, out-migration and the resulting brain-drain will continue curb the growth of their economies. We must create incentives for them to stay.</p><p> When I am speaking to young people in developing countries, my message is: \"Stay home. You can be successful where you are. The grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. You can make a difference and have an impact right where you are.\"</p><h3> Knowing How To Fish Is Not Enough</h3><p> <br/> It's not enough to teach people how to fish...we must educate, motivate and inspire them to start fishing businesses that create jobs and not only feed their families but transform their communities. ​That way they have a reason to stay home and transform their own communities instead heading abroad for greener pastures.</p><p> The prosperous countries in the world are always the ones that have the most entrepreneurs and an infrastructure that encourages and motivates young entrepreneurs to take risks and launch new enterprises. </p><h3> It Takes The Right Mindset and The Right Skillset</h3><p> <br/> A society can only rid itself of a victim mentality and take on an abundance mindset to the degree to which it rewards and encourages entrepreneurial activity. The more entrepreneurs, the fewer victims. The fewer victims, the less poverty and corruption.</p><p> In recent years, economists have come to realize that entrepreneurship is a key element of economic activity. Big corporations are no longer viewed as secure source of employment creation as in the past. </p><h3> 10 Reasons Why Every Developing Country Needs Entreprenuers</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Entrepreneurs are creative. </strong>  They see a need and quickly find a way to meet it. The fact something has not yet been done is all the more motivating for an entrepreneur.</p><p> <strong>  2. Entrepreneurs are motivated. </strong> They are also energized and  <u>  <a href=\"http://knowgogrow.com/7-smart-tips-on-how-to-become-comfortable-taking-risks-as-an-entrepreneur\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   willing to take risks  </a> </u>  with their own money and with the investment of others. Their ideas trigger the sale and production of new innovative products and services.</p><p> <strong>  3. Entrepreneurs create jobs.  </strong> It is the entrepreneur who is not satisfied knowing how to fish, but rather wants to have his own fishing business in search of profit thereby satisfying unsatisfied needs and creating jobs in the process.</p><p> <strong>  4. Entrepreneurs are developers.  </strong> They are capable of bringing together the funding, raw materials, manufacturing facilities, skilled labor and land or buildings required to produce a product or service. They are also able to arrange the marketing, sales and distribution of their product or service.</p><p> <strong>  5. Entrepreneurs are positive and optimistic.  </strong> They don't have a victim mentality and believe success is possible without having go abroad to find it.  Tough times don't last, but tough entrepreneurs do!</p><p> <strong>  6. Entrepreneurs are future oriented. </strong>  They believe that success is possible and are willing to risk their own resources and reputation in the pursuit of profit. They believe that the future will always be better than the past.</p><p> <strong>  7. Entrepreneurs move fast. </strong>  They are willing to try many different strategies to achieve their goals of profits. And they're flexible, willing to change quickly when they get new information.</p><p> <strong>  8. Entrepreneurs are generous. </strong>  They freely give of their time, talent and treasure to those less fortunate or just starting out. They know that they have a duty to give back to their communities.</p><p> <strong>  9. Entrepreneurs are grateful.  </strong> They know that they have been blessed and spend more time counting their blessings than complaining about their challenges. They know that thanksgiving is key to prosperity. </p><p> <strong>  10. Entrepreneurs think outside the box. </strong>  In fact, their first inclination is to  <u>  <a href=\"http://knowgogrow.com/35-characteristics-of-an-entrepreneurial-mindset-every-entrepreneur-must-learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blow up the box  </a> </u> .  They see opportunities that others don&rsquo;t, they try new ideas that others are afraid to, and they take risks that others wouldn't dare to. This takes courage, persistence and the determination to keep going despite criticism, rejection and skepticism.</p><p> Entrepreneurs are a national resource, that should be protected, nourished, encouraged and rewarded. They create most of the wealth, jobs, and prosperity in a nation. They're the most important people in a market economy--and there are never enough of them.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;The future will be owned and operated by entrepreneurs!&rdquo;  </strong></p> <p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 16:05:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 16:05:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_7hQWi1K.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-reasons-why-every-developing-country-need-entrepreneurs-and-not-handouts/\", \"post_id\": \"9263\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 16:05:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 16:05:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-reasons-why-every-developing-country-need-entrepreneurs-and-not-handouts\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9261\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4421\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Employee-Engagement-is-Critical-to-Success.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"3517\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455732000,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}

Eh, those little social media scoundrels are amateurs when measured against real killers that cause your head to swirl at the flicker of any shiny white light.</p><p> When all is stripped away from the things you turn to when you&rsquo;re unable or unwilling to concentrate, you&rsquo;ll find there are three real reasons you can&rsquo;t stay focused.</p><p> Before we consider those, I want to explain what I mean by focus. I&rsquo;m not speaking of the four minutes you&rsquo;ll need to sit still to read this juicy post.</p><p> I&rsquo;m referring to the focus of your life, project, goals or anything else that provides you a figurative north pole. Let&rsquo;s try to build you a compass.</p><h3> The What. You Have No Vision or Blurry Vision.</h3><p> <br/> If you can&rsquo;t envision clearly what you want (to be) or what your goal looks like, you&rsquo;ll meander. It&rsquo;s a cold hard fact.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s not worry just yet how your vision becomes reality. Let&rsquo;s, uh, focus on first things first.</p><p> You might think you have eagle vision. Great! Does your &ldquo;what&rdquo; require others to help you achieve it? If so, they&rsquo;ll also need to see your vision clearly.</p><p> Any architect needs great contractors who understand their purpose, the blueprint, and timeline.</p><p> If the team has blurry vision, you&rsquo;ll get blurry results.</p><p> My vision, for example, is clear to me. It&rsquo;s a mere fifteen words. I want to be a premier source of help for people who want to improve their lives and careers.</p><p> If something enters my life that doesn&rsquo;t coincide with that vision, I quickly escort it to the door.</p><h3> The Why. Don&rsquo;t Forget Why.</h3><p> <br/> I never want the &ldquo;how&rdquo; to drive the &ldquo;what&rdquo; or &ldquo;why.&rdquo; You shouldn&rsquo;t either.</p><p> The first thing you need to figure out is what you want and why you want it. If you have a good reason, you&rsquo;ll succeed. Just make sure it&rsquo;s your reason and not someone else&rsquo;s &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</p><p> You&rsquo;ll succeed because your &ldquo;why&rdquo; will fill you with love and passion for whatever you&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> People fall out of love with activities or efforts they undertake because they stray from their &ldquo;why&rdquo; or their &ldquo;why&rdquo; changes.</p><p> The reason I want to be a premier source of help for people who want to improve their lives and careers is because I love helping people and I want to have a positive impact on their lives and the world as a whole.</p><p> My desire to positively influence more people drives me to figure out new ways to reach more people. My vision hasn&rsquo;t changed for some period of time. Neither has the reason I do it (my &ldquo;why&rdquo;). My tactics (the how), however, are continually improving.</p><h3> The How. You Don&rsquo;t Have a Map.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, congratulations! You have your vision and you&rsquo;re clear on &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</p><p> Sadly, many don&rsquo;t make it this far because they let the &ldquo;how&rdquo; drive the &ldquo;what.&rdquo; This causes people to throw in the towel before they start because they don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re going to get all the way to where they want to go.</p><p> If you undertake any journey, you don&rsquo;t need to see the entire route. You need to see the first step, then the next, and so on. That&rsquo;s the fun part, not the hard part. It&rsquo;s better to try. Produce version one. Repeat. Produce version two. Repeat.</p><p> If you undertake something more finite, such as building a house, you should complete the blueprint first to ensure all the nails, boards, bricks, and pipes fit together. You shouldn&rsquo;t start building before all the specifications are approved (at least if you intend to live in the house).</p><p> All three of these pieces are equally important to being directed and staying on track.

{"original_id":4259,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Elephant in the Room: Fees and Gen X/Y","link":"the-elephant-in-the-room-fees-and-gen-x-y","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;m sorry I missed John and Raef&rsquo;s Fees at a Crossroads webinar &ndash; my invite must have gotten lost in the mail (not that I&rsquo;m bitter about it). <strong>  But if I had been there, I would have used my 26 years of millennial wisdom to answer some of your great fee questions related to Gen X/Y. </strong> But because SOMEONE forgot about me, I&rsquo;ll just have to do it here. (Alright, enough about me; I&rsquo;m starting to reinforce the narcissistic millennial stereotype.)</p><p> <strong>  In all seriousness, even though millennials get a bad rap, they are doing something really astounding to this industry &ndash; they&rsquo;re forcing change. </strong> That&rsquo;s because advisors serving these younger clients are having to come up with different service and fee models to meet their needs. What you&rsquo;ll notice in between a lot of the Raef and John banter is that those advisors targeting Gen X/Y are at the forefront of the fee movement. They&rsquo;re the early adopters. Even if you&rsquo;re not ready to take the leap to move to these new and different fee structures, I do challenge you to observe and learn from these guys.</p><h3> Alright, onto my millennial wisdom&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Q1: The X/Y Planning fee model ($1k upfront + $150/mo + 100bps) seems awfully high, relative to a young client&rsquo;s net worth. Any thoughts on how to &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; about actually implementing that? </strong></p><p> <strong>  MP: </strong>  It&rsquo;s the age-old question &ndash; how do you quantify the value you provide to substantiate your fees? Many advisors are still trying to figure this out. You can see it by the way the industry has transformed from  <u>  commissions, to AUM, to planning, to retainer-based fee models </u> . The argument we&rsquo;re making is that you should charge where you believe you truly add value.</p><p> XYPlanning advisors, they feel they add value from both a planning and asset management standpoint:</p><li> <strong>  $1,000 upfront fee </strong>  &ndash; for the hours of planning that goes into analyzing a client to develop a plan</li><li> <strong>  $150 per month retainer fee </strong>  &ndash; for ongoing guidance to implement and stick to the plan</li><li> <strong>  100 bps AUM based fee </strong>  &ndash; for investment expertise and guidance during times of volatility <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s address the elephant in the room. </strong> Charging clients additional fees on top of the 100 bps seems controversial, especially when dealing with small clients with less wealth. However, consider the challenges in trying to remain profitable when serving this demographic. They present a ton of planning needs and not a lot of opportunity for asset management. They&rsquo;re faced with financial hardships (like student loans), while simultaneously experiencing major financial life events (marriage, kids, home-buying). Because of this and their age, they haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to develop investable assets.</p><p> So advisors are forced to roll up their sleeves and be very hands-on, something that&rsquo;s rewarding but also time-consuming. If you think of the more typical clientele (a boomer or pre-retiree), of course advisors are heavily involved in retirement planning &ndash; but a huge component of that is asset management.</p><h3> So here&rsquo;s my take on why this works: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  $1,000 upfront fee </strong>  &ndash; helpful when dealing with younger clients who have a lot of planning needs, but who are still skeptical of financial advisors. They might decide to take that initial plan &amp; implement it with limited or no help from you, which would leave you with the sunk planning costs.</li><li> <strong>  $150 per month retainer fee </strong>  &ndash; necessary when this type of client goes through significant life events and changes that will greatly alter the course of their financial plan. You should be paid for your consulting on key decisions and changes to their plan.</li><li> <strong>  100 bps AUM based fee </strong>  &ndash; even IF the client does have assets to manage, the size of that asset base will be very small, so that 100 bps charge will also be very small. For all the hands-on planning you&rsquo;re doing, this fee on its own would certainly not cover the costs of serving this client. <br/>  </li><p> Although I do recommend this general structure when working with younger clientele, these numbers are just examples. If your firm outsources your asset management and doesn&rsquo;t feel that&rsquo;s where you add value, then perhaps you charge less than 100 bps. We&rsquo;ve seen some advisors use outsourced or robo-advisor solutions with clients and only charge 50&ndash;75 bps for ongoing guidance.</p><p> <strong>  Q2: I respectfully suggest people making 50k per year will not pay $150 per month for advice. </strong></p><p> <strong>  MP:  </strong> It wasn&rsquo;t really a question, but I loved this comment and wanted to take the opportunity to address it for everyone thinking the same thing. In short, I agree to a certain extent. While I do think a younger prospect making $50,000 a year would pay for advice, you may find it difficult getting them to commit to $150 per month ($1,800 per year) for planning fees without first demonstrating real value. To do that, I highly recommend two things:</p><h3> 1. Freemiums &ndash; free advice or resources that are easy to access. <br/>  </h3><p> These require some time to put together but they&rsquo;re leverageable over the long term. For example:</p><li> <strong>  Blog posts with guidance on specific, relevant issues </strong>  &ndash; things like what to do after having a baby (establish a will, set-up a 529 plan, etc.)</li><li> <strong>  Downloadable template or guide </strong>  &ndash; Maybe a budgeting worksheet</li><li> <strong>  Free e-book with easy-to-follow advice just for your niche </strong>  &ndash; for example this could be a book for young doctors on how to dig yourself out of debt to get your finances back on track <br/>  </li><h3> 2. &ldquo;Non-committal planning&rdquo; &ndash; unbundled or partial planning services. <br/>  </h3><p> Some great examples of ways to charge for planning in a way that feels less intimidating to the prospect:</p><li> <strong>  One-time consultation </strong>  &ndash; Like a  <u>  <a href=\"http://genyplanning.com/financial-planning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   quick start session  </a> </u> , where prospects get a 90-minute web-conference session to get the answers to their top financial questions</li><li> <strong>  One-time event </strong>  &ndash; Like a  <u>  brunch-&amp;-budget </u> , where prospects register and come to the event with questions, and leave with tactical to-dos <br/>  </li><p> Even after implementing these types of recommendations, you may still find yourself playing the long game, waiting until the moment the prospects realize they can no longer manage their finances on their own. However, at least the next time they&rsquo;re ready to seek out professional advice, they&rsquo;ll think of you. Why? Because the services above demonstrate that you&rsquo;re a valuable, trusted resource.</p><h3> About those HENRYs</h3><p> <br/> The subset of the Gen X/Y demographic that Raef chose to focus on in his  <u>  Fees at a Crossroad </u>  webinar was the HENRYs (High Earning, Not Rich Yet) &ndash; A term I first used in an earlier  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/advisor-marketing-2/why-a-niche-approach-to-millennial-matters/?cmpid=ADV-BL-FEES16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog post  </a> </u>  that Raef stole (again, not that I&rsquo;m bitter). This group is a little different than the $50,000 wage earner from Question 2 above. HENRYs are career-driven millennials who earn over $100,000 per year. They still don&rsquo;t have a lot of investable assets (other than their 401(k) or IRA), but they are on the pathway to looking a lot like your current pre-retiree/boomer clients. So you might look at this group to find a niche that&rsquo;s worth going after. Their discretionary income combined with the go-getter mentality might make them more receptive to the idea that financial advice is worth paying for, especially if you use those tactics I suggested above.</p><h3> Just the tip of the Iceberg</h3><p> <br/> We only scratched the surface here, but remember that we&rsquo;re still at the beginning of this fee movement. We&rsquo;ll be sure to share more insights as we uncover them, especially when it comes to early adopters!</p><p> XY Planning is not affiliated with SEI or its affiliates.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 16:18:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 16:18:21.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_3o7SxkR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-elephant-in-the-room-fees-and-gen-x-y/\", \"post_id\": \"9267\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 16:18:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 16:18:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-elephant-in-the-room-fees-and-gen-x-y\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9266\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4423\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Elephant-in-the-Room-Fees-and-Gen-XY.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"859\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455731100,"author_id":354,"chart_url":""}

Despite the power outages, snow-blocked streets, closed businesses, folks were cooperative and friendly.  They shoveled people out, helped to move stuck cars, and brought chicken soup to the news reporters.</p><h3> Why were people so calm and helpful?</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m thinking that it was because we knew the weather patterns couldn&rsquo;t be changed. Thus, we relaxed, knowing we would be okay, and that we were in this together. It&rsquo;s that notion of being &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; that we are &ldquo;in this together,&rdquo; is a notion I&rsquo;d like to explore here.</p><p> Being a business owner, one feels that &ldquo;stress, panic, and hard to reach goals and expectations&rdquo; are the norm.  It has to come with the job, we think.  I argue that we should consider doing our best and not get overly obsessed over the consequences.  I like the illustration of riding a horse.  Holding the reins too tightly gives the horse the idea that the rider is nervous, inexperienced, and that signals the horse to be unsteady and unpredictable.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a great line from a pop tune that was popular a few years ago, but it&rsquo;s message is still very relevant: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Worry Be Happy.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;d like to advise that mindset to all the small business owners out there.  However, that still means being vigilant, just as you would be if you were riding a horse &ndash; knowing where your business is headed, and leading it with confidence.</p><h3> Here are my top ten tips to balancing leadership with the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry be happy&rdquo; mindset: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Set realistic and achievable goals, and adapt when missed, met or exceeded. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Understand when setbacks occur, and learn from them. </strong> Remember, even Steve Jobs got fired.</li><li> <strong>  Success takes time and experience. </strong> Give yourself time. In his bestseller, &ldquo;Outliers,&rdquo; Malcolm Gladwell sites the Beatles as mastering the music business, but not after playing over 10,000 hours in small European clubs.</li><li> <strong>  Ask yourself how relevant your product is to your customers&rsquo; needs and interests. </strong> Don&rsquo;t confuse your pitch with superfluous information.  Keep it simple since the only thing your audience cares about is whether or not their needs are met.</li><li> <strong>  Anticipate technical Issues. </strong> In your next power point presentation, be prepared to have something not work, and have a plan B.  For instance, if your power point slides don&rsquo;t slide, have paper copies to hand out. You will be even more relaxed at the event, and your audience will be impressed with your calm response to what would have been an embarrassing moment.</li><li> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t sabotage yourself.  </strong> Poor etiquette, boring sales presentations, not knowing your audience, or making improper political comments can destroy your best efforts. Balance the need to do things right but don&rsquo;t get carried away with trying to make things perfect.</li><li> <strong>  Keep plugging your business. </strong> Once you&rsquo;ve created a loyal customer, you can still lose them. Continue to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; by reminding them about their confidence in the product, your own business experience, the product&rsquo;s guarantee, and your customer service.</li><li> <strong>  Create a positive culture that supports those around you. </strong> Praise others, express your thanks, reward employees, and keep your employees and customers informed about company goals.  It goes a long way to building a winning and creative environment, and reduces employee turn-over.</li><li> <strong>  When a problem arises, encourage open communication and realistic solutions. </strong>   The line from the great movie about the Apollo 13 flight mission comes to mind.  When NASA realizes they have a problem, they shift into the &ldquo;work the problem&rdquo; mode rather than panic and throw blame.  Share concerns with everyone, problem solve, and from that a loyal bond is formed and a solution just may come from an unexpected source.</li><li> <strong>  Develop your business one step at a time.  </strong> Holding the reins of your business with a relaxed grip allows you to move and shift as the terrain demands. <br/>  </li><p> In summary, we need to give ourselves a break, relax our grip on our business, and see problems more as challenges to work through with our colleagues.  If you are a sole proprietor, join a networking group to share business concerns, and get ideas from more experienced owners.  Just like the nor&rsquo;easter that hit recently, we are all in this together. Focus on the positive, and oh, one more thing, if you&rsquo;re around horses, watch where you step.</p> ","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 16:30:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 16:30:27.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_EpQxAfv.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-dont-worry-be-happy-can-help-your-business/\", \"post_id\": \"9269\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 16:30:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 16:30:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-dont-worry-be-happy-can-help-your-business\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9268\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4424\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-\\u201cDon\\u2019t-Worry-Be-Happy\\u201d-Can-Help-Your-Business.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"639\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455724800,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

The most common answers:<li> <strong>  A veterinarian </strong></li><li> <strong>  A pilot </strong></li><li> <strong>  A doctor </strong></li><li> <strong>  A teacher </strong></li><li> <strong>  President of the United States </strong></li>Sure, we tell kiddos&mdash;you can be anything you want to be&mdash;even President of the USA. But can they really?<h3> <strong>  What does it take to be a US President? </strong></h3>Do you have to be rich? Charismatic? Smart? Male? A good public speaker? In the midst of an election year, I thought it would be interesting to do a small review on US Presidential personalities.<h3> Celebrity in Chief</h3>John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s father ran a Hollywood movie studio. Kennedy grew up hob knobbing with stars in his parent&rsquo;s home screening room and hanging around sets at the studio. In his 20s, he began to study the stars. He wanted to know what it took to get famous. Why did some actors stand out and become famous while others were merely forgotten and left behind by the silver screen? Kennedy asked himself the question:Are you meant to play the starring role or the supporting role?Slowly Kennedy began to cultivate his own charisma and model it after starring actors. According to Presidential Expert, Alan Schroeder, &ldquo;Kennedy developed his charisma. He worked at it.&rdquo; In his book <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081334137X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=081334137X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rrulecom-20&amp;linkId=YFM2UHJJTTQJGK57\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Celebrity in Chief </a></u>, Alan Schroeder looks at the qualities that make up a President. Schroeder was kind enough to let me interview him about presidential personality research. Here&rsquo;s what he shared:<h3> <strong>  What It Takes to Be President: </strong></h3>What are the characteristics every President should have? These days, Presidents have to deal with the media as much as they have to deal with foreign policy. They have to be a talented celebrity as much as they are an intelligent leader. Every President also needs to be the following:<h3> 1. Narcissist</h3>A President should never eat humble pie for breakfast. A healthy dose of ego every morning would do a wannabe President good. And I don&rsquo;t mean ego negatively. Ego is different than arrogance. No matter how smart you are, how many good ideas you have or how many people you help, as President someone will always be upset with you. Presidents are the constant target of criticism, and they are constantly beat up by the press, enemies&mdash;and even allies. Ego is the only way to survive it.&ldquo;Being rejected is a President&rsquo;s full time job&hellip; in addition to running the country&rdquo; -SchroederSure, you get support, but you also have to own the ego to put up with the unavoidable hate that comes with power.<h3> 2. Pioneer</h3>For Presidents, the campaign trail might as well be the Oregon Trail. Those who begin the adventure might not make it to the finish line. They might die or lose a limb on the way. They will sacrifice everything for the journey. And at the end, it&rsquo;s still the frontier. The finish is just the start. Campaigning is physically grueling work. Just because candidates are in suits and ties, don&rsquo;t forget that they are athletes. They make due on little to no sleep, have back-to-back events, speak to thousands daily and travel up and down the country every few weeks. Pioneers have to be willing to sacrifice time off, family time and vacations for their greater goals.<h3> 3. (Extrovert)</h3>This was the personality trait I had the hardest time with. I asked Schroeder directly: <strong> Do you think an introvert could be President?</strong><strong> His answer:</strong>&ldquo;Anything is possible, but likely? My gut tells me no.&rdquo; Schroeder argued that the last truly introverted President was Nixon. Much of being a successful President relies on your interactions with people. Not just public speaking, but behind doors schmoozing, political gaming and interfacing with other world leaders. Not to mention the need to rally an internal team, manage a cabinet and fundraise. As Schroeder says, &ldquo;Introverts are usually weeded out because they wouldn&rsquo;t want to be President to start with.&rdquo; I think the answer is a bit more complicated. I think anyone can learn to optimize their personality to fit their goals.This idea is not something I made up; it&rsquo;s called:<strong> Free Trait Theory:</strong> Our ability to change our personality to reach our goalsIf a 6&rsquo;5\" man wanted to become a horse jockey (who are typically short), he would have to learn to ride fast as a tall person. He wouldn&rsquo;t cut off his feet, he would simply learn to ride another way. I believe any introvert can learn how to schmooze, chat and negotiate if their heart&rsquo;s desire is to be President. Just like any extrovert can learn to be a listener if they want to learn from a wise teacher. Sure, extroverts have built in qualities that will help them on the campaign trail, but I don&rsquo;t believe they are essential.What matters more than extroversion is &lsquo;celebrity.&rsquo; Let me explain&hellip;.<h3> 4. Celebrity</h3><strong> In our modern era, Presidents have to love the limelight, not just tolerate it.</strong>Think back to the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney. Obama nearly blew his campaign during that debate. Why? Romney felt comfortable. He relished the stage. He didn&rsquo;t seem rushed or hurried, and you can tell he felt it was a privilege to be there. See my full analysis of the debate <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2012/10/non-verbal-behavior-of-the-presidential-debates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> here</a>.Obama, on the other hand, seemed irritated and annoyed at having to be there. He came across as dismissive and superior as if he believed the debate was not worth his time and energy. It might not have been&mdash;he had other things to take care of like running a country. In that moment, he didn&rsquo;t need to show smarts, he needed to show celebrity. Schroeder describes this is a Showbiz Presidency. Presidents of today have to be willing to go on talk shows, do reality bits and Funny or Die segments. They have to love the limelight.&ldquo;Presidents have to be comfortable in their own skin no matter what stage they are on. Any discomfort makes the audience uncomfortable.&rdquo; &ndash;SchroederVoters can confuse a candidate&rsquo;s lack of desire for fame as a lack of desire to run. Presidents either have to love every second of it or they have to be able to fake it&hellip;<h3> 5. Performer</h3>Reagan was once asked by a journalist about the transition from actor to President. He famously responded,<strong> &ldquo;How can a President not be an actor?&rdquo;</strong>No matter how much you like the spotlight, Presidents still have to be able to perform on the spot. They need to be amazing at memorizing lines and full speeches. They have to be able to deliver impromptu anecdotes, they have to pretend to like people they despise and they have to be able to improvise through any situation. Acting is part of the job.&ldquo;The politicians who fail begin to resent the fact that performing is expected of them. The only way they can succeed is if they embrace it. Acting is not just a side effect of the job, it is the job.&rdquo; -SchroederRead a great essay on how all politicians are actors by the famous Arthur Miller: <u> <a href=\"https://neh.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/handle/11215/3773/LIB40_002-public.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  On Politics and the Art of Acting </a></u>.<li> <strong>  Nonverbal Power: </strong>  Like actors, Presidents are also nonverbally directed and scripted. In fact, bad actor candidates are often so buttoned up that they seem fake. Think about McCain&rsquo;s fake smile or the classic picture of President Nixon shaking hands while looking at his watch. The reason why we love watching a President&rsquo;s body language is because it is the only place where we might get something real. Anyone can read a teleprompter, but it is very hard to control our microexpressions and body gestures. Body language is often the only thing voters have to see truth leaks.</li><h3> 6. Husband (or wife)</h3>Running for President is a couple&rsquo;s race. President&rsquo;s give up every ounce of control over their privacy and home life. Their spouse needs to not only be on board, but prepping the living room for cameras. Spouses provide crucial support on the rise to Presidency:<li> <strong>  Social Proof:  </strong> At the most basic level, a spouse shows the public that the candidate is loved. They are literally the #1 fan. When the candidate makes a joke on stage, the cameras always first pan to the spouse in the audience laughing. When the candidate makes an important speech, their husband or wife is right behind them smiling proudly. The spouse demonstrates how the public should feel about their significant other.</li><li> <strong>  Refuel: </strong>  On the trail, a spouse becomes the home base. She or he is the rock where the candidate lays their head. They are the honest sounding board and the source of real feedback for the candidate to recharge.</li><li> <strong>  Teammate: </strong> One person can win a lot of votes, but two can win triple. You know how it&rsquo;s really hard to compliment yourself, but it&rsquo;s easy to brag about someone you love? This is even more important for Presidents. Their spouses can fundraise, brag and show-off more than the President ever could.</li>Schroeder shared one of the best stories about spouses. According to Schroeder, Bob Dole was a very serious speaker and had a hard time remembering to smile. During debates and presentations, his team placed his wife Elizabeth Dole right in his line of sight. She would sit their the entire time with a large smile plastered on her face so that when he saw her he would remember to smile.<h3> 7. Genius</h3>Yes, I put intelligence last. Why? Because it is the final ingredient that makes all of the others work. We have seen candidates who were incredibly charismatic and appealing on camera, but voters sniffed out the lack of intelligence. They couldn&rsquo;t last. This is the anchor puzzle piece. If you are missing this trait, the entire campaign falls apart. I don&rsquo;t believe intelligence has to be a high IQ necessarily, but it does mean being a quick learner and a strategic thinker. It means being able to learn lots of information rapidly, synthesizing it and finding the best possible answer.What do you think it takes to be a President? <u> <a href=\"http://discuss.scienceofpeople.com/t/how-to-become-president-of-the-united-states/2158\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  I would love to know who you think is the most charismatic president in our forums.

{"original_id":4264,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Grow an RIA Firm by Utilizing Formal Alliances and Solicitors","link":"how-to-grow-an-ria-firm-by-utilizing-formal-alliances-and-solicitors","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a></p><p> One effective and relative easy way to grow a business or obtain new clients is to receive introductions from another party. The individual making the referral typically already has the trust of the person they are introducing; therefore, their opinion is viewed with significance. The referrer has faith that the business they are introducing will indeed solve the individual's needs. If a financial adviser wants to develop a business alliance, prior to asking for leads, the adviser must establish credibility by providing excellent service in their direct dealings with the referral source. In order to foster that reliability, it is critical to go above and beyond whenever dealing with a possible sphere of influence.</p><h3> Formal vs. Informal Referral Relationships</h3><p> <br/> In any business, an informal relationship can exist between two parties exchanging referrals without a particular formal arrangement or without payment of a fee. It is a relationship in which two parties establish mutual trust and whereby each feels comfortable introducing the other to their respective clients. </p><p> Another avenue is to formulate a formal business partnership defined by a form of payment for referrals based on a contract between two parties. In the registered investment adviser (RIA) industry, this is commonly done through the creation of a solicitor arrangement. A solicitor is generally any individual or entity soliciting, referring, offering or negotiating the sale of investment advisory services on behalf of a third party financial adviser for monetary compensation. </p><p> The implementation and use of solicitors can be a very successful channel for an adviser looking to grow their business. A common source of introductions to high quality individuals and high net worth prospects is through the development of alliances with other professionals such as accountants or attorneys. Such alliances with the proper accountants and attorneys can be an efficient method to obtain new clients with complex financial situations that typically already have established tax and estate planning relationships.</p><p> An informal exchange of client referrals among attorneys, accountants, and financial advisers is a common practice. However, since each practitioner offers unique expertise needed by clients, it may be more beneficial to develop a formal business partnership in order to construct a team that brings together the group's extensive capabilities to help a shared client on various matters. By implementing a team structure, additional services can be provided to clients and each business can offer a more seamless holistic service offering increasing their overall value to clients. </p><h3> RIA Compliance and Regulatory Considerations When Establishing Solicitor Relationships</h3><p> <br/> If a financial adviser wants to implement a formal arrangement with an attorney or accountant or any other third party, there are certain rules and laws to abide by. Under  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/275.206(4)-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SEC Rule 206(4)-3  </a> </u> , the terms of the fee to be paid and solicitor activity being conducted must be documented via a written agreement. Some additional requirements include that the solicitor provide a copy of the RIA firm's disclosure brochure and separate solicitor disclosure brochure. In addition, the investment advisory firm must obtain written confirmation that the prospective client received the required documents prior to establishing a client relationship. It's important to note that the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-firms-paying-solicitors-for-referrals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   improper use of solicitors is a common defiency discovered during RIA regulatory audits  </a> </u> .</p><p> Solicitor licensing requirements vary from state to state. Certain jurisdictions deem anyone &ldquo;who solicits, offers, or negotiates for the sale of or sells investment advisory services&rdquo; within the definition of an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/how-a-prospective-investment-adviser-rep-can-schedule-a-series-65-exam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   investment adviser representative (IAR)  </a> </u> . In such instances, an individual IAR must meet the licensing requirements and also be registered with an RIA firm in order to conduct business. The IAR qualifying examination is the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/nasaa-announces-updates-to-the-series-63-65-and-66-examinations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Uniform Investment Adviser Law examination (Series 65)  </a> </u> ; however, the combination of the Series 66 and Series 7 licenses held within the last 24 months or holding a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/series-65-exam-requirement-waiver-the-cfa-cfp-chfc-cic-or-pfs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   qualified professional designation  </a> </u>  may allow an individual to be exempt from needing to take the Series 65 exam.</p><h3> Creation and Registration of \"Solicitor Only\" RIA Firms</h3><p> <br/> Individuals that will solicit on behalf of an RIA firm often are required to not only qualify as an individual IAR, but also establish his or her own investment advisory firm. The business focus and activity of these types of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-firms-acting-as-a-solicitor-firm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"solicitor only\" RIA firms  </a> </u>  will be exclusively focused on making referrals and facilitating introductions to financial advisers. Yet, even if an investment advisory firm is created solely to act as a solicitor for a third-party investment advisory firm, there are certain compliance requirements to which the firm must adhere. These requirements vary by state but will often include the formal establishment of a compliance program including the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-supervision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   adoption of a written policies and procedures manual  </a> </u> . Proper  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-2015-nasaa-ria-compliance-deficiencies-books-and-records\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   books and records  </a> </u>  will need to be kept as well as certain files related to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/ria-books-and-records-requirements-correspondence-vs-advertising\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   advertising and correspondence  </a> </u> .

However, as in any successful collaboration, it will take time to develop a lasting partnership. Be patient and careful to only establish formal alliances with other professionals that share common ideals and business values that align with those of your financial advisory practice. Any collaboration and business relationship should be forged on the basis of working together to better serve and help a mutual client. Strategize with potential partners as to how combined efforts will ensure that shared clients are getting the proper expertise and value from a team of &ldquo;best in breed&rdquo; providers.</p><p> Both sides of a partnership must be committed in order to make it last. It's crucial that if compensation is being paid or shared that all sides feel that it is a fair split.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they&rsquo;ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/bitcointech/readings/princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies   </a>  </u> </strong>   (308 pages, February 2016)</p><p> A free 300 page book from Princeton University.  </p><p> <strong>  Abstract: </strong>  There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Optimists claim that Bitcoin will fundamentally alter payments, economics, and even politics around the world. Pessimists claim Bitcoin is inherently broken and will suffer an inevitable and spectacular collapse. Underlying these differing views is significant confusion about what Bitcoin is and how it works. We wrote this book to help cut through the hype and get to the core of what makes Bitcoin unique. To really understand what is special about Bitcoin, we need to understand how it works at a technical level. Bitcoin truly is a new technology and we can only get so far by explaining it through simple analogies to past technologies. We&rsquo;ll assume that you have a basic understanding of computer science &mdash; how computers work, data structures and algorithms, and some programming experience. If you&rsquo;re an undergraduate or graduate student of computer science, a software developer, an entrepreneur, or a technology hobbyist, this textbook is for you. In this book we&rsquo;ll address the important questions about Bitcoin. How does Bitcoin work? What makes it different? How secure are your bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What applications can we build using Bitcoin as a platform? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? If we were designing a new cryptocurrency today, what would we change? What might the future hold?</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1200/RR1231/RAND_RR1231.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    National Security Implications of Virtual Currency   </a>  </u> </strong>  (102 pages, December 2015)</p><p> Interesting report commissioned by the US Military and Department for Homeland Security and written by Rand Corporation on the possible uses of virtual currencies to undermine national security.</p><p> <strong>  Abstract:  </strong> This report examines the feasibility for non-state actors, including terrorist and insurgent groups, to increase their political and/or economic power by deploying a virtual currency (VC) for use in regular economic transactions. A VC, such as Bitcoin, is a digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored, or traded electronically and that is neither issued by a central bank or public authority, nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency (dollars, euros, etc.), but is accepted by people as a means of payment. We addressed the following research questions from both the technological and political-economic perspectives: (1) Why would a non-state actor deploy a VC? That is, what political and/or economic utility is there to gain? How might this non-state actor go about such a deployment? What challenges would it have to overcome? (2) How might a government or organization successfully technologically disrupt a VC deployment by a non-state actor, and what degree of cyber sophistication would be required? (3) What additional capabilities become possible when the technologies underlying the development and implementation of VCs are used for purposes broader than currency? This report should be of interest to policymakers interested in technology, counterterrorism, and intelligence and law enforcement issues, as well as for VC and cybersecurity researchers.</p><p> Two Deutsche Bank Papers:</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000359046.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Blockchain &ndash; attack is probably the best form of defence   </a>  </u> </strong>  (3 pages, July 2015)</p><p> <strong>  Abstract: </strong>  Debate over blockchain technology is raging in many online and offline media at present. In principle, the technology constitutes a decentralised ledger system that can be coordinated via peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Any ownership or security issues arising in connection with the decentralised transactions conducted across the ledger system are handled by P2P mechanisms as well, i.e. also without a central node. Ownership status is established via the digital exchange of cryptographic keys (public vs private), while fraudulent transactions can largely be ruled out with the help of the cryptographic &ldquo;proof of work&rdquo; system. Using a proof of work, blockchain technology enables the rapid, inexpensive transfer of assets and financial products between individuals who neither know nor trust one another, without a compelling need for an intermediary to reduce existing information asymmetries.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   FinTech 2.0: Creating new opportunities through strategic alliance  </u> </strong>  (28 pages, February 2016)</p><p> <strong>  Abstract: </strong>  The degree to which the payments industry has changed in just a decade is off the scale. We&rsquo;ve witnessed the arrival of new currencies, technologies, business models and forms of transactions; all within an environment of global economic upheavals and increasingly comprehensive regulation. The most significant change has been the arrival of new players; non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) that bring a groundswell of innovation and are turning market models on their head. Digitalisation has come in overwhelming waves, driven by the growth of e-commerce &ndash; first in the B2C, and now the B2B space &ndash; and the proliferation of smart devices. With it has come continuous innovation to meet the demand for technologies that drive efficiency, lower transaction costs and boost convenience. Innovative and nimble new players &ndash; fintechs and digital ecosystems &ndash; have entered the payments game, creating increased competition for already-pressured banks. But without access to a client base, the expertise to navigate the regulations and licensing of the finance industry, client confidence, and robust global infrastructure, these new entrants can only go so far on their own. Collaboration between incumbents and new players will be essential to fully comprehend the effects (both positive and negative) of technological developments on the industry&rsquo;s risk profile. Disruption in payments will continue, with ongoing innovation shaping customer behaviours, business models and the structure of the industry. The time has come for one further change; a shift in mindset from one of competition to collaboration. By exploring strategic partnerships, traditional banking providers and new innovators can together create long-term success and revolutionise the payments market and wider financial sector for the benefit of all.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://santanderinnoventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Fintech-2-0-Paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    The Fintech 2.0 Paper: rebooting financial services   </a>  </u> </strong>  (20 pages, June 2015)</p><p> Not specifically just about blockchain, but the first paper to gain headlines as it was released by a bank &ndash; Santander InnoVentures &ndash; talking of billions of dollars of savings from blockchain use cases.</p><p> <strong>  Abstract: </strong>  Over the last decade, however, a new source of innovation in financial services has emerged from financial technology start-ups (&ldquo;fintechs&rdquo;) and technology companies (&ldquo;techos&rdquo;). These new firms have been quicker than banks to take advantage of advances in digital technology, developing banking products that are more user-friendly, cost less to deliver and are optimised for digital channels. This relative success is unsurprising. These new players are less burdened by the demands of regulatory compliance which banks are subject to. They are unencumbered by complex and costly to maintain legacy systems. They can focus on creating single-purpose solutions, designed to offer an improved experience within just one product or service. They are more in tune with the peer-to-peer (P2P) culture engendered by the explosion of social media. And they are smaller organisations, designed for the purpose of innovation. Capital has flowed into the fintech sector: $23.5 billion1 of venture capital investment in 2013/14. Of this investment, 27% has been in consumer lending, 23% in payments and 16% in business lending. Fintechs have two unique selling points: better use of data and frictionless customer experience. But to date these have been limited to relatively simple propositions such as e-wallets and P2P lending.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.finextra.com/finextra-downloads/surveys/documents/32e19ab4-2d9c-4862-8416-d3be94161c6d/Banking%20on%20Blockchain.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Banking on Blockchain: Charting the Progress of Distributed Ledger Technology in Financial Services   </a>  </u> </strong>  (28 pages, January 2016)</p><p> Discussion with a group of financial services experts about use cases of blockchain in capital markets, payments and trade finance.</p><p> <strong>  Abstract: </strong>  Blockchain &ndash; the shared ledger technology which allows any participant in a business network to see the system of record &ndash; will have a transformative impact on a number of industries, including financial services, in the future. Blockchain is still in its relative infancy, but a number of initiatives under way are already driving its progression to an industrial solution which will yield several important benefits in the context of the transfer of assets within business networks. Today, participants in business networks are all maintaining their own traditional ledgers to record transactions between them within their ecosystems. Despite efforts to reduce the complexity and increase the interconnectedness of these systems through investment in integration and B2B technologies, business network participants are still typically swapping files of data between them. As a result, the processes to underpin asset ownership and asset transfer in business networks are frequently inefficient, expensive and vulnerable. Blockchain holds the potential for all participants in a business network to share a system of record. This replicated, shared ledger will provide consensus, provenance, immutability and finality around the transfer of assets within business networks &ndash; reducing costs, complexity and time, underpinning shared, trusted processes, enabling trusted recordkeeping and improving discoverability.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2016/feb/BlockChain-In-Capital-Markets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Blockchain in Capital Markets: The Prize and the Journey   </a>  </u> </strong>  (24 pages, February 2016)</p><p> Expanding on the work with Santander, Oliver Wyman then took a deep dive into blockchain use cases in capital markets with Euroclear.</p><p> <strong>  Abstract:  </strong> The blockchain concept, most known for being the technology underpinning Bitcoin, has generated a huge amount of interest within capital markets. Blockchain (or distributed ledgers) offers a new approach to data management and sharing that is being proposed as a solution to many of the inefficiencies afflicting the industry. The prize on offer is a new architecture, where all capital market participants work from common datasets, in near real-time, and where supporting operations are either streamlined or made redundant. Technology experts in Fintech start-ups, incumbent market infrastructure providers and banks are working on the underlying technology and its potential uses. However, the journey from today&rsquo;s system to a new technological paradigm will take time. The obstacles to be overcome are significant, and it is far from clear what will ultimately emerge. We see three routes to the adoption of the technology: &bull; Challenger disruptions developed outside of the core capital markets ecosystem. We expect to see these in the next 18 to 24 months. &bull; Collaborative efforts to shift the existing value chain to blockchains. While such efforts are already starting, with potentially massive benefits, it is likely to take more than ten years to overhaul core parts of the system. &bull; Mandated policy where supervisors direct the industry to introduce new market infrastructure, so that costs are reduced or that operational or systemic risk is lessened. In order to work together to shape a new future, the industry needs to take a collective view on the potential of the technology. It must embrace this potential, show patience with its development and invest in various innovative solutions to bring it to bear. It is up to major established players in the market to work with innovators to develop standards, while also preserving the existing strengths of the ecosystem, and navigating the complex worlds of regulation and legal oversight.</p><p> <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpAuxPages)/196AEF663B617144C1257F550057887C/$file/Brett%20Scott.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance?   </a>  </u> </strong>  (25 pages, February 2016)</p><p> Nice paper commissioned by UNICEF and written by Brett Scott on the opporuntinty to use blockchain for social change.</p><p> <strong>  Abstract:  </strong> The decentralized digital currency Bitcoin&mdash;and its underlying &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; technology&mdash;has created much excitement in the technology community, but its potential for building truly empowering social and solidarity-based finance has yet to be tested.

{"original_id":4266,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Goals You Need When Taking Over as Manager","link":"5-goals-you-need-when-taking-over-as-manager","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> So you&rsquo;ve just landed a new managerial position at a great company. Before you begin your new gig, take a step back and ask yourself what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish in your position.</h3><p> <br/> Your answer is probably something along the lines of being a great leader who helps employees develop professionally and ultimately plays a crucial role in driving organizational growth. (If that&rsquo;s way off base, you might want to rethink your career.)</p><p> To make those things happen, you first need to make inroads with your new team. Here some best practices you can use to hone your leadership skills.</p><h3> 1. Don&rsquo;t try to reinvent the wheel</h3><p> <br/> You should be ready to roll up your sleeves on day one and start figuring out your approach to a better operation. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should plan on enacting sweeping changes right away. Your employees have grown comfortable in their roles. By and large, they know how to do their jobs and are good at them.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t make any major changes right off the bat. Doing so could seriously work against your team&rsquo;s productivity &mdash; which wouldn&rsquo;t exactly put you in the best light.</p><h3> 2. Familiarize yourself with the strengths of the individuals on your team</h3><p> <br/> Now that you have a whole new team to manage, you need to set aside time to meet with each member during your first week (assuming that&rsquo;s possible). Learn their strengths, and ask them where they believe they can improve. Find out what ideas they have for your company, and ask where they see themselves down the line.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t automatically assume you&rsquo;re inheriting the most efficiently organized team in the world either. Again, you shouldn&rsquo;t think about dissolving teams or changing reporting structures on your first day, but it&rsquo;s worth considering whether your team could be organized more effectively.</p><p> The better you know your team, the easier it is to make such decisions.  </p><h3> 3. Set clear expectations</h3><p> <br/> Your employees have worked with their previous boss for however long. They&rsquo;ve developed routines, and they know what&rsquo;s expected of them at work.</p><p> You can switch things up a bit, but be sure to communicate your plans clearly. The more descriptive you are about your ideas and expectations, the less likely you are to have to discuss them again when employees drop the ball.</p><p> Your team is on the same page when you set clear expectations. It functions considerably more smoothly.</p><h3> 4. Be available to your employees as much as you can</h3><p> <br/> For the most part, you control how your employees perceive you. If you talk a big talk about teamwork and becoming a family of sorts but keep your door closed all the time and rarely have availability to meet with your employees, chances are your team will question your commitment to the words you&rsquo;re speaking.</p><p> So keep your door open as much as you can.

{"original_id":4267,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Is Making Markets so Volatile?","link":"what-is-making-markets-so-volatile","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> What&rsquo;s Moving Markets</h3><p> <br/> There has been a plethora of digital ink spilled about the recent stock market volatility.  I believe I need to add my two cents on what is driving the markets and what you should do about it.  Disclaimer &ndash;nobodyreally knows why markets go up or down.  A 10% drop in stocks is commonly called a correction.  Were they really wrong at the higher price?  If stocks rise by 10% or more are they correcting from their lower price to their correct, higher price?</p><p> People still debate about why the stock market crashed in 1987 almost 30 years later.  Was the October of 2014 stock market crash caused by fears of ISIS or Ebola or something else?  We will never know for sure.  Markets and economies are extremely complicated and impossible to predict.  Any article that attempts to explain what is happening is merely someone&rsquo;s best guess.  Some author&rsquo;s best guesses are missing some fairly basic points.</p><p> The first is that the debt market is much bigger than the stock market.  Financial news shows tend to focus on what the stock market did each day and tend to ignore the bond market because it is usually less exciting.  Well, the second half of 2015 was anything but boring for high yield bond investors.  I was shocked to learn on December 10, 2015 that the Third Avenue Focused Credit Mutual Fund was  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-10/third-avenue-plans-to-liquidate-focused-credit-fund-after-losses\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  blocking redemptions </a>  in cash because the fund couldn&rsquo;t sell its junk debt at a fair price. I have never heard of such a thing happening in a 1940 Act mutual fund.  The chart below shows how much more interest investors are demanding for corporate bonds above the interest US Treasuries pay.  It is important to note that the spikes in yield are not just in the energy and material sectors.</p><img alt=\"hy-bond-spreads.\" src=\"https://domestiquecap.com/wp-content/uploads/HY-bond-spreads.png\"/><p> <br/> The spreads for high yield bonds are blowing out in several sectors. Source: Bloomberg, Marketfield Asset Management.</p><p> On a recent conference call Jeff Gundlach, founder of Doubleline Capital, noted that stress in the junk bond market tends to correlate with stress in the stock market.  </p><p> Below is a chart that shows the S&amp;P 500 (about 1900) in black and the inverse US HY spread in blue (about 8% yield).  You can see that high yield bond spreads have risen to 8% from about 4.5% since 2014 and the current spread looks like we are already in a recession.</p><img alt=\" DoubleLine.\" src=\"https://domestiquecap.com/wp-content/uploads/HY-bond-spreads-vs-SPX-1024x734.png\"/><p> <br/> According to DoubleLine, the stock market or the HY bond market is wrong here. Source: DoubleLine.</p><p> Since debt is not covered much on financial media, you may be surprised to learn that the corporate credit market peaked out about 18 months ago while the S&amp;P 500 only peaked out seven months ago.  We may be further into a bear market than many people think.  The January 20th intraday low was a 15% drop from the May 20th, 2015, high, but many markets have done substantially worse.  The Russell 2000 Small Company Index was recently down 26% from its 2015 high and the MSCI Emerging Market Index had dropped by 37% from its 2015 high.  A few strong growth stocks are currently preventing the S&amp;P 500 from entering a bear market (20% peak to trough drop) while many other markets have already dropped by over 20%.  You probably are aware that the S&amp;P 500 tested the 10/15/2014 low on 1/20/16.  It is amazing to see how much lower the equally weighted S&amp;P 500 stock index is today compared to its October 2014, low.</p><img alt=\"S&amp;P-500-equal-weight-index\" src=\"https://domestiquecap.com/wp-content/uploads/SPX-equal-weighted.png\"/><p> <br/> The S&amp;P 500 bounced off the 10/15/14 low on 1/20/16. The equal weighted index has broken its 2014 low.  The above chart is the Equal Weighted S&amp;P 500 divided by the cap weighted S&amp;P 500.  The chart shows how bad the smaller companies have performed since 8/15.  Source: Marketfield Asset Management.</p><p> Some pundits have said the markets are dropping because the Fed raised rates in December by .25% and plan to regularly raise rates over the course of 2016 and 2017.  I think there is more to the story than that.  Would raising the interest rate you get paid on your bank account by .25% make a meaningful difference to how much money you spend?  Of course not.  .25% is a rounding error and not a big deal.  What is a big deal is the tightening cycle we find ourselves in today.  Below is a chart of the Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s Shadow Funds Rate, which represents how effective quantitative easing was on monetary conditions once the Federal Funds rate went to zero.  You can see the shadow rate has soared from -3% to 0% in a little over a year.  While .25% is not a big deal, 3% is a huge deal.  Tightening this much this fast is a very big deal.</p><img alt=\"shadow-fed-funds-rate\" src=\"https://domestiquecap.com/wp-content/uploads/shadow-fed-funds-rate.png\"/><p> <br/> The Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s Shadow Federal Funds Rate</p><p> The last culprit causing stocks to drop is overall global tightening.  Liquidity matters a lot for asset prices and it isn&rsquo;t talked about enough because very few people understand things like current-account surpluses and the differences between M1 and M2.  During the commodity boom of the 2000s, resource-rich nations built up massive foreign-exchange reserves.  Now that commodities are getting clobbered, nations like Brazil, the Netherlands, and the Petro States of the Middle East are forced to use these reserves to support their currencies and economies.  China is also having to spend its reserves as they try to convert from a manufacturing economy to a more consumption/service based economy.  This is dramatically reducing the global liquidity and causing stress across financial markets.  When there is less money splashing around, markets tend to drop. Here is one  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-01-19/how-china-s-fx-reserves-impact-global-markets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  smart analyst&rsquo;s </a>  four minute explanation of how China&rsquo;s reserves are affecting markets.</p><h3> Are we in a Recession?</h3><p> <br/> I have read and listened to a lot of smart financial people argue as to whether or not the US is in a recession.  Let me proudly say that whether we are in or about to go into recession does not matter much for your investments.  Ben Carlson, of  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/stock-market-sell-offs-without-a-recession/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A Wealth of Common Sense </a> , recently created the graphic below that shows the double digit losses that took place without a recession.  As you can see the US stock market lost more than 25% on four occasions without the US economy being declared &ldquo;officially&rdquo; in recession.  By the time the National Bureau of Economic Research declares an official recession, the stock market will have lost most of what it is going to lose and the recession may be over by then.  The only reason you should care about a recession is the possibility you may lose your job.</p><p> <img alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-01-15 at 3.35.27 PM\" src=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-15-at-3.35.27-PM.png\"/></p><h3> What Should you do?</h3><p> <br/> IF we are in the midst of a bear, you should know that the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.omaha.com/money/marksjarvis-some-on-wall-street-warn-of-a-bear-market/article_7fc2b0c2-4a11-50ca-91a4-73064f89518a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   average bear market lasts 19 months and causes losses of 38 percent  </a> </u> .  Unfortunately, every bear market starts out like any drop or correction and you will not know until afterwards if the final drop was 15%, 22%, or 31%.  The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 15% so far and it is possible that this corrective phase ended on January 20th.  Nobody knows if that is the case and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if markets go lower because US stocks have gone up so much over the last seven years and economies and stock markets are cyclical.  They are also extremely difficult to consistently time.</p><p> I have found the chart below to be very helpful during times of market duress.  The grey bars on top show the annual calendar year returns of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 35 years.  I observe that only six of the 35 years were negative and only three years had losses of over 10%.</p><p> The blue boxes below the calendar year returns show the stock market drops in the middle of each year from peak to trough.  In 2015, the S&amp;P 500 made about 1% from 1/1 to 12/31, but from May 20th to August 24th it lost about 12%.  Over the 35 year period, the average annual return of the S&amp;P was a whopping 11.6%, but in order to capture that return investors had to watch their stocks decline by about 14% every single year!</p><img alt=\"stocks-correct-even-in-good-years\" src=\"https://domestiquecap.com/wp-content/uploads/stocks-correct-even-in-good-years-1024x624.png\"/><p> <br/> If you are going to own stocks, you should expect a 14% decline every single year! Source: Oppenheimer Funds.</p><p> This chart helps me understand that if I want the possibility of double digit returns, I have to be willing to live with significant temporary drops almost every single year. This is how the stock market has always worked.  It may seem more volatile today because we have access to so much more information, but the terrifying crashes are to be expected if you are going to have part of your portfolio invested in stocks.  Better get used to it because it not likely to change.</p><p> You should also have an investment plan that anticipates a major correction will come almost every single year.  Your plan should involve knowing yourself as an investor, it should incorporate your risk tolerance, and be something you understand and are comfortable with.  I think most investors are best served by building a long-term buy and hold portfolio that is broadly diversified across global asset classes.  Buying, holding, and rebalancing works well, but I see it fail for investors who are over-allocated to stocks.  I am 38 years old and have half of my 401(k) in safe bonds that have gone up during the stock market correction.  Some might say that is too conservative for someone with many years ahead of him, but I know my goals and who I am, and owning the safe bonds helps me stick with my plan.</p><p> No matter what this correction becomes, stick with your plan and stay disciplined. There are lots of strategies that work for building long-term wealth, but constantly chasing what has worked recently is not one of them.  You also can&rsquo;t try and time every five percent drop because the next 2008 is right around the corner.  Don&rsquo;t forget Peter Lynch&rsquo;s advice that &ldquo;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in corrections themselves.&rdquo;</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 17:39:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 17:39:20.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_x7jWTku.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-making-markets-so-volatile/\", \"post_id\": \"9279\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 17:39:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 17:39:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-making-markets-so-volatile\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9277\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4431\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-Goals-You-Need-When-Taking-Over-as-Manager.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"682\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455721200,"author_id":123,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4268,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Financial Advisors Need to Engage Millennials Now!","link":"why-financial-advisors-need-to-engage-millennials-now","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Millennials have an 8 second attention span, less than a goldfish. But when it comes to their finances, there is good news and bad news. </h3><p> <br/> The good news is - they are desperately seeking your expertise.  The bad news is &ndash; they won&rsquo;t come looking for you (there are many reasons why this is the case, but that&rsquo;s another article).  So if you&rsquo;re looking to expand your business to the next generation, 2016 is your short window to untap the 6.2M affluent millennials, with an annual household income of over $100,000.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s why Financial Advisors need to engage millennials this year&hellip; </strong></p><h3> FinTech Startups</h3><p> <br/> Betterment, Wealthfront, BillGuard, Square, etc&hellip;are all here to stay.  Investment in FinTech startups doubled from $10B in 2014 to $19.7B in 2015.  And with that, consider another trend of &lsquo;crowdfunding&rsquo;, which will surpass VC money in 2016.  As these innovators continue to get more capital to perfect their offerings, it&rsquo;s important to remember that they have been out in the market for years now, despite their &lsquo;startup&rsquo; label.  They have identified and appealed to their target market (millennials), improved their products/services based on feedback, familiarized themselves with the regulatory obligations, and more importantly, have begun to threaten the traditional financial institutions.  While the long-established banks figure out how to handle these new disruptors, whether it&rsquo;s through building their own competing technologies, acquiring, or partnering, it is essential that you do your part to differentiate yourself in a way Gen Y values.  You&rsquo;re not just facing off with other financial advisors anymore&hellip;convenient, straightforward, affordable technologies are playing your game as well.  </p><h3> The Presidential Race</h3><p> <br/> 2016 marks what I call the &ldquo;Millennial Tipping Point&rdquo; in politics, where for the first time, millennial and baby boomer voters will almost exactly equal. Gen Yers will represent 30.5% of eligible voters compared to baby boomers&rsquo; 30.7%.  So if the right number of young voters show up to the polls (and they most likely will), the probability of them forcing dialogue and influencing policies for the matters they care about are high (almost definite).  And as the generation that has accumulated the most debt, financial and economic issues are top priority.  Also, let&rsquo;s face it, their feelings about Wall Street aren&rsquo;t exactly peachy.  Shaped by the bailout, Occupy protests, and the Great Recession, the level of distrust millennials have towards the big banks is strong enough to severely disrupt the industry.  The fundamental disconnect, though, is that there is a mismatch between Gen Y&rsquo;s beliefs and Wall Street&rsquo;s culture.  If you can understand this gap, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for you to fill in the space and run your practice in a more millennial-friendly way.</p><h3> The &lsquo;Baby Boomer-Millennial&rsquo; Overlap</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re thinking millennials aren&rsquo;t your target market because they don&rsquo;t meet your &lsquo;criteria&rsquo;, then you&rsquo;ll surely miss the boat.  Although this generation may not have your desired amount in investable assets, it&rsquo;s important for you to establish and nurture the relationship before it&rsquo;s too late.  This is the part where you have to recognize their journey, expectations, and values.  Why isn&rsquo;t John buying a house&hellip;is it because he prefers to rent or he really can&rsquo;t afford it yet?  Your window to attract this generation is very short, but the opportunity is huge.  As of 2016, majority of millennials have already graduated college (with a lot of debt) and are setting short and long-term goals.  They are in the midst of making mature financial decisions &ndash; paying off college loan, buying homes, starting families, supporting aging parents, and even inheriting assets &ndash; all of which require your advise.  With that in mind, start thinking strategically about how you can leverage the relationships you already have with your baby boomer clients to get to know the next generation &ndash; their children and grandchildren.  Although the new, high-tech products and services seem to be the most appealing to Gen Y, you have an advantage if you&rsquo;re currently advising their parents.  Studies confirm that most millennials want their parents to play a large role in the financial counseling process.  So manage this &lsquo;overlap&rsquo; period while you can to depend on your existing clients to introduce you to their children.</p><p> Overall, it&rsquo;s certain that the financial industry, as we know it, will drastically change thanks to the millennials.  And in order for you to get in front of it, you have to react quickly by engaging and educating the generation.  It&rsquo;s time for you to structure your practice differently, discover how to bridge the gap between the traditional thought-process and the new technologies, digitally communicate your value in an authentic, human way, and most importantly, recognize the impact 82M people will have in shaping society.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 17:58:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 17:58:25.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_XRKBgGC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-financial-advisors-need-to-engage-millennials-now/\", \"post_id\": \"9281\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 17:58:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 17:58:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-financial-advisors-need-to-engage-millennials-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9280\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4432\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Financial-Advisors-Need-to-Engage-Millennials-Now.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"814\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455771600,"author_id":444,"chart_url":""}

The 10-year treasury, for example, broke through 2% and closed at 1.74% on Friday, February 12 th . As bond geeks, we are constantly looking for indicators of economic growth (or lack thereof) so we are grateful for Marcia&rsquo;s research and insight. By Marcia Clark, CFA On January 26, 2015, I wrote an article questioning the relationship between falling oil prices, slowing Chinese GDP, and the precipitous decline in the U.S. stock markets. I counseled readers to take a breath, that the stock market turmoil was overdone and the U.S. economy was secure.Shortly after my article, the S&amp;P 500 index rebounded from 1903.63 to 1949.24 as on January 29 th the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced 4 th quarter GDP growth at a modest 0.7%, slightly below analyst expectations of 0.8%. <img alt=\"\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1_12.png\" width=\"494\"/> Why did the stock market react so well to such modest GDP growth? Perhaps because, if you look deeper into the GDP components, the slow growth was primarily due to weak exports and low oil prices, while consumer spending and residential construction remained strong. When considered in light of positive trends in disposable income and job growth, investors seemed fairly content with the 4 th GDP results. Concern about specific sectors of the economy are well-founded; however, as low oil prices are indeed causing an increasing number of shale oil drillers to default on their debt obligations. But lenders prepare for this type of risk by diversifying their investments, and there is little evidence that distress in the oil patch will spread throughout the broader economy. <img alt=\"\" height=\"252\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3_10.png\" width=\"537\"/></p><h3> Do Stock Markets Really Predict Economic Recessions?</h3>To twist a common phrase, every silver lining has a cloud, and in the days following the GDP announcement oil prices continued their downward trend and talk of an economic slowdown began to circulate in the financial press. By February 11, the S&amp;P 500 index had plummeted to a low of 1829.08, before recovering a bit to end the week at 1864.78. Clearly, the turmoil was not over!But does a falling stock market really foretell an economic decline in the U.S.? Let&rsquo;s take another look at the evidence. The Brookings Institute published an article by George L. Perry on February 2, 2016<a href=\"/?p=4#_edn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [i]</a>reviewing the relationship between stock market declines and economic recessions. Mr. Perry concludes that significant stock market declines &ndash; say 20% or so &ndash; do indeed tend to precede economic downturns. However, more moderate declines in the stock market happen much more frequently than do recessions. And when such declines are accompanied by decent economic figures, the predictive power of the stock market is unreliable.In fact, the most recent Conference Board Leading Economic Index published January 22 shows a strong positive trend, despite the U.S. stock market being a component of the index. It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that the index fell slightly in December due to weaker growth in housing and manufacturing. Also of note, the latest Leading Indicator Index does not include January&rsquo;s stock market decline.<img alt=\"\" height=\"294\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2_13.png\" width=\"476\"/><h3> So, Where Do We Go From Here?</h3>As articulated by Fed Chairman Janet Yellen in her testimony to Congress on February 11, the U.S. economy remains on an upward trend at present, though the future is uncertain. On the positive side, employment gains, low interest rates, and falling oil prices provide consumers with more disposable income to support domestic businesses. On the negative side, slowing Chinese and commodity-based economies, combined with the strong dollar, continue to depress U.S. exports.<strong> &ldquo;As is always the case, the economic outlook is uncertain. &hellip;economic growth could also exceed our projections&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>On balance, I reiterate my earlier advice. Stay strong, hold on tight, and wait for smoother sailing ahead. Investors with a tolerance for volatility might even consider buying into the distressed oil and gas sector. Be warned, however! A risky endeavor such as this requires an abundance of fundamental analysis and healthy skepticism when forecasting future earnings. Such a venture is best left to the boldest among uswith the ability to withstand the choppy voyage ahead.<a href=\"/?p=4#_ednref\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> [i]</a>http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2016/02/02-stocks-and-the-economy-perry","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-16 18:15:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-16 18:15:24.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Jf5e4i1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-market-are-we-done-yet/\", \"post_id\": \"9285\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-16 18:15:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-16 18:15:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-market-are-we-done-yet\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9280\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4433\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Financial-Advisors-Need-to-Engage-Millennials-Now.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"518\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455702300,"author_id":463,"chart_url":""}

The art of &lsquo;storytelling&rsquo; is an effective way many RIA firms are finding success in truly differentiating themselves and communicating their unique services and benefits.</p><h3> Short Stories that are Long on Inspiration</h3><p> <br/> The general session opened with, Tom Nally, President of TD Ameritrade Institutional, introducing the Human Finance Project. This is collaborative effort between TD Ameritrade Institutional and RIAs to collect and share stories about what it really means to be a fiduciary advisor. A press release explained how, unlike a traditional marketing campaign, real advisors will play a leading role in both providing the content and serving as a distribution channel to get the word out about the benefits of working with an RIA.</p><p> If you&rsquo;d like further proof of the power of storytelling, I suggest you check out <u>  <a href=\"https://storycorps.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   StoryCorps  </a> </u> , whose founder was one of the keynote speakers at the conference.</p><h3> Reinventing the Definition of Marketing</h3><p> <br/> Distinguishing one advisor website from another can often be difficult due to the use of stock photo and generic copy describing the benefits of working with RIAs. To provide help in this area, Joe Steuter with <u>  <a href=\"http://www.peakadvisoralliance.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Peak Advisor Alliance  </a> </u> gave an excellent presentation on &lsquo;Modern Marketing to the HNW Investor&rsquo;.  The session focused on how advisors need to look beyond the surface of basic marketing materials, logos, visual identity, advertising and word of mouth and concentrate on what makes their firm memorable, such as the client experience, mission, values, and vision.</p><p> Practical steps that advisors can make with their digital marketing are found in &lsquo;Two Secrets to Building a Memorable Advisor Brand&rsquo;:</p><h3> Secret #1:  Apply the 4 elements of storytelling: <br/>  </h3><li> The Hook-set the stage.</li><li> Rising Insights-explain the challenge your audience faces and leverage emotion to appeal to them on a personal level.</li><li> A-HA!-present the solution.</li><li> Next Steps&mdash;provide a call-to-action so that your audience knows what to do next. <br/>  </li><h3> Secret #2: Reinvent your website: <br/>  </h3><li> &lsquo;Kick&rsquo; the financial lingo.</li><li> Use language that connects.</li><li> Provide fillable web forms and incorporate interactive questionnaires/surveys.</li><li> Make it easier for visitors to move forward with action. <br/>  </li><h3> Community Minded &ndash; Doing Well by Doing</h3><p> <br/> Jennifer Hammond and Tara Valentino-Maher, with TD Ameritrade&rsquo;s Public Affairs and Corporate Events Group, lead an interactive session exploring how &lsquo;doing good in your community can benefit your business&rsquo;. Audience members enthusiastically shared their experience on the topic. For example, one advisor who runs a <u>  <a href=\"///C:\\Users\\BillMcG\\Documents\\WMM\\Current\\WMM\\A%20WMM\\Advisorpedia\\Habitat%20for%20Humanity\">   Habitat for Humanity  </a> </u> program finds it&rsquo;s a great way to connect with next generation clients who volunteer each weekend to help build homes in their community.   To be effective in the endeavor, Jennifer and Tara suggest you answer the following 3 questions:</p><p> <strong>  Find your motivation </strong> &mdash;what drives your employees and clients?</p><p> <strong>  Establish focused giving </strong> &mdash;what are the needs of your community?</p><p> <strong>  Share you story </strong> &mdash;what are the channels to communicate with your clients?</p><p> <strong>  The takeaways&mdash; </strong></p><li> <strong>  Be Authentic </strong> &mdash;A good first step is to determine &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the one thing you do better than anyone else?

{"original_id":4271,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Steps to Serving Widowed Women","link":"five-steps-to-serving-widowed-women","source_link":null,"content":"<p><strong>The population is aging and the ranks of widows, currently consisting of 11.3 million women, will continue to swell. </strong> This devastating transition prompts a high percentage to switch financial advisors or seek one out for the first time. They are aware that hundreds of thousands of advisors can invest their money, but they want more. They look for a competent professional who understands their grief and the challenges of their lives, and that is where they will place their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For future success, it is therefore crucial that financial professionals educate themselves so they understand the grief process and are equipped to communicate with and support widows. Use these five easy starting points to improve your service to widowed women:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Ask good questions and really listen to her answers.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Too many people tell a grieving widow they know how she feels, or they offer advice on how she should feel. Distinguish yourself by being willing to invite her story so you find out how she actually does feel. Ask non-invasive questions like &ldquo;What do you wish people knew about what you&rsquo;re going through?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What things have people said that were helpful, and what have they said that was unintentionally hurtful to you?&rdquo; Listen well, and ask further questions based on what she tells you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Every time you talk to the widow, whether on the phone or in person, give her the next time you will call to check in.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Grieving people are often anxious about becoming a burden to others. Calling anyone to ask for assistance takes courage and the willingness to risk rejection, both of which are in short supply. It is incredibly reassuring to know that you will call her instead. When you call, begin by asking what kind of a day it is for her and listen to her experience before going on to ask what questions she has for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Act in straightforward ways that build her competence.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Widowed women are afraid others will take advantage of them. Take great care not to speak in a condescending tone or to convey the impression she is incapable, deficient, or less than a full partner in the process. Assess her level of knowledge and educate her to the depth she desires. Keep her updated with easy-to-understand bullet points and summaries of your activities together, including the basic rationale behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Consider providing non-financial resource lists.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Use input from clients, friends, and associates to build a non-financial resource-and-referral list. Then if she needs a professional service (anything from car maintenance to a plumber), she doesn&rsquo;t have to pick someone out of the yellow pages. Remind her that your list is based on input from many people and you are continually refining it, so you look forward to getting her feedback afterwards. When you follow up, thank her for helping you make it easier for others in her situation who need services in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. Be patient with her.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Grief is a lengthy and somewhat unpredictable process, especially after such a major loss. Expect ups and downs, with frequent sad periods for months. Many widows describe the second year as even harder than the first, since the reality has fully sunk in and they&rsquo;ve let go of so much, but they have not yet developed new goals or a meaningful purpose in life. Be among the few people who are willing to listen and support her over the long haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just a few of the concepts to put into practice so you can serve the ever-growing numbers of widowed women who will cross your path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/make-a-difference-on-valentines-day\">Make a Difference on Valentine&#39;s Day</a></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 15:56:46.000000","last_updated":"2024-05-29 22:38:48.651218","image_url":"2016/2/five-steps-to-serving-widowed-women.png","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":"","white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"<p>The population is aging and the ranks of widows, currently consisting of 11.3 million women, will continue to swell.</p>","placefilter":0,"rss_include":0,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-steps-to-serving-widowed-women/\", \"post_id\": \"9289\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 15:56:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 15:56:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-steps-to-serving-widowed-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9288\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4436\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Five-Steps-to-Serving-Widowed-Women_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"732\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":28606,"author_id":24,"chart_url":""}

The sales manager.</h3>My colleague Mike (Schultz) puts it this way:&ldquo;The fundamental leverage point in many sales organizations to improve sales performance is the sales manager. Their role is to coach them on winning sales, help them manage their time and day to best effect, motivate sellers, and more.&rdquo;<h3> Sales managers are there to help sellers take advantage of all of their resources</h3>Unfortunately, the effectiveness of sales management in most organisations leaves a lot to be desired. According to our latest research on <u> <a href=\"http://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/what-defines-a-top-performing-sales-organization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;The Top-Performing Sales Organisation&rdquo; </a></u>, in most organisations:<li> 29% of sellers agree that their sales management gets maximum performance from sellers</li><li> 32% agrees that their sales manager creates and sustains maximum energy from sellers</li><li> 31% believes that their sales manager has the necessary skills to manage and coach sellers</li><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-16 at 12.34.55\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQHe6cxF0FjEeg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1562198400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9Qp2kvrIFI9YEJ4TLpo0AQgwchu7dOBIhr8N23NmvxM \"/>Roughly, only around one in three sellers feel their direct (sales) possesses the skills and attributes to effectively manage them, create and sustain energy and achieve maximum performance.<h3> <strong>  One. In. Three. </strong></h3>To me, there are five things every sales manager should be doing on a daily basis to help motivate their teams, and achieve maximum performance.<h3> #1. Coach</h3>By far the most important activity for sales managers should be to directly and indirectly coach their sellers.This means building in coaching moments before and after client meetings. Organising structured coaching meetings on a regular basis. Assessing sellers individually and collectively to see where gaps exist, and how to address them.Any sales manager I&rsquo;ve ever come across who succeeds in building and maintaining high levels of performance, motivation and engagement does so in part by directly coaching individual seller&rsquo;s skill set, mindset and behaviour.<h3> #2. Teach</h3>Closely related to coaching, but not the same: every day, every sales manager should take at least some time to teach. Whether live or virtually, to large groups or small, alone or with others, it&rsquo;s sales management&rsquo;s responsibility to create an environment in which sellers are inspired to grow on a daily basis.This doesn&rsquo;t need to be time-consuming or complex. Many of our clients simply choose to reinforce core concepts, models and frameworks from our training programs on a regular basis.Teaching is not just about skills building either: in the day-to-day reality, there are many opportunities for sales managers and leaders to teach sellers valuable lessons about motivation, persistence, values and other, similar aspects that are crucial to sales performance, but difficult to convey in a theoretical context.<h3> #3. Lead</h3>Maybe we should stop talking about sales management, and instead call it sales leadership. One of the most important drivers of sales performance across the organisation is how effective sales management is at leading the entire organisation.In the &ldquo;Top-Performing Sales Organisation&rdquo; research, we found that in Elite Performers (the 7% of organisations who have a 73% win rate), 80% of sellers feel that leadership prioritizes sales force effectiveness. That&rsquo;s versus 57% in &ldquo;The Rest&rdquo; category.<img alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-02-16 at 12.35.19\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQEBaDwfBP8XoA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1562198400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=QrFKlwOJmDAXfjBuJVE3Y_CsxFPcB65NaKDKis6OaX8 \"/>To me, sales leadership is about three things. First, crafting a powerful, inspiring and aspirational vision of what a truly excellent sales organisation looks like. Second, communicating that vision with energy, drive and consistency. And third, having the chutzpah to stand up for what you believe in, claim resources and make it a priority &ndash; even if short term results may temporarily suffer.<strong> As John C. Maxwell said, A leader is the one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way</strong><h3> #4. Strategize</h3>When I was speaking with a prospect recently, he said something interesting. After we briefly discussed the importance of sales management, he said &ldquo;Ago. Most sales managers are simply weighing the pig&rdquo;.At first, I didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about. But then he explained there&rsquo;s an English expression that goes &ldquo;Weighing the pig doesn&rsquo;t make it fatter&rdquo;.Yet, unfortunately, this is where most sales management falls short. Under pressure for achieving quarterly results, most managers spend inordinate amounts of time measuring performance by looking at dashboards and CRM/BI data &ndash; and far too little time acting upon that data.That&rsquo;s not necessarily sales management&rsquo;s &ldquo;fault&rdquo; either &ndash; they&rsquo;re often expected to report continuously, provide data to other corporate functions (Finance) and have their finger on the pulse of the organisation.But as the saying goes, &ldquo;weighing the pig doesn&rsquo;t make it fatter&rdquo;. To be effective, sales managers need to tear themselves away from the weekly and quarterly dashboards, and spend time working on their longer term vision and strategy.One of my favourite questions to ask is &ldquo;Where do you see this organisation one, and five years from now ?&rdquo;. All too often, the answer I get is silence.<h3> #5. Inspire</h3>Sales is a hard profession &ndash; it&rsquo;s the only one I know where if you&rsquo;re successful, you&rsquo;ll face a constant barrage of rejection, disappointment and failure. (If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you must have a 100% win rate).No one who&rsquo;s successful goes the distance alone.Show me a successful seller, and I&rsquo;ll show you a successful sales manager behind them. That doesn&rsquo;t mean constant handholding or close management &ndash; many top sellers prefer to be left alone to &ldquo;do their thing&rdquo;.But it does mean creating the context in which top performance becomes not only possible, but likely.Every sales manager should &ndash; at least to some degree &ndash; inspire. In daily practice, they should provide an example of how to act, think and perform that inspires others to follow suit.In a recent conversation with my colleague Mike, someone asked us about &ldquo;the silver bullet&rdquo;. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the ONE thing we can do to improve sales performance ?&rdquo;Our answer was simple: there&rsquo;s not one thing. There&rsquo;s many.<strong> Improving sales performance is about tweaking a finely tuned machine, not turning a single key.</strong>But if I were a betting man, I&rsquo;d bet my chips on sales management any day of the week.

{"original_id":4273,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"3 Simple Ways to Double Your Customer Referrals","link":"3-simple-ways-to-double-your-customer-referrals","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It&rsquo;s easy to overlook your current customers as sources of new business. But you don&rsquo;t want to make that mistake.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  You need referrals. </strong>   <br/> <br/> There&rsquo;s no way around it. No matter what business you&rsquo;re in, you thrive on that one customer telling someone about your service, thereby driving them to your site, store, or conference.</p><p> The unfortunate part of this cycle is that no matter how good your business is, it&rsquo;s hard to seek out referrals without coming across as desperate, needy, or slick, like a used car salesman. We all need them, but nobody wants to talk about them.</p><p> Luckily, we learned a ton about B2B referrals recently when we interviewed Donald Kelly, founder of  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesevangelist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Sales Evangelist  </a> </u>  about customer referrals. He&rsquo;s full of wisdom on how to grow your business, get your clients to give you referrals, and do it all without sacrificing your dignity in the process.</p><p> We came away with three simple things you can do to double your customer referrals.</p><h3> 1. Ask for Referrals</h3><p> <br/> Wait, just ask? Can it really be that simple?</p><p> It can. Most clients, provided that they&rsquo;re happy with your work, are more than happy to talk about you. They just don&rsquo;t always think about it. Like you, they get busy. Deadlines come, and they focus on other things.  <br/> In this vein, there are three reasons why this seems to be the biggest hurdle for a business.</p><p> <strong>  1) They forget to ask </strong></p><p> Sometimes, it really is this simple. Deadlines come, projects get amplified, and asking for referrals becomes something you&rsquo;ll do &ldquo;when you get the time.&rdquo; Make the time. Set a reminder in your calendar. Tell yourself that you&rsquo;ll reach out and ask for three referrals a week. Go to your sales manager and tell them you want to get more referrals, and ask them to hold you to it.</p><p> <strong>  2) They&rsquo;re fearful of rejection </strong></p><p> We know this one all too well:  &ldquo;If I ask, they&rsquo;ll just say no.&rdquo;</p><p> Put this to the test. Most people who have a positive experience with a company, be it a store, a restaurant, or a service, are more than willing to talk about it. They&rsquo;ll tell their friends.</p><p> Think of the last time you received stellar service at a restaurant. What did you do? You went and told your friends. You posted something to Twitter. You told people.</p><p> Your clients will do the same.</p><p> <strong>  3) They don&rsquo;t know how to ask </strong></p><p> This one is big. It&rsquo;s awkward to email a client months later and say, &ldquo;Hey, remember me? Would you mind telling your friends and colleagues about me?&rdquo;</p><p> Think like a client. Check out their LinkedIn page. See if there are mutual connections there, and make the ask there.</p><p> Make it easy for them to help you out. If you need to, build the email for them. Send an introductory email to them, and ask if they&rsquo;ll forward it to others and CC you on the communication. You&rsquo;ve done all the work, all they have to do is click &ldquo;send.&rdquo;</p><p> Nine times out of ten, they&rsquo;ll be more than happy to oblige.</p><h3> 2. Think About Your Yield (Think Big)</h3><p> <br/> Nobody ever grew their business by thinking small.</p><p> <strong>  Nobody ever made it big by saying to themselves, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to bother people.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Referrals are a part of business. You know it. Your clients know it. So go big.</p><p> Ask your client who their top five vendors are. Explain that as you grow your business, you want to connect with more vendors.  <br/> <br/> When they point you in the right direction, don&rsquo;t immediately go for the ask. Volley up, and give the potential client a referral before you ask for one. Something like, &ldquo;Our mutual client X referred me to you, and I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself. I work with Y and think you guys might make a great fit.&rdquo;</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve made that connection, you open the door to ask for your own referral.</p><h3> 3. Capitalize on the Groups</h3><p> <br/> No matter what you&rsquo;re selling, there&rsquo;s a group for it. From cars, to software, to medical supplies, to sponges, if it exists, there&rsquo;s a group devoted to it.</p><p> Find out what groups your clients belong to, and ask for introductions to the presidents of those groups. Put yourself in front of the decision makers.</p><p> Go to events and do speaker introductions. Chances are, you can talk these people up.</p><p> Say you intro a speaker at a conference. You&rsquo;re not the speaker, you&rsquo;re not responsible for content, but all of a sudden, people recognize you and want to chat with you. What better time to promote your business?</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> We know that marketing yourself and your business can be hard. It can be a challenge to grow your business and ask for referrals without feeling desperate or sales-y.</p><p> But with the right tools, you can not only grow your client base, but do so in a way that is professional and drives more and more people to your front door.</p><p> This post is based on an interview with Donald Kelly from  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesevangelist.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Sales Evangelist  </a> </u> .

But these taxes aren&rsquo;t the only hurdle, and lowering them would be just the first step in a series of steps to lighten the burden placed on businesses.</p><p> The other hurdle is what the  <u>  <a href=\"https://cei.org/sites/default/files/10%2C000%20Commandments%202015%20-%2005-12-2015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)  </a> </u>  calls the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; tax&mdash;regulation. Complaining about income taxes is an American pastime in its own right, but regulatory costs run much higher, eating up 11 percent of the country&rsquo;s $17.4 billion GDP.</p><h3> The $2 Trillion Hidden Pathogen, with No End in Sight</h3><p> <br/> The CEI calculates that in 2014, the annual cost of federal regulation and intervention amounted to a jaw-dropping $1.8 trillion, a figure that exceeds the $1.3 trillion collected in federal income taxes that year. Nearly $400 billion had to be spent on economic regulation alone, $316 billion on tax compliance.</p><p> Because these numbers are so large, they can be hard to conceptualize. It isn&rsquo;t until you look at cost per employee that you realize just how burdensome these hidden taxes really are. In 2012, the last year such data is available, companies in every industry paid an average $9,991 per employee per year. That means if you run a business with 100 employees, you pay close to $1 million every year just to comply with federal laws and regulations. That&rsquo;s $1 million you could be putting instead toward salaries and benefits and new business growth.</p><p> This has helped fuel runaway legal and compliance costs. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that fees at some of the nation&rsquo;s largest corporate law firms have climbed to an unbelievable $1,500 per hour. That&rsquo;s 200 times the minimum wage of $7.25, and includes only salaries, not benefits or options.</p><p> And the rules keep piling up. The chart below shows the number of proposed regulations that cost more than $100 million per year. In 2000, for instance, there were 87 new regulations costing upwards of $100 million, to say nothing of those costing less.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-number-of-planned-regulations-expected-to-cost-at-least-100-million-a-year-02122016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <img alt=\"Major Regulations Soaring\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-number-of-planned-regulations-expected-to-cost-at-least-100-million-a-year-02122016.png\"/>   <br/>   click to enlarge  </a> </u></p><p> Following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, regulations in the banking sector spiked exponentially, as you can see in the Deutsche Bank chart below. The increase in regulations, not to mention legal costs associated with them, has caused fiscal drag and prevented the formation of capital.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-more-and-more-banking-sector-regulation-02122016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"More and More Banking Sector Regulation\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-more-and-more-banking-sector-regulation-02122016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> In a 2014 survey conducted by the  <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/sk/en/tlacove-spravy/assets/2014/2014-04-29_banking-banana-skins_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation  </u>  , </a>  global financial leaders cited regulatory pressure as the number one impediment to financial growth right now. We have excessive anti-money laundering laws mandating that every transaction be scrutinized and accompanied by supporting documentation. It&rsquo;s currently easier to buy marijuana in Colorado than it is to open an investment account. If government can streamline the purchase of weed, why can&rsquo;t it do the same for investing? The regulators seem to be saying there&rsquo;s more risk in investing than in smoking dope.</p><p> But this is a global phenomenon, a contagion that knows no borders. The countries that place the heaviest burden of regulation on businesses, according to the  <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/competitiveness-rankings/#indicatorId=EOSQ048\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   World Economic Forum  </u>  , </a>  include many in Europe (Serbia, Croatia, Italy) and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela). As money managers, we see fiscal drag all over the globe as a direct result of taxation through regulation, which tends to favor government work and compliance, not innovation. Private businesses end up paying the price.</p><p> The U.S. should be a leader in this area and commit itself to reducing the blockades that impede growth and innovation. A good model for such a task is Canada&rsquo;s &ldquo;One-for-One Rule,&rdquo; introduced in April 2012 during former Prime Minister Stephen Harper&rsquo;s administration. The rule requires that when a new or amended regulation is introduced, another must be removed.</p><p> However it&rsquo;s accomplished, the time has come to reverse this economy-dragging trend. We also remain encouraged by the  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/how-these-12-tpp-nations-could-forever-change-global-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  </u>  , </a>  which promises to eliminate 18,000 tariffs around the globe and unleash trade.</p><h3> Gold Fear Trade Crackles as Recessionary Worries Hit Market</h3><p> <br/> In times of economic uncertainty and market turmoil, investors have tended to reposition into so-called &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo; assets, including gold and municipal bonds. Today is no exception. With talk of a global recession rattling markets around the world, gold had its best start to the year since 1980, putting to rest last year&rsquo;s speculation that the yellow metal has lost its haven appeal.</p><p> Gold is currently up 20 percent year-to-date, compared to a loss of 10 percent for the S&amp;P 500 Index, which adds weight to the belief that the metal works well as a diversification instrument.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-Stocks-Tank-Gold-Soars-02122016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Stocks Tank, Gold Soars\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-Stocks-Tank-Gold-Soars-02122016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Fears of negative interest rates have also spurred record gold investing and retail buying, as the metal acts as a better store of value in an environment where it costs interest to have the government hold your money. Negative rates seem to be the new favorite trick of central banks, from Sweden to Switzerland to Japan, and during her Congressional testimony last Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen commented that negative rates in the U.S. &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t off the table.&rdquo; Gold shot up $50 by the end of the day.</p><p> Demand was robust in 2015, with investment up 8 percent from the previous year, according to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Gold Council  </a> </u>  (WGC). Central banks continued to add to their reserves, resulting in the second highest annual demand in the WGC&rsquo;s records. In the fourth quarter, central bank purchases, led by China and Russia, were up an impressive 25 percent over the same quarter in 2014.</p><img alt=\"Mark Cuban just bet big on gold.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-12/COMM-mark-cuban-just-bet-big-on-gold-02122016.jpg\"/><p> The smart money seems to think this gold rally isn&rsquo;t over.

{"original_id":4275,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Have You Heard of the Most Powerful Technology for Business in the 21st Century?","link":"have-you-heard-of-the-most-powerful-technology-for-business-in-the-21st-century","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There is this old technology you may have heard of that is about to make a comeback to the business world.</h3><p> <br/> It is the secret sauce to the future of life and work that only savvy business people are starting to adopt. It does not require a change management strategy or the C-suite&rsquo;s permission to take hold.</p><p> Are you ready for the revolution that brings us back to common sense? But before I share the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; with you, let&rsquo;s take a journey into the why this old technology is the best thing for business today:</p><h3> 1. We live in a world where we trust strangers. </h3><p> <br/> In the world today, most of us make decisions around where we eat, sleep and travel based on online reviews of people we don&rsquo;t know. A friend recently told me that she cancelled a reservation for a local moving company based on the online reviews she read, where people shared their horror stories of how the organization treated them versus how they marketed and positioned their brand. Her decision was informed by trusting strangers who warned her about using this company.</p><h3> 2. People may be talking about you if you like it or not. </h3><p> <br/> I remember when social media was just rearing its head and organizations were forced online because people were having conversations about them, whether they were online or not. Some companies were forced into the conversations when bad press hit them and they could not respond in the old ways. Transparency started to matter and will increasingly take center stage.</p><h3> 3. We live in an open and connected world where everyone has a voice(and of course, there are benefits and drawbacks to this little fact).</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s a great time to be alive. If you have a device, connectivity and a way to power your device, you can easily express your voice. And if you have a voice, you have a choice.</p><h3> 4. Most people who are full-time employees have a voice outside of their work environment and are using it in their day-to-day life.</h3><p> <br/> Many companies are starting to realize that asking questions like &ldquo;should we allow our employees to be brand ambassadors?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what should our policies be about social media networks for our employees?&rdquo; lack common sense. The boundaries between our external and internal worlds are coming down as we start becoming whole again as individuals and organizations. While someone can comment openly about their experiences with other companies they get products and services from, the notion that their own company restricts them from being open is at best silly.If an organization attracts and retains the &ldquo;best talent,&rdquo; should they not trust them to be a voice for the company? Imagine, a world where an organization had conscious 21st century leaders who led with shared purpose and trusted their people? Would they understand the power of the network versus being stuck in the organizational structure then?</p><h3> 5. The myths about Millennials demonstrate how uncomfortable they made other generations feel about work. </h3><p> <br/> Do a search and you will find a multitude of articles complaining about the younger generation who wanted constant feedback and input into their work. Like any generation, they have two sides of how they show up in the world. But instead of listening to them, most companies shoved them into a broken system of work. They were actually key to our need to move back to using this old secret technology in the 21st century world because they wanted to connect with purpose.</p><h3> 6. We live in a human-to-human purpose and experience driven era. </h3><p> <br/> Many people of all ages are waking up and realizing we want to have an amazing adventure called life where work is part of it (LIFEworking). We have moved from the industrial era of laborers and hierarchy to the knowledge era of experts and top-down structure to the human-to-human purpose and experience era of people, connections and networks. This is the first time in history when business and society is fusing and more people are seeing the opportunity for business as a force of good. It is an opportunity to find unusual partners to go to market with shared purpose. The opportunities are on the edge and happen when people connect with each other in new meaningful ways. It is moving away from 20th century fear, competition and scarcity and recognizing we live in a world abundant with opportunities where we can connect deeply with others.In this world, we don&rsquo;t need to yell at each other to connect using old advertising models that no longer serve us. Imagine what can happen when we see people as people and no longer follow how the &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; lost weight or where they traveled? What if the only best practice we desired was how we were doing on our own path of realizing our purpose without needing to compare ourselves to others, as individuals or organizations?What if we trusted ourselves to know what our enough is and realize we have everything we need (including this old technology that can set us free?)</p><h3> 7. The cracks are starting to show. </h3><p> <br/> There is abundant data that is increasingly showing the need to re-invent so many systems that are cracking. For example, do we still believe today that an annual performance review or employee survey can get the results we are seeking? Do we not now see that many Millennials simply wanted to have ongoing feedback on how they were doing and were not willing to wait for the standard practice of collecting and tracking performance once or maybe twice a year? I don&rsquo;t know about you but I have been on many project teams coming up with plans on how to address the gaps in the employee surveys. And limited action took place.Today, we don&rsquo;t need annual surveys or feedback loops. It has to be infused in the foundation of how we work and can no longer be separated out as an activity. The organizations that are coming alive are the ones who are leading with purpose and finding new ways to connect people as a whole (and it does not matter what their status is inside or outside the walls).We can no longer practice one-way communication and tell people when they are allowed to express their voice. Sure, this will continue in organizations that lead with fear, competition, and scarcity who continue to treat their people as liabilities on the spreadsheets. But the organizations that truly play in the human-to-human era focus on shared purpose and experiences. They bring on board generalists who can connect people in meaningful ways.</p><h3> Finally, here is the secret old technology that is filled with common sense &hellip;</h3><h3> <br/> It&rsquo;s called the two-way conversation.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  This is the oldest technology known to humankind that needs to make a comeback in business and life. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Empathy and listening is a big part of it. And so is, trust. </strong></p><p> We have been so conditioned to yell at each other to get attention that it&rsquo;s time to wake up to the reality that this one ancient technology fundamentally changes our world.</p><p> Sure, advertisers will want you to listen to them and believe they have the answers for you. But only you have the answers, when you know what the question is. Too often, we get so caught up in the drama that we don&rsquo;t even remember what&rsquo;s important. We can choose to be overwhelmed by all the noise or we can figure out why we are here and what we want to create in the world.</p><p> Remember your voice and share it with others, openly. If you have a voice, you have a choice. We have been practicing our strong voice outside of the work environment &mdash; we have tools and ways to reach people at all levels and express our views. Last year, I tried to get the attention of my local utility with an issue I had and the only way I was able to connect with them was by writing an open letter to the CEO and posting it on LinkedIn. It worked. We can connect with anyone, with purpose.</p><p> Personally, I want to see people and organizations thrive and I know it is possible if we imagine a healthy and humane world. This is why I am dedicating my life with my LIFEworking partner  <u>  <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/6e66f1c46fa3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tim McDonald  </a> </u> , through writing and speaking, to helping each of us remember our voice and bring our humanity back to business and the planet.</p><p> So &hellip;</p><li> <strong>  What are you doing to tap into the two-way conversation? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Who are you connecting with? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Who do you want to co-create with? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How are you embedding new technologies like video, for example, to connect with people in conversations? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Where are your opportunities? </strong></li><p> We live in a magical time. Between now and possibilities, what are you imagining for you and your organization? How can the two-way conversation revolutionize your life?</p>  ","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 17:20:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-17 17:20:45.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_93lJkEC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/have-you-heard-of-the-most-powerful-technology-for-business-in-the-21st-century/\", \"post_id\": \"9295\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 17:20:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 17:20:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"have-you-heard-of-the-most-powerful-technology-for-business-in-the-21st-century\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9292\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4440\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3-Simple-Ways-to-Double-Your-Customer-Referrals.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"561\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455802200,"author_id":48,"chart_url":""}

It can and does happen, however. After enjoying the fruits of a relationship for many years, an existing advisor can get complacent, leaving room for an energetic, creative, and determined newcomer to capture the client's imagination.</p><p> <strong>  Here are 9 principles that can help guide you in trying to win business from a new client which already has strong, existing relationships with the competition: </strong></p><h3> 1. Look for trigger events.</h3><p> <br/> There are a number of circumstances that will make it easier to build a relationship. There could include things such as:</p><p> <strong>  A conflict. </strong> Due to a conflict with another client, your competitor may find itself unable to execute a piece of work. This can most commonly occur with investment banks and law firms, but similar situations can arise with other types of advisors.</p><p> <strong>  Executive changes. </strong> The individual who has a strong relationship with your competitor may leave or be reassigned elsewhere.</p><p> <strong>  Reorganizations. </strong>  This may cause the client to rethink how it distributes its business among outside firms.</p><p> <strong>  Economic events or shocks. </strong>  Sometimes, a profit crunch or loss of market share will trigger a company to rethink its use of advisors (e.g., clients will often change advertising agencies for these reasons).</p><p> <strong>  Turnover or retirements at the competition. </strong> If a lead partner or key relationship manager retires, for example, this may be an opportunity to press your case and invest in trying to capture some share of wallet.</p><p> <strong>  A service or quality failure on the part of your competition. </strong> One of my clients won over a new client despite that company's 10-year relationship with another advisor. They were told that the incumbent, in 10 years, had never learned anything about the client's business, and the client was tired of their complacency and of the generic advice they were getting.</p><h3> 2. Try to identify something small or non-threatening that you can work on.</h3><p> <br/> If, in order to hire you, a client has to dump an existing provider with whom they have a good relationship, your chances of success are very small.</p><p> How would you feel if someone you just met said, I want to be your friend, but you have to get rid of your best friend in order for us to build a relationship?</p><h3> 3. Focus on an area where you are clearly differentiated or have a tangible strengths vis-&agrave;-vis your competitor.</h3><p> <br/> I've seen firms make inroads because they had a strong presence in a particular market or country, or had done some unique research around an issue of importance to the client. Ask yourself, where do we have a particular strength we can leverage?</p><h3> 4. Invest to earn their trust and respect.</h3><p> <br/> The incumbent has the advantages of knowing the client better than you and having built up a repository of trust that you lack. You're probably going to have to go above and beyond in terms of making an up-front investment in understanding the client's issues and organization.</p><h3> 5. Identify executives in the client organization who are not so loyal to the other provider.</h3><p> <br/> You'll certainly be able to capture the attention and interest of these executives more easily, potentially dividing and conquering.</p><h3> 6. Emphasize innovation and new ideas.</h3><p> <br/> Clients are always looking for fresh perspectives, and they will usually not let an existing relationship get in the way of at least listening to someone else's good ideas. One of my own clients aspired to work for a major global company based in London, one that was the largest client of their direct competitor. Their ticket to entry was a bold strategy which involved leading with a controversial but well-developed and innovative viewpoint on the future of the industry. They also leveraged strategy, above, by appealing to a senior executive who was less tied to the other firm. Once inside, they all but entirely displaced the competition.</p><h3> 7. Be patient and persistent.</h3><p> <br/> Usually, it will take many visits and many conversations over a long period of time&ndash;months not weeks, certainly to find the right opening.</p><h3> 8. Stay in touch so you are there when your number comes up.</h3><p> <br/> This applies to any new business development situation, but even more so when there is a major, established competitor. You may get lucky and receive what seems like a call out of the blue because a client's advisors have an unforeseen conflict, but even such a call is likely to be the result of your systematic relationship-building efforts rather than serendipity.</p><h3> 9. Pick your shots.</h3><p> <br/> When there is a strong incumbent, breaking in can be an uphill struggle, and it's no fun to bang your head against a door. Be selective about investing your time, and focus on those few opportunities where the potential payoff (future revenue, opportunity to serve a marquis client, etc.), multiplied by the probability of success, suggest a worthwhile goal. Sometimes, until there are some major personnel changes, the client just isn't going to give you any business under any circumstances. If that's the case, move on.</p><p> Relationships do change&ndash;they aren't cast in concrete. Remember, this very week, your competitors are calling on your own best clients, trying to capture some of their business&ndash;the least you can do is return the favor.</p><h3> Don't just play defense.</h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 17:26:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-17 17:26:51.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_LtWVxBO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/winning-a-new-client-when-there-is-an-incumbent/\", \"post_id\": \"9297\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 17:26:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 17:26:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"winning-a-new-client-when-there-is-an-incumbent\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9296\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4441\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Winning-a-New-Client-When-There-Is-an-Incumbent_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"735\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455858000,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4277,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Preparation is Vital to High Performance","link":"preparation-is-vital-to-high-performance","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It appears that stress is all the rage.</h3><p> <br/> Bigger, faster, stronger: the current landscape of sports. How big, how fast, and how strong should we expect to be? It&rsquo;s a lot to handle, and I&rsquo;m not sure we are prepared. It&rsquo;s no longer just the athletes I am talking about. It&rsquo;s the coaches, athletic directors, university presidents and other sports executives who are reaching their boiling point.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not that we should be blind to the pressures of these roles, but given recent health scares, perhaps we&rsquo;d be wise to heed the warning.</p><p> Many professional football teams provide their head coaches with &ldquo;executive physicals.&rdquo; While well-intended, for many they often serve as the green light to &ldquo;hold on tight and let &rsquo;er rip.&rdquo; What about one&rsquo;s social, emotional and psychological well-being?</p><p> It&rsquo;s time to be proactive and address both the physical and psychological health of our sports leaders. We have to go beyond reminding them to slow down and take it easy. If they knew how to relax, they would. Teaching our leaders self-management skills is essential for leadership effectiveness. They simply have to take care of themselves in order to be available and effective with others.</p><p> They are pulled in so many directions that it&rsquo;s a wonder that they do as well as we do. The more success they have, the greater the distractions. Efforts to control all these variables can be overwhelming. It&rsquo;s no wonder high-achieving, goal-oriented, type A&rsquo;s are overheating at a seemingly record pace.</p><p> For many coaches, their season becomes about survival. Not so much in terms of wins and losses, but survival of one&rsquo;s self. And what if they want to go beyond just &ldquo;survival&rdquo; and getting the job done, to performing up to their potential? What can they do to stay in the game for the long run?</p><p> This requires learning some new skills &mdash; mind skills &mdash; like the ability to focus. How do they get better at sorting through all the stimuli that bombard them day to day, moment to moment? Selective attention serves them well. It helps them stay on task. The down side is they could miss some very important things. They can be so focused on the task at hand that they become limited in their situational awareness.</p><p> Bud Grant, the hall of fame football coach of the Minnesota Vikings, once told me that he disliked the use of charts and clipboards on the sidelines. He went on to tell me that while his coaches have their focus on the charts, they are not able to notice the facial expression of the opposing player grimacing with pain indicating a weakness. Those subtle cues would help him in the play-calling of the game.</p><p> Most coaches and leaders have a high bar regarding their own performance expectations. They are hard drivers and demand perfection of themselves and others. Attention to detail is usually seen as a sign of strength. It&rsquo;s also about control.</p><p> Most coaches could tell you what they will be doing at 4:10 p.m. six months from today. For many, this kind of high functioning is seen as something that demonstrates preparedness or &ldquo;quality leadership&rdquo; versus some kind of obsessive or dysfunctional behavior.</p><h3> Good leadership is about creating an environment that promotes best efforts. </h3><p> <br/> Some of the latest research in neuroscience suggests that for high performance to occur, leaders need to create an optimal learning environment. We now know that anxiety and high emotions, positive or negative, can inhibit decision-making. It&rsquo;s also not good for health.</p><p> Being too analytic and self-critical is another recipe for disaster. It can also create a cognitive mess. Instead of relying on the repetitions of practice, people begin to fear mistakes. They think too much, and suddenly something quite natural becomes unnatural. For an athlete, the result means being late on a 95 mph fastball or getting beat deep due to being a step too slow. For a coach or sports executive, it means thinking versus being, a kind of &ldquo;double-think,&rdquo; questioning of knowledge and experiences that have accumulated throughout one&rsquo;s career.</p><h3> High performance is all about preparation. Attention is about energy and information flow. Our mind helps us regulate and modify that energy flow.</h3><p> <br/> The more we practice, the more automatic the response. Our efforts become almost subconscious. Behavior resembles something like auto-pilot; it exists below one&rsquo;s awareness. The result is we actually pay less attention. The goal should be a quiet mind, a kind of effortless attention. The word &ldquo;play&rdquo; comes to mind.</p><p> Why should all this be so difficult for coaches and leaders to achieve? Can you imagine embracing these concepts on the big stage of collegiate and professional sports? Self-care, empathy, play, a quiet mind &mdash; the reality is that these are the topics that often bring fear and anxiety to those in the world of competitive sports. No one wants to shed their defenses and actually appear soft, or, worse yet, vulnerable or even human. Yet it is precisely that, our humanness, that allows for not only great leadership, but great followership as well.</p><p> It takes courage to challenge popular yet outdated norms. Perhaps we should bring to light a new form of mental toughness. Creating a culture of high performance will benefit not only the leaders of our industry but performance on the field, as well.</p><p> One last example of how we might get in our own way: the notion that more is better. In most football offices, ballparks or C-level suites, nobody wants to be the last to arrive or the first to go home. Being the first car in and last car out is often mistakenly seen as a sign of caring and dedication.

{"original_id":4279,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Embrace the Negative Review","link":"embrace-the-negative-review","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Nobody is perfect. And, no company is perfect.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not a matter of if you will ever have a customer complain. It&rsquo;s when. Something is going to fail. It may or may not be your fault or in your control, but you are going to hear about it. And there is a chance that your customer will tell more people than just you. They will shout it out to the rest of the world by airing their disappointment on Twitter, Facebook or other social channels. Or they will post their comments on Yelp, Trip Advisor or other review sites. And don&rsquo;t think that this is limited to just B2C types of businesses. There are hundreds of B2B industry review sites for customers to leave their negative reviews.</p><p> All that said, a negative review is not so bad. I&rsquo;ll give you two reasons.</p><h3> 1. First, I&rsquo;ll assume that you don&rsquo;t get that many negative reviews.</h3><p> <br/> I know this is a big assumption, but I have to assume that if you&rsquo;re taking the time to read my articles and watch my videos, you are focused on creating a positive customer experience. What that means is that you care enough about a customer that is disappointed or angry that you want to &ldquo;right the wrong.&rdquo; If a negative review is posted, the good companies respond with an apology and make the attempt to fix the problem. They come back later and thank the customer for the opportunity to resolve the issue. That publically shows that you do the right thing. It looks good and shows you care and will stand behind what you do or sell.</p><h3> 2. A less than perfect score in the review sites with a few negative comments may not be so bad.</h3><p> <br/> What I&rsquo;m saying is that an occasional, and occasional is the operative word here, negative review can actually be good. Tom Ryan, writing for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.retailwire.com/discussion/18827/the-positive-power-of-negative-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RetailWire  </a> </u> , shared some insights from a recent Northwestern University study. On the five star scale, when the star ratings are higher than three, the likelihood of a customer buying increases. But here is where it gets really interesting. That likelihood of a purchase peaks when the average star rating is, on average, between 4.2 and 4.5. The team conducting the study at Northwestern reasons that when the average is a perfect 5.0, consumers think that it is &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo; and as a result, ignore the ratings because they are assumed fake.</p><h3> Here is the bottom line.</h3><p> <br/> A negative review, like any complaint, is an opportunity to show how good you are. The difference is that  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/invite-customers-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   review  </a> </u>  sites take that opportunity public, which can be good; very good!</p><p> When people are looking at review sites, they are looking for confidence to support their desire to buy whatever you&rsquo;re selling. Peer reviews are important. Seeing that a company fixes a problem may be even more important. Embrace the negative review as the opportunity to show the world that you take care of your customers!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 17:40:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-17 17:40:15.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ci9d4o9.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/embrace-the-negative-review/\", \"post_id\": \"9302\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 17:40:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 17:40:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"embrace-the-negative-review\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9301\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4444\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Embrace-the-Negative-Review.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"470\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455804000,"author_id":439,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4280,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Two Critical Questions for an Ideal Client Experience","link":"two-critical-questions-for-an-ideal-client-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Financial advisors plan to have regular meetings with their ideal clients. I never call them review meetings, because it sounds like work, I call them progress update meetings. In your planning, do you have a strong process that creates a positive client experience? Or do you talk about the market volatility until the client leaves? How can you create a better experience for your ideal clients? Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p><p> This past weekend, my wife and I decided to check out a new community and look at new show homes. We enjoy looking at show homes, but this was possibly an exercise to look at making a big change in our lives. After spending the afternoon looking at show homes, on the drive home my wife turns to me and says, 'let&rsquo;s just plan on doing some upgrades to our existing home and see what that looks like&rdquo;.</p><p> When we got home we started to map out what we would like to do, when we wanted to do it, who we needed to hire (people who know me know that I am as handy as a bag of hammers) and how much it will cost. In the end we had clarity around what we would like to do. </p><p> The two critical questions I have for financial advisors are:</p><h3> Do you have a clearly defined and written process for your ideal client meetings?</h3><h3> <br/> Does it involve clarity around your client&rsquo;s financial goals?</h3><h3> <br/> Goals based planning</h3><p> <br/> Most financial advisors usually have one or two goals for their ideal clients. Yet, when clients do goals planning online, there is usually 8-10 goals. To create a positive client experience in your progress update meeting consider the following discussion. &ldquo;The purpose of part of the meeting today ( It is on the agenda) is to get a deeper understanding of your goals. When you look at the following list of possible goals, which one would you like to discuss further?&rdquo; or which one has changed , or which one is most important to you and why? &ldquo;Use this as an opportunity to find out why that goal is important. As Simon Sinek wrote in his great book &ldquo;Start With Why&rdquo; by Portfolio Publishing; Reprint edition (Dec 27 2011), Simon said that a why is a &ldquo;passion, cause or belief&rdquo;. If we do not understand what drives their decisions around their goals, that how can we hold them accountable for reaching them?</p><p> <strong>  The goals list </strong></p><li> <strong>  Retirement </strong> -Lifestyle -Education</li><li> <strong>  Vehicle </strong> -Major purchase -Health care</li><li> <strong>  Home </strong> -Celebrations -Gifts- donations</li><li> <strong>  Bequests </strong> -Care for someone-Business</li><li> <strong>  Memberships </strong> -Inheritance- Legacy</li><li> <strong>  Other </strong> -I am sure you could easily add to this list <br/>  </li><p> You do not see financial planning on the list because this is not a goal. The goals focus on one thing, outcome. What is the outcome that your ideal clients want? Pay less tax is not a goal, but spending the tax I saved on a trip to the Caribbean with my family is. Planning a home renovation instead of buying a new home is part of my lifestyle goals.</p><p> As <a href=\"http://www.billbachrach.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Bill Bachrach </a> says,  &ldquo;become a master at helping people define clear targets with specific dates and amounts of money wanted. Their goals are the tangible what they want built on the foundation of their values. You can develop the skill to lead an emotionally compelling and inspiring conversation about their goals. It&rsquo;s a skill, maybe even an art form. And it&rsquo;s learn-able.&rdquo;</p><h3> Steps to your clearly define your progress update process</h3><p> <br/> Besides getting together a financial summary, what steps are involved in preparing for an ideal client update meeting? I have put together a list of questions that you could put on an agenda, and eventually expand your process.</p><li> Determine your ideal clients through a segmentation exercise -Ideal client name</li><li> Determine how many meetings you will have per year -number of meetings</li><li> Determine how many touches you will have for ideal clients for the year and communicate your process -ongoing communications</li><li> Determine the names of the meetings, for example if I have two meetings a year, I would call each meeting a different name such as goals update meeting, risk management / insurance / estate meeting or tax and goals update meeting or lifestyle update meeting -names of meetings</li><li> Determine how you will document and update their financial goals and plans -planning advice</li><li> Determine how you will update and keep track of all clients goals and values -goals process</li><li> Determine how often you will call ideal clients in between meetings -ideal client touches per year</li><li> Determine an agenda for the meeting -agenda</li><li> Determine if you will collect feedback (critical) at each meeting and how-feedback</li><li> Determine how you will discuss costs or fees -fee ready and trust</li><li> Determine who will trach the meetings and how in your CRM system -CRM processes</li><li> Determine how you will discuss your ongoing improvements to your value proposition each year ( if you want to charge more you will have to deliver more each year) -Value Proposition</li><li> Determine when you will do a practice meeting before the meeting to master the client experience -practice</li><li> Determine how you will record the meetings -record and document and paperwork</li><li> Determine what technology you will use in the meeting -enhanced client experience</li><li> Determine what else you would add to this list -improvements <br/>  </li><h3> Keep this list handy</h3><p> <br/> As you can see we combined several key practice management drivers of success into one client meeting. Having the ideal client experience is not just dependent on relationship. It is a process, which takes time to build, articulate and practice. If you want to improve your processes, which I am sure you do, keep and use this list as a guide for your financial advisory practice. Our goal is simple, to help one million people get a quality financial plan and advice through a financial advisor. How many ideal people are you helping this year?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 17:48:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-17 17:48:26.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_EGRIXIn.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/two-critical-questions-for-an-ideal-client-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"9304\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 17:48:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 17:48:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"two-critical-questions-for-an-ideal-client-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9303\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4445\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Two-Critical-Questions-for-an-Ideal-Client-Experience.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"946\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455811200,"author_id":188,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s a coming-of-age tale. It&rsquo;s about Uber&rsquo;s attempt to transform its purpose and cement a new reputation&mdash;to change not only how it is perceived throughout the world, but how it perceives itself.</p><p> If transforming Uber&rsquo;s purpose and cement a new reputation was the goal, then not only has the outcome of this exercise been subjected to creative ridicule, soon it will be apparent how operationally ineffective the work was in achieving these stated goals.</p><p> Reading through the article, we quickly understand why this rebrand has missed the mark and how damaging it will actually be to the company in the long term:</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing, though. Kalanick is not a designer. He&rsquo;s an engineer by training and an entrepreneur by nature. Yet he refused to entrust the rebranding to anyone else. This was an unusual decision. Most CEOs hire experts&mdash;branding agencies that specialize in translating corporate values into fonts and colors&mdash;or tap an in-house team. Not Kalanick. For the past three years, he&rsquo;s worked alongside Uber design director Shalin Amin and a dozen or so others, hammering out ideas from a stuffy space they call the War Room. Along the way, he studied up on concepts ranging from kerning to color palettes. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know any of this stuff,&rdquo; says Kalanick. &ldquo;I just knew it was important, and so I wanted it to be good.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know any of this stuff, I just knew it was important and so I wanted it to be good.&rdquo; Brand strategists, designers and creatives around the world will no doubt recoil in horror and and disdain for the phrase &ldquo;I wanted it to be good.&rdquo; No more vague of a direction has or ever will be given to a designer. No worse reason for a rebrand will you ever find, and no poorer or subjective an outcome will you ever find than an outcome that starts with &ldquo;I wanted it to be&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><h3> Brand strategy and subsequent branding is not about a single oligarch demanding something &ldquo;be good.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> It is not about any one stakeholder and it is certainly not work that should be led by someone who has neither the experience, natural skill or self-awareness as CEO Travis Kalanick.</p><p> Branding or rebranding is the visual manifestation of the heart and soul of an organization. It is based on a balanced and exhaustive understanding of the needs of all stakeholders in an organization. In Uber&rsquo;s case, that would be shareholders, leadership, drivers, employees, communities, partners etc, yet none of these stakeholders were consulted, interviewed or sought out to help inform a direction that would ultimately turn into a visual representation. You might ask what a driver would be able to tell us about logo design or what the community cares about color palettes, but to ask this question is to miss the point. We don&rsquo;t want to know their color preferences or design suggestions. We want to know what&rsquo;s important to them. We want to know what Uber means today and what they want it to mean tomorrow. We want to know how Uber impacts their lives, we want to know what it would mean to them if Uber went away tomorrow. We want to hear their suggestions, their complaints and their deeper desires.</p><p> Certain outlets criticised the fact this rebrand took almost three years to complete. When done properly, with the requisite research, discovery, interviewing it takes to understand the needs of a subsection of all stakeholders, this timeline, considering the size of the company, is not unreasonable. What is unreasonable and frankly, downright negligent, is taking three years to work on a design informed solely by the vain needs of a single stakeholder:</p><p> As they sketched on the wall and sifted through materials, the group began to focus on  <u>  <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/bits-atoms-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a blog post Kalanick had written  </a> </u> , in which he described Uber&rsquo;s culture as the combination of bits and atoms. Bits represented the machine efficiency involved in Uber&rsquo;s mapping and dispatch software. The atoms represented people. The concept stuck&hellip;</p><p> So, this entire exercise was designed to line up with Kalanick&rsquo;s singular view of the company and the world, as if he was the only resident of either. Creating a visual identity and deep rebrand without being fully informed of the needs of the stakeholders and the deeper company issues that it is designed to address is akin to designing a suit for a man you&rsquo;ve never met, have no idea of his measurements, his ideal colors or his budget. It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p><h3> I can get a logo for $5, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean any more than I have a $5 logo.</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a reason that companies invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in brand strategy. Because the deliverable is more than a book of designs and colors; it is the roadmap for the direction of the company for the next 5, 10 or 20 years. Something a $5 logo will never get you and something that an ego-led rebrand will similarly not get you.</p><p> <strong>  Mr. Kalanick, you are the proud owner of a logo and color palette that took three years and hundreds of thousands of dollars of labor, and that&rsquo;s all you have. </strong> It&rsquo;s as useful to the company as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/about+as+useful+as+a+chocolate+teapot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   chocolate teapot  </a> </u> .</p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 18:00:48.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-17 18:00:48.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Gfdxmfb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-ubers-rebrand-has-already-failed/\", \"post_id\": \"9307\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 18:00:48\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 18:00:48\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-ubers-rebrand-has-already-failed\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9306\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4447\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Ubers-Rebrand-Has-Already-Failed.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1248\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455797700,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

They just have a certain agenda at a certain time.&rdquo; &mdash;Michael Jai White</p><p> <strong>  Hidden agendas make it impossible to unite your team and achieve shared success. </strong> They destroy trust and eliminate any hope for transparency. When hidden agendas are in play in your organization, your team is divided and it is every man for himself. When leaders and employees have their own agenda, they are looking out for their own best interest and not the interest of the whole.</p><h3> Hidden agendas reveal motives</h3><p> <br/> When you, as a leader, have a hidden agenda employees will begin to perceive you as devious. They will start to question your motives, words, and actions. Soon you lose their trust. Without trust, you lose your ability to influence others.</p><h3> Hidden agendas are self-serving</h3><p> <br/> When employees operate based on hidden agendas, they are working toward their own goals and what will benefit them the most. In order for an organization to be successful, every participant must be working toward the same goal.</p><h3> Hidden agendas jeopardize morale</h3><p> <br/> Hidden agendas are perhaps the single greatest morale buster within your organization. They conceal true motives and are in many ways deceiving. Once exposed it can leave your team feeling demoralized and betrayed. When morale has been compromised your effectiveness will suffer.</p><h3> Hidden agendas endanger your company&rsquo;s future</h3><p> <br/> We can&rsquo;t state it emphatically enough &ndash; hidden agendas on many fronts are a threat that reaches beyond the scope of your internal structure. Unfortunately, identifying hidden agendas can be difficult. Addressing them in time can be a real challenge for you as a leader. Here are a few questions that can help shed some light on hidden agendas and help you as a leader before it is too late.</p><h3> Are we driven by our values or by our profits?</h3><p> <br/> When you and your people are driven by values rather than by profits then hidden agendas become less important. When the driving force behind your organization is to put people over profits, honesty above cutting corners, and integrity over deception then the profits will follow.</p><h3> Does our communication foster accountability and growth?</h3><p> <br/> Open communication is the life-blood of a sound organizational structure. But it must go beyond that by holding people accountable for what they say and do. When the lines of communication are flowing and everyone&rsquo;s voice is being heard then hidden agendas are more readily identified and confronted.</p><h3> Are we building strong relationships within our teams?</h3><p> <br/> We accomplish nothing alone. We need the collaboration and participation of every member of the team. In order to be successful, we must build strong relationships within our teams. And, relationships are based on trust; there can be no trust when hidden agendas are in play.</p><h3> Are we working toward shared goals?</h3><p> <br/> If we are not working together toward shared goals, each member of your team will be working toward their own goals. This is where hidden agendas take form. Each team member focuses their energies on doing and getting whatever they need to be successful regardless of how it will affect the success of the team as a whole.</p><p> None of us set out to intentionally undermine the success of our organization but, this is exactly what happens when hidden agendas are at work. <strong>  Our motives become questionable. Our actions become self-serving. We jeopardize morale. And, we end up endangering the future of our company. </strong></p><p> Our objective here is to not only raise awareness to the pitfalls of hidden agendas but to show a better way. The strength of your organization is found in its people working together toward shared goals and values. When hidden agendas are put to rest then the team can move forward together.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-17 18:25:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-17 18:25:51.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_HTPEprl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-hidden-agendas-impact-organizational-success/\", \"post_id\": \"9309\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-17 18:25:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-17 18:25:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-hidden-agendas-impact-organizational-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9308\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4448\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Hidden-Agendas-Impact-Organizational-Success.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1202\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455915000,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4285,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"For Better Sleep, Teach Your Kids Good Habits","link":"for-better-sleep-teach-your-kids-good-habits","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It is becoming quite apparent to those of us in sleep medicine that children and adolescents are not getting enough sleep.</h3><p> <br/> I believe there are two major reasons for this, the first being that some parents really don&rsquo;t have a clue as to how much sleep their children need. However, the second and more extensive is the proliferation of electronics in the bedroom and the failure of parents to take charge and set limits.</p><p> In a recent study published in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 1,200 Australian high school students were studied. They completed a questionnaire assessing electronics use and sleep duration. Sleep duration on schooldays was reported to be less than optimal by 71% and by 53% on weekends. In one out of five, the major cause for a delayed bedtime was use of electronics. In fact, 10% were deemed pathologically addicted to electronic devices.</p><h3> We know that lack of sleep in children and adolescents has severe consequences.</h3><p> <br/> Among these are irritability, problems with impulse control, inattentiveness, and depression. Additionally, childhood obesity and early onset diabetes can be linked to insufficient sleep.</p><p> The good news is that you as a parent can make a big difference. In the 2014 National Sleep Foundation (NSF) Sleep in America poll it was clear that parents can make a big difference. When parents enforced such things as bedtimes, caffeine drinks, and how late electronics could be used, their children slept on average almost one hour more than those who did not. In addition, roll modeling is important. Children of parents who have interactive electronics in their bedrooms are far more likely to have them as well.</p><p> What is the take-home message? First, educate yourselves about how much sleep your children require. A school-aged child of six to twelve should be getting 10 to 11 hours while a high school student needs 9 to 10. Second, don&rsquo;t be afraid to set some rules.

{"original_id":4286,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Having A Client Service Model Matters","link":"why-having-a-client-service-model-matters","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It&rsquo;s no surprise when we set out to grow a business that we tend to approach it with an &ldquo;arms wide open&rdquo; mentality, ready to take in and serve whatever comes our way for the sake of evolving, learning and earning.</h3><p> <br/> In the beginning it seems feasible that there&rsquo;s no need for a defined model or method to the madness in how you service your clients. It might seem you don&rsquo;t have enough clients to justify the time it can take to sit down and outline a model for how you can continue to make your clients happy, while working and growing your business. We often become victim to the almighty &ldquo;Assumption Gods&rdquo; thinking the effort of creating a client service model takes more time than it&rsquo;s worth. However, not ALL clients are created equal. Some will make us more money than others, some will take more time than others and some refer us more business than others.</p><p> Over time, we realize we haven&rsquo;t actually tracked when we last spoke to some of our clients. Did we send our best client a birthday greeting? A gift for their new baby? A housewarming gift for their new home&mdash;now that it&rsquo;s been over one year?</p><p> What just happened? You have officially passed the point of being proactive with your clients, and crossed over into the dangerous territory of reacting to your clients.</p><h3> Now you should worry&mdash;a lot.</h3><p> <br/> Whatever the product or service you sell, one of the biggest mistakes in business is the tendency to discount the impact of a defined client service model. Which raises the question - what good is all of your hard work and amazing service if you don&rsquo;t have a plan for keeping your clients happy and coming back for more? Even more critical - are you keeping the right clients to facilitate satisfaction and growth?</p><p> Here are some simple guidelines to help you create your client service model:</p><li> <strong>  Review your entire list of clientele </strong>  &ndash; This IS tedious and time consuming but worth the initial investment. You really only have to do this ONCE. Afterwards, it&rsquo;s just maintenance. As long as you continue to only work with the right people.</li><li> <strong>  Categorize your clients </strong>  &ndash; Once you&rsquo;ve scrubbed your list, categorize each client as an &ldquo;A,&rdquo; &ldquo;B&rdquo; or &ldquo;C&rdquo; priority, i.e., &ldquo;A&rdquo; = a prime client, &ldquo;B&rdquo; = a good client, worth &ldquo;some investment of time&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; = is not a high priority but still worth keeping on the list.</li><li> <strong>  Identify clients &amp; prospects to remove </strong>  &ndash; Very important. In order to grow the business you want and deliver an overall experience that will set you apart from your competitors, you must spend your time on the right clients, and this means you may have to fire some of them. No one said it would be easy&mdash;but it will be WORTH it.</li><li> <strong>  Create your transition plan </strong>  - Decide on how the conversation for transitioning some of your clients will go. Identify the partners who can be helpful in making this seamless for these exiting clients. Create a script--what you want to convey and how it will sound. Remember - it&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s how you say it.</li><li> <strong>  Identify the elements of your model </strong>  - What good is a client service model if it&rsquo;s empty? Decide what actions and offerings you will use to complete your model to ensure you have satisfied clients.</li><li> <strong>  Build Your Model </strong>  - Start aligning the elements of your model--who and how. This includes frequency of contact, levels of the experience and even types of communication.</li><li> <strong>  Input your clients </strong>  - Start plugging your &ldquo;A&rdquo; clients and prospects into the model. Then review to determine how you will split your time and with whom, i.e., how high is their referral rate? Are they a center of influence, etc.? Then move to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; clients, and so on.</li><li> <strong>  Follow your model </strong>  - Once created, stick with the model; communicate the model to your team and ensure it is followed by them The team must be on board--know who you&rsquo;re serving, how you&rsquo;re serving them, who&rsquo;s serving whom and how often. Treat this model as an evolving plan - change it when you see the need, or come up with more awesome sauce to make your clients happy.</li><li> <strong>  Spend your time on the right people and prospects </strong>  - Always keep them coming back for more. <br/>  </li><h3> And here&rsquo;s a little crumb for all of the visual learners out there: <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ServiceModel_Inforgraphic_jpeg.jpg\" width=\"927\"/></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 15:03:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 15:03:52.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Fr3lqxD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-having-a-client-service-model-matters/\", \"post_id\": \"9315\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 15:03:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 15:03:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-having-a-client-service-model-matters\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9313\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4451\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Having-A-Client-Service-Model-Matters.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2116\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456057800,"author_id":277,"chart_url":""}

Should small businesses engage and spend the time to create a page, and how do they stack up against a personal page? </strong></p><p> Not all LinkedIn features should be treated as the same. In my experience most are extremely effective, while others are not. Company Pages is one feature we&rsquo;ve found quite ineffective for our members&rsquo; clients.</p><h3> The reason? People like to do business with People, not companies.</h3><p> <br/> Think about it for a moment. Do you do business with your favorite vendor because of the company? Or is it because the salesperson provides you impeccable services? If that salesperson left to go to the competition, chances are, you would follow them.</p><p> So instead of spending your valuable time creating a Company page, divert that time to making your Personal profile shine above the rest.  <a href=\"http://blog.linkfluencer.com/10-steps-to-creating-a-powerful-linkedin-profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Click here </a>  to read a previous article where we provided 10 steps you can take to build a compelling profile.</p><p> Below we&rsquo;ve broken down 3 key reasons why your personal profile is the key driver to success on LinkedIn and why you should focus your efforts there compared to setting up a company page. The first reason why we recommend focusing on your personal page rather than your company page is because people buy into people, not companies.</p><p> Gone are the days where people buy into company brands or products, sure this is still important, but nowadays people are buying more into the people behind the brand or service.</p><p> Did you know that every day there are over 1 billion searches for names and companies on LinkedIn and that &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; section is the second most viewed page on the internet?</p><p> This is why having a compelling LinkedIn profile is paramount not only to your success on LinkedIn but business as a whole given its your face to the online networking world and your first point of contact when promoting yourself to potential clients, joint venture partners, journalists and the business world.</p><p> Your personal profile is a goldmine of information about your work history, company information and details that allow you to connect directly with your target market.</p><p> There is more than enough real estate to inject keywords and phrases that appeal to your audience. Not only can you craft a compelling headline and summary, but you can utilize the experience, projects and publishing feature to show off your knowledge while successfully optimizing your profile.</p><h3> All of these areas help you connect with your clients, connections and prospects in such a way that no corporate entity can.</h3><p> <br/> In addition, with an interesting personal page, you are more likely to drive traffic to your website, where connections can learn about your business, services and more details about your company.</p><p> With a company page, you are limited to a short summary to describe your business and a few slider images. There is very limited real estate to connect with your visitors.</p><p> Sure you can share your company&rsquo;s demographics, as well as a link to your website, but company pages typically receive fewer visits, yielding in less website traffic.</p><p> Another reason why we prefer personal pages over company pages is because if you&rsquo;re a small business owner with less the 20 employees it can be somewhat of a disadvantage as potential clients will see that your company is quite small and may lose confidence in dealing with you.</p><p> Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m sure you have the best services or products going around, but if you advertise your company size, it could cause you to lose credibility with a potential prospect simply based on their first impression.</p><h3> They may only see the size of your company and disregard the true value that you can add to their company.</h3><p> <br/> However, with a personal page, you do not need to disclose how many employees you have, the year when you established, or even your business address. Instead, you can spend your time engaging your connections with hopes of a direct connection, website visit or new lead for your business.</p><p> And the third reason why we recommend building your business through your personal profile as compared to your company page is because there is very little opportunity to engage with your followers since a company page only allows you to post updates to the page, rather than publish full pieces or connect with your audience on a one on one personal level.</p><p> In addition, there is very little space for keyword optimization. In a personal page, you have many different areas where you can drop a popular keyword here and there. This helps you rank higher in advanced searches and capture more leads. With a company page however, you only get the summary section to tell your company&rsquo;s story.</p><p> As a business owner, you need to ensure that your time is well spent. <strong>  Based on our experience you are more likely to see a greater return on your time focusing on your Personal Profile rather than a Company Page. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 15:17:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 15:17:59.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_jWUOGrd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/linkedin-personal-vs-company-page/\", \"post_id\": \"9316\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 15:17:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 15:17:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"linkedin-personal-vs-company-page\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9313\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4452\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Having-A-Client-Service-Model-Matters.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"305\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455878700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

For instance, according to Rick Rieder, BlackRock&rsquo;s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income and  <a href=\"https://www.blackrockblog.com/author/rick-rieder/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  regular Blog contributor </a> , January jobs data suggested the most recent U.S. economic cycle may be cresting and turning downward, with slower payroll gains ahead.</p><p> But though millennials may have been born into unlucky economic circumstances, they seem to also be transforming their luck. While millennials are still confronting challenges, this population of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/reports/millennial-generation-research-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   80 million in the U.S.  </a> </u>  is driving broader economic shifts that have long-term consequences. As Rick frequently points out, millennials are breaking with tradition, re-shaping the real estate market and fueling growth of the sharing economy. For more on this, I recently asked Rick for his take on Gen Y.</p><p> Rick, you&rsquo;ve  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.blackrockblog.com/2015/04/29/care-rising-cost-college/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussed at length  </a> </u>  the implications of the rising cost of college on the broader economy. What are some of those factors, and what does it have to do with millennials specifically? </p><p> As many parents struggle to pay for their child&rsquo;s education, some are forced to save less and work longer to prepare for retirement. This has a residual effect on the labor market, as older workers are staying in the workforce longer and making it harder for younger generations to find jobs. Another factor is the student loan situation. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/experian-insights/analyze-this/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent report  </a> </u>  found that student loans have increased 84 percent since the recession, and that 40 million people have at least one student loan with an average balance of $29,000. Among the millennial population specifically, we&rsquo;re seeing more young adults  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/07/29/more-millennials-living-with-family-despite-improved-job-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   living with family members  </a> </u> , putting off homeownership in favor of paying off  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/news/conferences/consumersymposium/2014/panel5/Dettling.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   debt  </a> </u> .</p><h3> What are some other millennial consumption trends that you&rsquo;re seeing? </h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s interesting because in the last decade, we&rsquo;ve  <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   seen robust growth  </a> </u>  in the service sector of the labor market, from professional and business services to leisure and hospitality. We&rsquo;re also seeing a manufacturing malaise due to slowing emerging economies and global trade. I believe that consumption demand patterns among millennials, including an emphasis on quality of life, is somewhat influencing this demand for travel and leisure, tech products and personal services, to name a few. The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.blackrockblog.com/2015/12/11/economic-trends-in-charts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   technology-driven revolution  </a> </u> , which has a downward influence on price, continues to spur solid consumption growth, particularly in the personal services and travel/leisure categories, and is reflective of the generational shift to a newer millennial-oriented economy.</p><p> What about the sharing economy? Is it here to stay? Millennials have really jumped on the sharing economy bandwagon. They&rsquo;re taking a more asset-light stance toward consumption, putting off buying a home in favor of renting, forgoing a car payment and taking Uber, or skipping a hotel in favor of booking a room via Airbnb. This trend really exemplifies the higher volumes/lower prices model we see from places like Amazon, driving more efficient consumption that&rsquo;s not necessarily reflected in traditional economic metrics. In fact, millennial-spurred technological changes are just one of  <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the big-picture trends transforming the U.S. economy that we have yet to see the statisticians fully address  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 16:20:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 16:20:37.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_GwNQn9i.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-millennials-are-changing-the-global-economy/\", \"post_id\": \"9317\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 16:20:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 16:20:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-millennials-are-changing-the-global-economy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9313\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4453\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Having-A-Client-Service-Model-Matters.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"358\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455996600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

As a result we may shy away from offering our ideas or give up altogether in expressing our suggestions.</p><p> There really is a better way to communicate and that is assertively. When we are assertive communicators we are able to state our needs, wants and desires in a clear and concise way while still being respectful of the other person&rsquo;s point of view.</p><p> <strong>  Assertive Communicators speak with clarity and respect. </strong></p><p> To be an assertive communicator we need to:</p><h3> <strong>  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR WORDS </strong></h3><p> <br/> The words we choose reflect on who we are. When deciding on what message we want to share, selecting words that are clear and accurate is essential. So how do we do this?</p><li> Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements that ensure ownership of our thoughts</li><li> Avoid negative and judgmental language</li><li> Try to stay clear of the &ldquo;accusatory you&rdquo;. Instead of saying &ldquo;You are wrong&rdquo; say, &ldquo;I disagree&rdquo;.</li><li> It can be helpful to take the time to find just the right word choice <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  USE FEELING TALK </strong></h3><p> <br/> Leaders know that when they express themselves with honesty, it can be helpful to share their likes and interests. Assertive communicators are never monotone but bring feelings into their conversations.</p><h3> <strong>  VALIDATE OTHER&rsquo;S POINTS OF VIEW </strong></h3><p> <br/> A secret ingredient to having other people listen to us is being able to recognize their perspectives. Even though we may disagree, we first need to validate their challenges or reasons for their decisions. When we tell others that we understand why they may feel a certain way, they will be more likely to tune into what we have to say. The goal is to cultivate a dialogue where both people get a chance to share their opinions</p><p> <strong>  Assertive communicators validate other people&rsquo;s points of view. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  BE PERSISTENT </strong></h3><p> <br/> Assertive communicators don&rsquo;t give up easily if they feel that what they have to say is critical. Of course they stay open-minded, but are always willing to stick with their ideas. To stay persistent it can be helpful to:</p><li> Choose a different way to present your suggestion</li><li> Be aware of the other person&rsquo;s communication style</li><li> Do more research if something doesn&rsquo;t seem right</li><li> Try to reach a compromise with both your choices and theirs <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  BE CLEAR ON OUR DIRECTION </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s nothing worse than trying to persuade someone of a direction when we are not sure ourselves of where we are headed.  <u>  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/01/05/the-best-leaders-use-their-words/#sthash.dSjIv2GD.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Be crystal clear on what you want to say  </a> </u>  and why. Think ahead of how the other person might challenge you and be prepared with meaningful responses.

{"original_id":4290,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Strengthening the Writer - Editor Relationship","link":"strengthening-the-writer-editor-relationship","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Being a good editor involves a lot more than being an expert on grammar and spelling. </strong> Good editors work with writers through every step of the writing process.</p><p> They may set an editorial calendar to help writers come up with relevant topics to write about. They reorganize and restructure documents so that a writer&rsquo;s words flow and make an impact. Good editors also research and fact-check to make sure what a writer says makes sense and doesn&rsquo;t lead to embarrassment.</p><p> All of this requires an open line of communication between writer and editor, as well as a great deal of respect on both ends. Here are five tips to help editors keep the writer-editor relationship strong.</p><h3> 1. Remember who the writer is</h3><p> <br/> Editors might make a lot of changes to a document, but one thing they should never mess with is the writer&rsquo;s voice. At the end of the editing process, the edited piece should still sound like the author wrote it.</p><p> This can be a challenge when working with a writer for the first time, whose voice you&rsquo;re not yet familiar with. At this stage, you may be required to have a few in-person conversations and multiple rounds of editing to get the tone just right, but always remember whose name will be on the finished piece.</p><h3> 2. Know what you&rsquo;re being asked to do</h3><p> <br/> Some writers may want you to fix egregious errors only. Others might want substantial help with organization, consistency and style. It can be frustrating to be asked for a light copy edit when you know the piece needs so much more but, in many cases, this isn&rsquo;t the editor&rsquo;s call.</p><p> Know what&rsquo;s expected of you before you start editing and deliver exactly what the writer asked for. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have an unhappy writer who isn&rsquo;t likely to work with you again.</p><h3> 3. Know your writer&rsquo;s audience</h3><p> <br/> Is the writer producing copy for print or the web? Are they writing for a broad audience or for experts in a certain field? How many people are likely to read the finished piece?</p><p> Learn everything you can about your writer&rsquo;s audience. If you don&rsquo;t think the writing makes sense for that audience, let your writer know and offer suggestions on how to fix things.</p><h3> 4. Meet your deadlines</h3><p> <br/> This goes without saying. If you think you can&rsquo;t meet a deadline, let the writer know immediately. But there should a very good reason. Maybe the scope of the project has changed completely or you&rsquo;ve had a family emergency.</p><p> Even with a good reason, consistently missing deadlines is a great way to permanently damage the writer-editor relationship.</p><h3> 5. Communicate, communicate, communicate</h3><p> <br/> Tips one through four mean you&rsquo;ll need to be in close contact with your writer. Ask lots of questions along the way. For a novice writer, or one you&rsquo;ve never worked with before, explain the changes you&rsquo;re making so they make sense to the writer.</p><p> The right editor has the skills, expertise and finesse to make anyone&rsquo;s words shine. </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 16:36:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 16:36:02.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_bx5O6xh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/strengthening-the-writer-editor-relationship/\", \"post_id\": \"9320\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 16:36:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 16:36:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"strengthening-the-writer-editor-relationship\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9319\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4455\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Strengthening-the-Writer-Editor-Relationship.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"530\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455890400,"author_id":126,"chart_url":""}

OK, so that might not be the case if you&rsquo;re a super-confident Apprentice-type candidate, but if you&rsquo;re a bit modest or shy, it really can be.</p><p> So, if you&rsquo;re not the gloating-type, just how do you identify what makes you different as a candidate?</p><h3> Speak To Your Family/Friends:</h3><p> <br/> It might sound cheesy but no one knows you better than your family and friends &ndash; so you definitely need to sit down with them and ask for their honest opinion on what your best qualities are. OK, so they won&rsquo;t know which areas you excel in in the workplace, but they will know what makes you &lsquo;you&rsquo; and what your best attributes are &ndash; and with some employers, these personal attributes can be just as important. This can be especially true when it comes to working in a small team where personality is key.</p><h3> Question Current/Ex-Colleagues:</h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve established what your key personal qualities are &ndash; it&rsquo;s time to move onto your key skills in the workplace &ndash; and this is where your current and ex-colleagues come in. These guys work/have previously worked with you on a daily basis so they should be able to tell you honestly which areas you excel in &ndash; and what makes you different as an employee. Similarly, these guys might be also be able to point out some key achievements you&rsquo;ve had/projects you&rsquo;ve worked on which you might have excelled in which you&rsquo;ve forgotten about.</p><p> Just a word of warning; choose which current colleagues you want to question carefully. Why? Because if you choose the wrong one ie. one who&rsquo;s well known for liking a bit of a gossip, word could get out that you&rsquo;re looking for a new job which could make things pretty awkward in work &ndash; particularly if your boss gets wind of the news!</p><h3> Review Your Work History:</h3><p> <br/> Once you&rsquo;ve got your key personality and workplace traits nailed down, it&rsquo;s time to look at what you&rsquo;ve personally achieved in your career so far. Consider what projects you&rsquo;ve worked on which have been really successful &ndash; and what your personal contribution to these projects were. If you&rsquo;re a graduate and don&rsquo;t have much work history to go off, don&rsquo;t panic &ndash; just use your university projects/dissertation instead.</p><p> In addition to big projects, also have a think about what ideas you&rsquo;ve had which have benefited businesses and how these ideas came about. Remember; you came up with this idea, not someone else, so this is just one of the things that makes you unique as a candidate.</p><h3> Consider Your Likes &amp; Dislikes:</h3><p> <br/> In addition to your key skills, another key element of what makes you unique as a candidate is your personal likes and dislikes in the workplace. OK, so just to clarify; I&rsquo;m not talking about likes and dislikes as in you like listening to BBC Radio 1 and you hate it when people eat at their desk. I&rsquo;m actually talking about what you enjoy doing in your current role. Why? Because this is another thing that makes you different as a candidate.</p><p> Think about what you enjoy doing in your current role/what you&rsquo;ve enjoyed doing in previous roles &ndash; and how this would benefit a potential employer. For instance, if you genuinely do love analysing data and coming up with insights and reports &ndash; and you have a knack for spotting unusual patterns that most people would overlook, this is definitely going to make you stand out, particularly if you&rsquo;re applying for data-driven roles.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve done all of the above; you should start to have a pretty good idea of who you are as a candidate and what makes you different.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 16:41:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 16:41:32.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_YKO28mD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/job-seekers-how-to-identify-your-key-selling-points/\", \"post_id\": \"9322\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 16:41:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 16:41:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"job-seekers-how-to-identify-your-key-selling-points\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9321\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4456\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Job-Seekers-How-To-Identify-Your-Key-Selling-Points.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1058\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455912000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

I know, I know ... I should probably be happier than I am. I have been waiting so long for this. But when my boss finally gave it to me, it was a 4% increase.. four percent!?!  I feel like I've been working my butt off and now when they finally recognize my contribution, I get a lousy 4% bump. BTW -- its 4% of a very small number to start with - I feel like i'm stuck in quicksand. How the heck can I increase my salary in a meaningful way?</p><h3> A: I feel your pain. You've hit on one of the most frustrating dynamics we face in our careers and one I don't think most people fully understand.</h3><p> <br/> The cruel irony of corporate tenure is that the longer you're employed with a company, the harder it seems to be to get a substantial salary increase. <br/> <br/> You've worked hard, you've been loyal to the company for years, you've got the experience and you know how to get things done in the organization. But when it comes to salary review time ... nuthin. Meanwhile, you watch as shiny new people join the company and deep down inside you just know they're getting paid more than you. Why else would they be so happy? And what's with that Prada laptop case? It better be a knockoff ... Its so frustrating. Then you hear whispers about colleagues who finally got so frustrated that they threatened to quit if they didn't get more money - and voila, they got a big increase. Is that the right move? The nuclear option? <br/> <br/> Unfortunately, like many tough situations you're going to face in your career, there is no rule book for how to handle this scenario.</p><li> <strong>  Do I march into my boss's office and demand a raise? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do I threaten to quit?  </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do I wait patiently and hope for the best? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do I start looking for a new job? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> It's really hard to know what to do. And so, most of us do nothing. We keep working hard. We sit in silence. We quietly bemoan the injustices beset upon us. We complain to our husbands and wives. And we never get what we deserve. </p><h3> <strong>  Here are the four most important things I've learned about raising your salary: </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 1. Avoid ultimatums at all costs. </h3><p> <br/> The \"pay me or I'll quit\" ultimatum is the nuclear option. Its mutual assured destruction. It should only be used when there are no other options available and even then the outcome will almost certainly be bad for everyone. The problem with the ultimatum is that your boss can never unsee it ... like that time you walked into your parent's bedroom without knocking first ... oh dear god no. When you threaten to quit or you resign as a negotiation tactic, you've permanently altered the relationship you have with the company and your manager. So even though it might work in the short term - your boss might give in - you lose in the long term because the bonds of trust have been broken. You effectively held yourself hostage and forced your boss to pay the ransom. There's no fixing that. From that point forward every time your boss looks at you, you'll be the one who bullied her. So when exciting projects come up, new opportunities arise, there will always be this hint of distrust in the relationship such that will make it even hard to get ahead. Some managers just won't negotiate this way at all. They realize that when an employee resigns or threatens to resign that they're already too far gone to save. Moreover, that by rewarding this type of behavior, they set a dangerous precedent for others in the company. This is another reason not to get into ultimatums unless you truly have no other option and you're really prepared to leave the company.</p><h3> 2. Take a longer term view. </h3><p> <br/> Nobody wants to hear this but I'm going to tell you anyways because I learned this lesson the hard way and I want to help you avoid that. When I look back on the early years of my career, I see now that I burned a lot of bridges and a great deal of emotional energy over what was, in retrospect, a pretty insignificant amount of money. I remember caring so much about the difference between my 33,000 salary and the 40,000 I thought I deserved. It really affected me. It had a major impact on my attitude at work, the decisions I made, and ultimately led to a pretty lackluster performance. Eventually I did get the 40,000 I wanted, but at what cost? The thing about income is that your mindset should always be on calculating the expected value of each action you take - you have think about the net present value of the earnings you'll make in your career and make the best decisions to maximize that. And many times that means taking a longer term view - forgoing short term gains to optimize your career path such that it will lead to bigger earnings down the road when you get into bigger salary levels. For example, you could torpedo your relationship with your boss (as I did) to get that 7K salary increase but if it means that 2 years from now when he's at a new company and looking for a new director of marketing that will earn 100K a year ... is he going to choose you? I'm not saying that you should avoid negotiating your salary in the early stages of your career. What I am saying, is that you need to make sure you focus on optimizing your path to the higher income ranges which sometimes means you need to be a bit more patient when the stakes are lower to get to higher stakes faster.</p><h3> 3. Always be working towards a promotion. </h3><p> <br/> You might think this one is self-evident but most people I see are not actively working with their boss towards a promotion. If you aren't, you should be. The fastest path to material salary increase without changing companies is to get a promotion. Annual increases and inflationary adjustments will never change your fundamental salary dynamic. You might slowly earn more but you won't be increasing your income relative to everyone else - you'll just be keeping up. You also won't be changing your salary level which is key to breaking out of the lower end salary ranges and into the higher brackets. Check out myblog on getting promotions for strategies I've used to jump up in my career. The most important thing to know is that you should have a promotion plan at all times and you need to be engaged in an ongoing dialogue with your boss as you work towards achieving it. A promotion isn't something you ask for. It&rsquo;s not a request. It&rsquo;s a journey you embark on over many months with your boss as your partner. </p><h3> 4. Don't job hop - make purposeful moves.</h3><p> <br/> Job hopping is a pretty hot topic at the moment. You can read my  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/blog-1/2014/5/15/the-3-fatal-flaws-of-job-hopping-as-a-career-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  blog </a>  on the subject which explains in detail why I think it&rsquo;s a flawed career strategy. It&rsquo;s no secret that the easiest way to get a significant salary increase is to change companies. Internal promotions and increases tend to be incremental, 2%, 4%, maybe 7%. So the prospect of becoming a free agent can seem alluring. But in the long run, jumping from one company to another every 2 years isn't going to get your where you want to go. It might seem like these jumps are the best way to get meaningful salary increases but in the long term there are diminishing returns as your resume starts to raise red flags for hiring managers who don't want to make a significant investment in a job hopper. It might work in the early stages of your career when you can get a nice salary jump at the new company, but it will actually hurt your chances of landing management and executive level roles down the road where the salary bumps will be so much bigger. Job hopping is pretty short sighted but purposeful company changes at key points in your career actually make a lot of sense. My experience tells me that you need to stay with a company for at least 3-4 years in order to take advantage of all the opportunities to learn and demonstrate your ability to develop and grow. You want to work at a place long enough to show a track record of promotions and role expansions to make you more attractive when you ultimately test the external job market.

Now I was getting to see my own daughter do something I once enjoyed so much.<strong> The dread:</strong>having to pick her up from school after practice and games.<h3> The dread shortly lifted and the excitement was more than I could have ever anticipated.</h3>Her first game was filled with great excitement and I was immediately taken, hooked and obsessed. The cheerleaders didn&rsquo;t&rsquo;t stop for a second, cheering from the bench, the court&hellip; you name it. And the boys, well, they were amazing. As I took a better look at each player I realized that these boys were the same ones that have been playing together since elementary school and man, were they great! You could tell these boys PRACTICED, COMMUNICATED, knew their roles and position on the team. As a result they were near undefeated the entire season.Watching the boys&rsquo; basketball team throughout the season made me realize the power of financial advisory teams and why they do better business. <strong> It&rsquo;s because teams hold each other accountable and operate with more discipline, similar to having an exercise partner.</strong>When you form the ideal advisory team you are each capitalizing on your strengths, just like Ricky was point on the basketball team and Joseph was the rebounder, the same thing holds true for an advisory practice.

{"original_id":4294,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Prove Your Value Proposition Through What You Deliver","link":"prove-your-value-proposition-through-what-you-deliver","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> You know about the importance of a value proposition. It is how to describe the unique benefits of working with you.</h3><p> <br/> It is the first thing you say to someone to differentiate yourself from other financial advisors. <strong>  It is the cornerstone of a financial advisor marketing plan. </strong></p><p> But once clients sign up with you, what do you deliver to them that fulfills the promise that your value proposition makes? How easy is it for the client to relate one to the other? Once you have taken a client far into your process what will remind them of the original description you gave them of the outcome you deliver?</p><p> One of the most perplexing issues we ever uncovered in a client advisory board was for a financial firm that takes pride in the sophistication of its financial plans. They conducted a client survey that included the question &ldquo;my financial plan is regularly updated&rdquo; with the multiple-choice answers yes, no, and I don&rsquo;t know. Strikingly, a significant portion of their top clients answered &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p> Consider this is a firm that spends a lot of time on the phone with their clients. They are constantly looking at what is going on in the economy, with the tax laws, and taking all kinds of other things into account in considering how it would affect their clients. And so they are probably updating client plans internally as often as a couple times a year. How is it possible that a significant number of people did not know when their plan was updated? <strong>  So we asked the client advisory board about it. </strong></p><p> It turns out it was a simple matter of labeling. One of the planners had a habit of putting &ldquo;plan update&rdquo; at the top of the document in which he had adjusted the client&rsquo;s projections for all of the variables they consider. And his clients had no question about when their plans were last updated.</p><p> As a result of that insight at the client advisory board meeting, they instituted a formal process for asking clients about anything that would affect their plan in preparation of a review meeting and send a formal follow-up document that updates clients on their status. All it took to confirm that they were delivering on their value proposition was providing the client a document with the right title.</p><p> Sam is an advisor with a CPA/PFS. Much of what makes him different is the depth of tax analysis he does. Based on that level of skill, he regularly recommends strategies other advisors would not know how to suggest. And by doing so he saves his clients thousands of dollars. But he had a challenge &ndash; despite all of his unique work, he wasn&rsquo;t getting any referrals.</p><p> So we took apart his process. He was clear up front about describing his unique expertise. In his positioning statement he talked about how his clients benefit from his tax saving strategies. So far, so good. Then we looked at his deliverables. And guess what we found.</p><p> We found that Sam delivered the same basic documents that other advisors give their clients. In his case it was an eMoney plan and an IPS.</p><p> On the sample client files we reviewed, we asked about what special strategies he utilized to make the most out of tax opportunities. On some there were no big opportunities to do anything creative. Fair enough. Not everyone will have the right situation to leverage a creative solution. But there were three or four we reviewed where Sam executed a strategy that delivered a significant benefit. One of them involved a charitable trust. Another involved low basis stock. And so we asked what he delivered to the client to show them the benefit. &ldquo;Oh, we use the same plan we always use. We just explained the strategy verbally and then helped them execute it.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  This is where Sam missed a big opportunity. </strong> Sure the client was excited about saving all that money, and probably told a few people about it at the time. But that was years ago. Now, they have no reminder of how Sam&rsquo;s expertise saved them so much money. They have no memory hook they can refer back to. They have nothing they can describe to friends who may have a similar need except what they might remember of the specifics of their situation. If one of their friends has a different opportunity to leverage the tax code and save money, it doesn&rsquo;t occur to the client to mention Sam because it is a little different than his own situation (even though they are both tax strategies) and so it does not occur to the client to refer Sam.</p><p> <strong>  A lot of advisors miss opportunities similar to the way Sam is missing his. </strong> Many financial advisors we work with on their marketing plans have given a lot of thought to their value proposition and to the services that they provide but end up giving them the same deliverables many other advisors provide. They miss the opportunity to hand the client a document and say, in effect, &ldquo;look! Here it is! Exactly what we told you we would do for you.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  There are several simple ways you can prove to your clients that you are delivering on your value proposition and give them easy ways to remember what to talk about when they refer you: </strong></p><h3> Put the right title on your client documents</h3><p> <br/> Like the firm I referred to above, all it might take to remind clients that you are fulfilling your promise is to name the document you deliver to them the same thing you said you would originally. In their case it was &ldquo;plan update.&rdquo; Yours might be tax analysis, legacy plan, retirement projection, or benefits analysis.</p><h3> Show them a checklist</h3><p> <br/> You know how many things you review when you analyze a client&rsquo;s situation. You know how many different possibilities you consider and how many &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; you evaluate. But the client has no idea how hard you worked on developing their strategy. One easy way to give them some insight into the depth of your process is to include a checklist in the plan you deliver. List off all of the standard situations you evaluate. All of the possibilities you consider. You might even give them a brief statement of the outcome of the different alternatives you tested. It may only be a couple words or a quick number and the purpose may only be to show them that the benefit is not large enough to pursue. What it proves is how much work you did for them.</p><h3> Make your process graphic a template</h3><p> <br/> I have written before about the value of having an easy to follow graphic to describe the process you take clients through. One easy application of this graphic is to convert it into a template that gets customized with each client&rsquo;s information as they progress through the process. Our coaching process takes an advisor through seven steps that we illustrate with a mind map. When a new advisor signs up we customize the mind map for them and gradually complete the map with their information. They can compare their own mind map with the one we showed them initially and see that we have addressed each of the areas we promised we would.</p><h3> Adopt a tool not utilized by most advisors</h3><p> <br/> One advisor I worked with differentiated himself from other advisors by focusing on the dynamics of married couples and helping them work more effectively together as a team. One of the fundamental aspects of the work was to help couples understand each other and their perspectives on money. We found a tool, Financial DNA, that guides clients through a quiz and gives them a report on their money personality. He adopted this tool to help each individual in a couple discover and appreciate the perspective of their partner. It is a tool that is used by only a relatively small number of advisors and he is one of very few who use it in that particular way. And it puts something in the hands of clients that they will not get from most of the other advisors they meet.</p><p> Of course, you could design a custom plan or report that highlights each of the special areas your process addresses. And if you are ambitious it would certainly set you apart. However, you can accomplish plenty, and prove to clients you are delivering on your unique value proposition, without going through all the trouble (or compliance approvals) of developing an entirely customized document. Just review what you tell clients makes you different upfront and make sure that what you hand them at the end of the process illustrates it.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 17:26:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 17:26:49.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Mmk4QKb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/prove-your-value-proposition-through-what-you-deliver/\", \"post_id\": \"9328\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 17:26:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 17:26:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"prove-your-value-proposition-through-what-you-deliver\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9327\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4459\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prove-Your-Value-Proposition-Through-What-You-Deliver_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"648\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455961500,"author_id":452,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4295,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"China's Economy, the Stock Market and Donald Trump","link":"chinas-economy-the-stock-market-and-donald-trump","source_link":null,"content":"<p> So far this year, checking your investment account balances could lead to an upset stomach, or worse. You are better off watching the historically unusual 2016 presidential campaigns. That way, you have enough to distract you from making a bad investment decision &hellip; even if Donald Trump or others upset your stomach.</p><p> What would a bad decision be? Here are several worries you may have, stated as &ldquo;oh no,&rdquo; along with a description of the potential bad investment decision:</p><h3> &ldquo;Oh no, stocks are too risky, I&rsquo;m moving my money over bonds instead&rdquo; &ndash; a.k.a., changing your portfolio allocation</h3><p> <br/> If you (and your advisors) constructed a good long-term portfolio, then stick to the allocation in your portfolio. At present, the return on most bonds is less than the rate of inflation, after income taxes. The return on money markets is even less. So, unless you have amassed huge sums, you need the stock market returns to reach your financial goals.</p><p> That means you have to stay in stocks, and ride out the current downturn.</p><p> &ldquo;But does that work?&rdquo;</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take the last big market dive of 2008 as an example. Measuring stock performance from 2008 through 2012, &ldquo;the S&amp;P 500 generated a cumulative return of 8.6 percent.&rdquo; See  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/24/went-to-cash-heres-the-next-big-mistake-youll-make.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Went to Cash? Here&rsquo;s the next Big Mistake You&rsquo;ll Make  </a> </u> .</p><p> Have you seen any bonds paying 8.6%?</p><p> &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p> I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><p> True, there are alternate investments, such as hedge funds, precious metals, commodities and raw materials, which could perform better than bonds. However, each has different risks and expenses, and some of these have high barriers to entry. If any of these investments do belong in your portfolio, they are there to balance your other investments, which must still include stocks.</p><h3> &ldquo;Oh no, investing is too risky, I&rsquo;m putting my savings in cash for now&rdquo; &ndash; a.k.a., attempting to time the market</h3><p> <br/> Pulling out of the market when it goes down and then putting all that cash back in just before it goes back up sounds great. However, the problem with market timing is no one can do it. Looking at 2008 through 2012, &ldquo;If an investor missed the 36 percent drop in the S&amp;P 500 in 2008 &mdash; or even worse, bailed on the markets mid-carnage &mdash; they probably also missed the 26 percent gain in the S&amp;P 500 in 2009, and the next three positive years for the index that followed. See  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/24/went-to-cash-heres-the-next-big-mistake-youll-make.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Went to Cash? Here&rsquo;s the next Big Mistake You&rsquo;ll Make  </a> </u> .</p><p> So, you are thinking that 2008 to 2012 is an aberration.</p><p> &ldquo;Yes, I still want to move to cash.&rdquo;</p><p> Then consider 1970 to 2016, where, if you missed just the best 25 days out of 11,620 trading days, &ldquo;your returns would have gone from 1,910% to 371%, or [from] 6.7% a year to 3.4%. To give you an idea of how lousy that is, 1-month U.S. T-bills returned 4.9% over the same period.&rdquo; See  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-missing-out-on-25-days-in-the-stock-market-over-45-years-costs-you-dearly-2016-01-25\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   How missing out on 25 days in the stock market over 45 years costs you dearly  </a> </u> .</p><p> The challenge of timing the market is capturing the best days. However, Nobel laureate William Sharpe &ldquo;found that market timers must be right an incredible 82% of the time just to match the returns realized by buy-and-hold investors.&rdquo; See  <u>  Why you should stay in the stock market </u> .</p><p> Are you that lucky?</p><p> &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><h3> &ldquo;Oh no, China is a total mess, this time is different, I&rsquo;m am getting out of stocks forever&rdquo; &ndash;a.k.a., attempting predict the future</h3><p> <br/> True, the slowing of the Chinese economy is causing economic problems worldwide. But, in terms of the impact on stock markets worldwide, that is not dramatically different from the 1987 crash, only then it was Japan.</p><p> &ldquo;Yes, but my friends are selling stocks &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> Did you know that the individual investor is a contrary indicator for the stock market?</p><p> &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p><p> Historically, when individual investors are selling, that is a market low, a good time to invest. Similarly, when individual investors are putting everything into the stock market, that is a market peak and a time to sell the over-priced stocks.</p><p> By the time you realize that you are mistaken, you will have missed much needed performance. For emphasis, consider this:</p><p> From 1990 to 2005 a $10,000 investment would have grown to $51,354 had you just sat tight from beginning to end. However, if you had missed the best 10 days in that 15-year period, your returns would have dwindled to $31,994; if you had missed the best 30 days, you&rsquo;d be looking at a mere $15,730.  <u>  Why you should stay in the stock market </u> .</p><h3> &ldquo;Oh no, investing is too risky, I put my savings in cash&rdquo; a.k.a., thinking short-term, another argument for going to cash</h3><p> <br/> The stock market has to be risky, otherwise there would be no reward for investing.</p><p> &ldquo;But I like cash!&rdquo;</p><p> Cash is not volatile, but it is still &ldquo;risky&rdquo; &ndash; the return on cash &ndash; the interest earned &ndash; is less than the rate of inflation. Over time, investing only in cash puts you far behind, while long-term investing reduces the risks of stocks. The key is, you have to withstand the downturns to gain from the upturns:</p><p> A study by SEI Investments reviewed all the bear markets since World War II. According to the study, reported in The Wall Street Journal, stocks rose an average of 32.5% in the 12 months following the bear-market bottom. Yet, if you missed the bottom by just a week, that return fell to 24.3%. Waiting three months after the market turned cut your gain to less than 15%.  <u>  Why you should stay in the stock market </u> .</p><h3> &ldquo;Oh no, I need money to buy a house&rdquo; &ndash; a.k.a., having the wrong investment strategy</h3><p> <br/> What was your short-term investment doing in the market in the first place?</p><p> &ldquo;I need my money to double so I can buy my dream house!&rdquo;</p><p> Sorry, if you need that much then your dream is wrong.</p><p> For the stock market, anything less than 5 years is &ldquo;short term.&rdquo; If you have money set aside for a vacation, new car or other major purchase, like a house, those funds need to be invested more conservatively, taking less risk. Otherwise, while you could double your money in a couple of years, you could also end up with much less.</p><h3> &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; a.k.a., the conclusion, an important message &ndash; don&rsquo;t forget it:</h3><p> <br/> After watching investors for several decades, I know this to be true: you must create a good investment strategy and stick to it for it to work.</p><p> Even if do not have an optimum strategy, your investments will perform far better than someone who keeps altering their strategy.</p><p> &ldquo;But the fund I have didn&rsquo;t do as well as another fund last year, so I am selling &hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> Chasing after the last year&rsquo;s star mutual fund usually works out poorly.

My job was to &ldquo;improve customer service by deploying employee scripts.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Given my naivete, I took to my task by researching the best available customer service programs. Ultimately, I purchased a boxed set of materials, developed a communication and training plan, and marched the program right into the organization. There were only 3 problems:</p><p> Leaders throughout the organization said they wanted employee scripts but in no way wanted to monitor or reward performance based on them.</p><p> Employees hated the scripts and didn&rsquo;t understand why we were supposed to use them.</p><h3> Patients felt the scripts were robotic.</h3><p> <br/> Fortunately, through the years I haven&rsquo;t replicated that misguided effort &ndash; lest I would be in some other business today!</p><p> Generally speaking customer service scripts are less effective than desired. It&rsquo;s hard to be authentic and inspired when you are reading someone elses words.</p><p> Conversely, there ARE certain words people use during service which I think we should assist our team members to remove from their vocabulary. Beyond &ldquo;swear&rdquo; words, cutesy cliches, and insults, I encourage my clients to shed these five phrases in the context of service:</p><h3> 1. May I help you</h3><p> <br/> While this sounds benign enough, we don&rsquo;t need to ask permission to provide service. We are paid and poised to serve and the real question should be, &ldquo;How may I assist you?&rdquo; The word assist is a far more engaging and elevated word. Most customers will be assisted although many don&rsquo;t want to be helped.</p><h3> 2. No</h3><p> <br/> Even if you can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a customer&rsquo;s request, you don&rsquo;t have to say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Often a service professional will say something like, &ldquo;Here are the options I do have available&rdquo; or &ldquo;we could do that for this additional price.&rdquo;</p><h3> 3. That&rsquo;s not my job</h3><p> <br/> Need I say more about this one, other than please find the person whose job it is and make a warm handoff&hellip;.</p><h3> 4. Our policy doesn&rsquo;t allow me to&hellip;.</h3><p> <br/> One of my least favorite hiding spots is inside a policy manual. Customers don&rsquo;t care about policies! They care about solutions and options. As human beings we should generate service options until we have exhausted all possible mutually beneficial outcomes. If we are at that juncture it&rsquo;s time to escalate the service need to someone in the organization who may have more options at their disposal.</p><h3> 5. If it were up to me&hellip;.</h3><p> <br/> Anything along this line of conversation is entering dangerous territory. In essence, the service provider is saying&hellip;I would love to be your hero but the villian (our company, my boss) doesn&rsquo;t have my virtues and compassion. I hear these types of statements far too often, as team members try to forge a connection with the customer at the expense of the customer&rsquo;s relationship with the business.</p><p> <strong>  Those are just a few of the phrases I think service professionals should never say! </strong></p><p> What are the ones that trouble you most? More importantly, what are you doing (short of scripts) to elevate the nature of service conversations happening in your organization?</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 18:05:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 18:05:17.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_6RBbJTh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/service-professionalism-neither-scripts-nor-these-5-gems/\", \"post_id\": \"9332\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 18:05:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 18:05:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"service-professionalism-neither-scripts-nor-these-5-gems\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9331\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4461\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Service-Professionalism-\\u2013-Neither-Scripts-Nor-These-5-Gems.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"722\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455908400,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4297,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What You Need To Think About Before Upgrading Your Website","link":"what-you-need-to-think-about-before-upgrading-your-website","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"mailto:marielle.demers@sympatico.ca\">   Marielle Demers  </a> </u></p><p> Is it time to upgrade your website? As discussed in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/why-you-need-a-professional-website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Part 1  </a> </u>  of this series, it is impossible to ignore the fact that most people &ldquo;Google&rdquo; almost everything. <strong>  In fact, according to Nextopia, 86% of Baby Boomers and 90% of Millennials routinely research products online. </strong> For Financial Advisors, a professional and relevant website is becoming so critical to their business that it cannot be ignored. A website not only helps keep Investment Advisors in touch with their clients but will be necessary to gain and service new clients in the future.</p><h3> So where do you start?</h3><p> <br/> You might be feeling that this will take time and may even be a little painful. The best way to begin is to take the steps to have all the aspects of your website well thought out so that it tells a cohesive story about you and your business.  Here are things you should consider before you begin in order to make the process more constructive and maybe even pain free.</p><p> <strong>  1. Carve out some time to work on this. </strong>  Book some uninterrupted time in your calendar to go plan out what your site will look like and what you want your visitors to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; when they come to your site.</p><p> <strong>  2. Take a look at your competitors&rsquo; websites. </strong>  You don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel. Take note of what you like and what grabs your attention. It is also important to note what you don&rsquo;t like or what makes you lose interest. These negatives can be great in helping you avoid some of the pitfalls of a poor website design.</p><p> <strong>  3. Create your BRAND. </strong>  This is very important! Your website is a reflection of you, how you do business and what your strengths and values are. Start by asking yourself these questions:</p><li> What makes you unique?</li><li> What do you like most about your business?</li><li> What do your clients like about you?</li><li> What are your business values?</li><li> How would you like to appear to others? <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4. Create a tagline. </strong>  Taglines are like slogans or mini mission statements that can succinctly describe who you are and what you stand for. Once you have determined your BRAND, you can work at developing a tagline which can be displayed prominently on your website. Just to be clear, this is not a value proposition but a short, catchy phrase which reflects you and your business.</p><p> <strong>  5. Create your topics. </strong>  Topics will be represented in different pages on your website or links found in the navigation bar at the top of your page. Take a look at other sites to get an idea of what you might want to include for example, &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;Products and Services&rdquo;. It is important, however, that you make sure that you have at least one topic that reflects what makes you unique.</p><p> <strong>  6. Create your text. </strong>  Good text is the backbone of your website. This is also where many websites get it wrong. A long, rambling essay is not going to attract the attention of your website visitors. Define what you want to get across about your business, use clear and friendly language, be concise, and be direct. Let them know, in an obvious way, why they should do business with you. Calls-to-Action are important to encourage your visitors to interact with your website.</p><p> <strong>  7. Use professional photos. </strong>  Your visitors want to see a photo of you and your team. Much like house buyers looking at houses online will only consider those which have photos, most people will likely not show interest in your site if there are no pictures. Try to get several different poses of you and your team, including some that seem more spontaneous.</p><p> <strong>  8. Add interest by using stock photos.  </strong> One of the most important things to take into consideration when designing your website is how users think. Think about how you navigate websites when you are online. Most users want instant gratification and a website which gives them interesting and credible information fast. They scan, not read, a website which means you have to grab their attention immediately in order for them to remain interested. You can do this by adding pictures to complement your text. Stock photos are a good way of making your point in an instant.</p><p> <strong>  9. Consider ways to keep your website fresh. </strong>  Keeping your website fresh and updated has probably not been your number one priority and may seem like too much work. However, consider this, updating can result in more traffic to your site, allows you to deliver information in a timely fashion and to more individuals and lets you repeat your BRAND and uniqueness to visitors. On the other hand, not updating your website may create a negative opinion.</p><p> There are many ways to keep your site updated by blogging, creating newsletters, market updates, and demonstrating community involvement. How you do it will probably depend on your firm and what support they provide.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 18:19:40.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 18:19:40.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ESoVJts.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-you-need-to-think-about-before-upgrading-your-website/\", \"post_id\": \"9334\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 18:19:40\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 18:19:40\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-you-need-to-think-about-before-upgrading-your-website\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9333\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4462\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-You-Need-To-Think-About-Before-Upgrading-Your-Website.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"644\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455904800,"author_id":268,"chart_url":""}

Leaders","link":"how-i-use-family-systems-to-teach-managers-v-leaders","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Whenever I teach Family Systems Theory to management students, I begin my talks with a simple question, \"What is a manager?\"</h3><p> <br/> If you just suffered a wave of nausea, felt an urgent desire to break something, or experienced an urge to uncontrollably curse, then you know why I like to begin my lectures with such a loaded question.</p><p> In the internet of memes, you're either a manager (pathetic, despicable, unworthy) or a leader (awe-inspiringly awesome).</p><p> If you've ever been a manager (I have been one) or worked with one (you probably have), you know that the real world experience of managers and management is neither clean nor black and white. More to the point - leadership, like so many things, is in the eye of the beholder. Memes and tropes are fun diversions, but they are useless when it comes to the daily grind of succeeding in the workplace.</p><p> A Manager is an employee of a company empowered with resources - human and capital - towards the completion of a goal.</p><p> For me, this simple, purpose-oriented definition helps separate what a manager is tasked with doing - completing a goal - from whom I would like them to be - inspiring me as a leader. This is why I ask the question. You see, in my experience, the manager's job is to get the job done. It is their job to marshall me as a resource in making that happen. By contrast, being a \"leader\" is not part of the definition simply because my beliefs about what they must do to be a leader to me are entirely beyond their control. </p><p> Therein lies the reason the binary manager-leader paradigm / fantasy fails. When it comes to leadership, it doesn't matter what kind of leader I think I am. What matters is what type of leader others think I am. Which, I can tell you from personal experience, can be both widely varied and, like some parent-child relationships, incredibly volatile.</p><p> I've been screamed-at by people who believe I'm an incompetent a--hole. I've been complimented by people who (claim they) love working under (and being mentored by) me. Both are true. But is one truer than the other? </p><p> The Car Accident is a thought-exercise I like to play with students, one you might consider trying out at the water cooler with your co-workers or employees. Here's the scenario: Imagine you're still in college (I know, that's a long time ago for some of us). It's Saturday, 2am. You're in a minor car accident and (only) your car is damaged. No one is hurt and you have not been drinking, etc (so nothing illegal to worry about). Do you call your parents and tell them right then at 2am? Do you tell them the next day or sometime? Do you never tell them? </p><p> I love this game. How a person defines the problem of the car accident, and the way they socialize the scenario within their family system, helps them to begin to understand how they fit within their 'organization'. Consider this - one person might call and wake their parent at 2am because they're afraid, another might do the same because they want to be comforted. The action may be the same, but its their relationship with the person who has authority over them that dictates why they take the action in the first place. </p><p> What the individual looks for (and gets/doesn't get) from those who have been empowered towards the goal of raising them enables a deeper understanding of the managers they were raised by.</p><p> Which is why, in the workplace, clarifying what a manager is/isn't matters. As with your parents, you are stuck with the manager you've got (unless you plan to quit your job, of course). Maybe they're a loving and supportive and nurturing parent (A Leader!). Maybe, to quote Woody Allen in Manhattan (when talking about his mother), \"they're a castrating Zionist\" (Not A Leader!). Maybe they're somewhere in-between.</p><p> Regardless, the more you can let go of the manager-leader meme, and figure out how to live with the (work) \"family\" you've got, the more successful you'll be. And, hey, if your manager happens to have the ability to lead along the way, well that's just bonus.</p><p> <strong>  Agree? Disagree? Have a different definition of Manager? What would you do in the car accident? Hey, that's what the comments are for! </strong></p> ","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 18:26:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 18:26:01.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_NXTWk50.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-i-use-family-systems-to-teach-managers-v-leaders/\", \"post_id\": \"9336\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 18:26:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 18:26:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-i-use-family-systems-to-teach-managers-v-leaders\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9335\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4463\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-I-Use-Family-Systems-To-Teach-Managers-v.-Leaders.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"474\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456160400,"author_id":275,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4299,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"In Telling Your Story, What Exactly Are You Saying?","link":"in-telling-your-story-what-exactly-are-you-saying","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> We all have stories to tell.</h3><p> <br/> When you tell your business story, it&rsquo;s imperative to showcase your brand in the very best possible light. Which, of course, means that you&rsquo;ve got to know it inside and out, like the palm of your hand.</p><p> The first key in relating a great business story or brand story, is knowing what your brand means today and what you want it to mean in the future.  </p><p> But telling a good story means more than knowing the subject matter. To tell your story most effectively, you&rsquo;ve got to master the art of storytelling.</p><h3> What is Brand Storytelling?</h3><p> <br/> Storytelling is the art of using words and gestures to capture the listener&rsquo;s imagination. Brand storytelling is the use of story to define your business and allow potential customers an opportunity to see how your product or service meets their needs.</p><p> Good storytelling entails both the knowledge of your business and the nuances of interpersonal entertainment. Let&rsquo;s face it: While we all think our business is fascinating, the only way to keep our listeners engaged is with a little entertainment.</p><p> A good story utilizes a variety of elements to entertain and draw in the listeners&rsquo; attention while revealing key aspects of your business. Good storytelling also presents the most relevant aspects of your story for your listeners. In that way, good storytelling requires you to first listen to your listeners. What is it that would motivate them the most?</p><p> I like the simplicity yet powerful types of stories John Jantsch of Duct Tape Marketing outlines in his book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Commitment-Engine-Making-Work-Worth/dp/1591844878/jantschcomm-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Commitment Engine  </a> </u> .</p><h3> The Passion Story: How You Began Doing What You Do</h3><p> <br/> The passion story is a description of why you opened your business. There is almost always a more in-depth reason behind it than simply making money. What is the intellectual stimulation involved? What is the human connection? This type of relating to the customer can include the owner&rsquo;s personal morals and life purpose. It can also demonstrate the values or principles of the owner and underscore his/her worldview.</p><h3> The Purpose Story: Why You Continue Doing What You Do</h3><p> <br/> The purpose story is an extension of the passion story. It can be expanded to include not only the owner&rsquo;s perspective, but also why the employees took a job in this field or with this specific company. These stories include individual missions and how the employees feel the company helps the community through the services it provides. These stories are important to define as they give the employees a sense of their importance and why they do the job they have accepted.</p><h3> The Value Proposition Story: The Customer Value behind What You Do</h3><p> <br/> The value proposition adds an important aspect to your brand storytelling. It not only delves into the whys and wherefores of your brand, but more importantly defines who the ideal customer is and how the product/service is beneficial to them. This kind of storytelling is an opportunity to differentiate your product from the competitors&rsquo; brands. How does your business meet your customers&rsquo; needs? Examples and proofs will help you seal the deal.</p><h3> The Personality Story: Giving Purpose to What You Do</h3><p> <br/> The personality story is a variation of the value proposition story. In this rendition, you reveal what you want your brand to represent and what you are doing to accomplish that. It also describes what makes your brand unique and why your products and services are different than other options available in the market. Furthermore, this kind of story provides you with the chance to influence how you want potential customers to perceive your brand and perceive its utility. This is important to future marketing and sales campaigns.

But at least 50% of your clients lead with a right-brain approach that is based on feelings and relationships.</p><p> With the current market volatility, the fact that you have educated your pre-retirees on withdrawals in a declining stock market means very little when facing hard choices about retiring triggers your client&rsquo;s emotions. They are scared about having to work longer, potentially cutback the &ldquo;dream lifestyle&rdquo; or just having to live with the uncertainty of it all.</p><h3> This fear can be mitigated by one powerful emotion: TRUST</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  But is trust a &ldquo;skill&rdquo; you can sharpen? </strong> While I believe each person has a certain inherent trustability, there are ways you can get beneath the surface of a client to get past their fear factor.</p><h3> 1. Let the client choose how to proceed.</h3><p> <br/> They want to feel like a partner, not being controlled. While you have a formal agenda for each meeting, you might begin the session with a simple question: &ldquo;At the end of today&rsquo;s meeting, what would be a good outcome for you?&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Stay present and open to not knowing exactly what turn the client might take in your meeting.</h3><p> <br/> Be curious as to the &ldquo;threads&rdquo; your client may be unraveling. In your enthusiasm to talk about the carefully crafted portfolio you have designed and the safe withdrawal strategies, your client may be wondering, &ldquo;What impact will all these uncertainties have on my lifestyle?&rdquo; It would be best to acknowledge that fear and go down that path to demonstrate a deeper level of awareness.</p><h3> 3. Listen for and carefully observe energy or tone shifts.</h3><p> <br/> This type of intuition is not always an advisor&rsquo;s strong suit. Your client will give you cues: voice level, eye contact, and pauses. But when you listen to the &ldquo;what&rdquo; (fixed income in retirement) and are able to move to the &ldquo;who&rdquo; (no longer having income from a job, uncertainty of what&rsquo;s next), you will build trust as you get at the client&rsquo;s real fears and help them discover their next best action steps.</p><p> Focus on the one skill that will have the greatest impact on your relationships with both prospects and clients: <strong>  TRUST. And, in return, your clients will face these uncertainties with greater confidence. </strong></p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-18 22:35:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-18 22:35:16.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_5kVPxy5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-four-words-you-never-want-to-hear/\", \"post_id\": \"9339\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-18 22:35:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-18 22:35:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-four-words-you-never-want-to-hear\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9338\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4465\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Four-Words-You-Never-Want-to-Hear.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"873\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1455944400,"author_id":384,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4301,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Chicken Fried & Cold Beer On Friday Night","link":"chicken-fried-cold-beer-on-friday-night","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Can Investors Learn A Few Things From Country Music?</h3>Those of you who know me well know that I am from Alabama and that I still have some Southern boy in me.Those of you who know a little country music may also recognize that the title of this post is based on a Zac Brown Band song, Chicken Fried.<strong> The line in the song that inspired me to write this piece is:</strong>\"Well, it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the mostNot where you live, the car you drive, or the price tag on your clothesThere's no dollar sign on a piece of mind; this I've come to know\"<strong> It goes with the following chorus about what really matters most in life:</strong>\"Cold beer on a Friday nightA pair of jeans that fit just rightAnd the radio upWell, I've see the sun riseSee the love in my woman's eyesFeel the touch of a precious childAnd know a mother's love\"Beyond my having a fondness for good country music lyrics, why is it that a wealth management guy is quoting Zac Brown?<h3> Well, if you stay with me on this, I promise to tie it all together in the end.</h3>I probably don't have to remind many readers that, unfortunately, the market is off to a rocky start this year. Understandably, some investors are concerned.Based on my past experience inside big investment firms, how are some investment product managers and sales professionals likely feeling?<h3> <strong>  Giddy. </strong></h3>As I have<u> <a href=\"/advisor/your-brain-on-the-market\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  written about before </a></u>, Wall Street likes nothing more than a little fear and is off to the races marketing the latest impressively presented strategies designed to protect investors. I am getting multiple emails a day from large investment houses and asset managers selling low volatility funds, down-side protection trades and absolute return funds. The pitches all have implied promises of significant down-side protection, and some are even being sold based on attractive hypothetical returns (yes, I was smiling when I wrote &ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo;).The vast majority have little transparency, however, and, you guessed it, high fees that drive high profit margins.By writing this, I am not suggesting that all of the presentations are improper.What I am saying is that our industry tends to make things too complex and does not give investors enough information about how products are created (translation, the real ingredients) and about how they work, especially when you need them the most (example: many broke down during the last financial crisis).<strong> To be fair to the industry, many of these strategies, which are literally created by rocket scientists, are based on complex investment and economic theories.</strong>What is the key word in this sentence?<h3> <strong>  Theories. </strong></h3>The products tend to be designed based on models that strive to price how multiple investments, which themselves are priced based on multiple factors such as earnings estimates, interest rate and currency projections, and emotion, will perform in various market cycles.Whew, yes, that was a mouthful.What could possibly go wrong with complex models that rely on key words such as \"estimates\", \"projections\", \"emotion\", \"likely\", and \"multiple factors\"?Among the things which make me pause, is that when pressed over \"a cold beer on a Friday night\", I have found that my ex-rocket scientist investment friends from MIT, etc. (one literally was a Nobel Prize finalist) admit that their theories can, and likely will, break down from time to time based on market dislocations that can't be fully factored into their models.Getting back to Zac, my hope that this is starting to spark a few questions among readers as far as what is really important and what really adds value.When I founded my firm almost four years ago, I spent a lot of time asking questions about what adds the most value to clients. During conversations with many wealthy individuals and investment professionals, I was routinely reminded of the following comment from a long-time client:\"Preston, I hired you to help our family develop and implement an investment plan. I am very happy with the management of our investments but do you know what I have come to realize that I really pay you for? Transparency, simplicity and peace of mind.\"Yes, some might think that I am a broken record on this, but as an adviser to President Kennedy is rumored to have told him when he thought he was saying the same things over and over again:\"When you are at the point that you think you are going to get sick if you say it one more time, you have finally reached the point when many people hear it for the first time.\"Some folks seem to be hearing what the evidence points to: a keep-it-simple approach performs just as well as complex strategies.Investors are following the advice of Warren Buffet and David Swenson, the CIO of Yale*, and putting record amounts into index funds (see links to articles on Buffet and Swenson at the bottom of this post).It seems that our industry still has some listening to do, however, as it continues spending an enormous share of its time and money promoting complex products, such as multi-factor models that are designed to protect against market down-turns and defaults (if this doesn't sound familiar, go see the movie or read the book<u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short\" target=\"_blank\">  The Big Short </a></u>).To hopefully help, the following are a few &ldquo;Don't&rdquo; bullets points for Wall Street to consider.<h3> Don&rsquo;t Make Investing A Competitive Sport</h3><li> Each individual is different and can have unique goals</li><li> Remember that winning in investing is reaching client specific goals, not beating the other guy who might have different objectives or an appetite for risk</li><h3> Don&rsquo;t Sell Crystal Balls or Be A Sheep</h3><li> As we all know, but don't want to admit, Wall Street predictions are often wrong (see our recent <u>  Groundhog Day </u> or <u>  Talking Heads </u> blogs)</li><li> Resist the urge to run with the herd and easily sell what has been hot in the past or that is being currently promoted as the next great the New New Thing</li><h3> Don&rsquo;t Avoid Conversations About The Bad or Ugly</h3><li> Fully disclose the Good, the Bad and the Ugly</li><li> If clients understand the pros and cons of a strategy before implementing it, then they will be less likely to change course at the wrong time when the going gets rough, which it will from time to time</li><h3> Don't Forget Taxes, Especially Related to Alternative Investments and Hedge Funds</h3><li> Remember that a very large portion of hedge funds returns tend to come back to clients in the form of short-term capital gains</li><li> If your client is the highest tax bracket, please adjust your return projections down by approximately 50% before making your pitch</li><h3> Don't Underestimate the Advantage of Liquidity</h3><li> Individual clients are not endowments and generally have periodic liquidity needs for large purchases, gifts, and regular income</li><li> Place a premium on fully liquid investments</li><li> Remember that during the financial crisis many endowments found out the importance of liquidity the hard way when they did not have access to funds that they needed</li><h3> Don't Sell Anything That You Don&rsquo;t Fully Understand</h3><li> Do we really understand how complex strategies will perform over various market cycles?</li><li> No additional comments really needed</li>As you can sense, I am a little cynical about how Wall Street sells the fear of missing out by helping to create what data suggest are relatively unproductive competitions to find and sell alpha.Rather than taking the easy way out and simply selling relative performance and relative risk metrics, let&rsquo;s spend more time listening to what clients want to achieve, and implementing strategies that are designed based on their goals, not industry models.Related to this, I am not a big fan of active management but as I recently wrote in<u> <a href=\"/advisor/whats-in-a-name\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  What's In A Name </a></u>, if investing in an active strategy or working with a large brand makes a client feel more comfortable, and will allow him or her to stick to a plan more easily then, regardless of the relative performance versus an index, these might be the correct choices.If we focus on adding true, long-term, goal-oriented value in a fully transparent manner, we may come in for short-term criticism, but in the end I think we'll do the most good.At Fiduciary Wealth Partners, we feel that by focusing on transparency and simplicity, our clients will benefit by being more comfortable with their investments, which in turn will increase the likelihood of them sticking to long-term plans during good times and bad (what many studies show is the key to long-term investing success).<h3> Hopefully this will also increase peace of mind and allow all to enjoy a little more.</h3>\"Cold beer on a Friday nightA pair of jeans that fit just rightAnd the radio upWell, I've see the run riseSee the love in my woman's eyesFeel the touch of a precious childAnd know a mother's love\"* Both Warren Buffett and David Swenson have repeatedly discussed the evidence in favor of index funds and consistently recommended index investing to individual investors.See the following links for more information:<u> <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-to-heirs-put-my-estate-in-index-funds-2014-03-13\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Warren Buffett To His Heirs: Put My Estate In Index Funds </a></u><a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffetts-investing-tip-for-lebron-james-stick-with-an-index-fund-2015-03-02\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Warren Buffett's Advice to LeBron James: Index Funds </u></a><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=WRLNZwZRRLsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=unconventional+success+swenson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=alwUVYOKIeznsASpg4HICA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=unconventional%20success%20swenson&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Personal Investment &ndash;

Conversations about research and a cure for Alzheimer's are important. </strong> What is equal if not more important is helping people live well with the disease.

Denial around aging. </strong>  The denial leads to accidents and health emergencies. Waiting for an acute occurrence creates decision making in crisis mode, in the midst of panic, emotional and time-critical overwhelm. Those decisions end up being less logical, and too many times much more expensive than they needed to be if they'd planned ahead.  <strong>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaronDMurphy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Aaron D.

It's our care culture. </strong> It affects everything we do, and all that we are. Leading by example, modeling tolerance, inclusion and respect of all is a must if we are going to turn this country around. It should be a mandate, of any candidate or government position, not an option.

{"original_id":4303,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Use Digital Listening to Connect with Customers","link":"use-digital-listening-to-connect-with-customers","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  When it comes to getting to know your customers, knowing how to &ldquo;look people in the eye digitally&rdquo; has never been more important. </strong> Picking up the phone is often the last option for most consumers today. They can get everything they need to make a buying decision online for all but the most complex sales. So how can marketers stay close to the customer without having a lot of one-on-one interaction? How can they discover the customer&rsquo;s pain points and glean enough information to say the right things without a lot of face time?</p><h3> <strong>  BECOME A DIGITAL LISTENER </strong></h3><p> <br/> Digital conversation is happening all around us at a breakneck pace, yet many marketers barely scratch the surface when it comes to plugging into those conversations. Trying to pull meaningful information from a river of fast-moving conversation can be difficult&mdash;rather like trying to catch fish in a waterfall with a net. To be effective, digital listening needs to get more personal&mdash;and that means person-to-person listening.</p><p> Social listening tools are getting more sophisticated at picking out phrases and hashtags in social conversation. Even CRM and work management tools give us unprecedented access to the thoughts, interests, and needs of our customers. But we need to do more than just respond to an individual tweet or update&mdash;we need to dig a little to understand the prospect and gain some context first. This is where empowering your customer-facing employees to follow conversations back to the source is important. If you want to know what motivates your customers, take a look at their social profiles. Look at their bios. Watch what they post. What do they complain about? What do they like to share?</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-21-at-6.57.04-AM-2.png\" width=\"477\"/></p><p> When we&rsquo;re talking with someone in person, we depend on visual and auditory cues to learn a little about them, and we listen and look for commonalities. Do they have an accent? Where did they go to school? Do they have children? Are there hobbies you share? If you happen to be in someone&rsquo;s office, you can find some of this information by just looking at photos on the wall or the desk, or simply by asking. Sometimes this information isn&rsquo;t easy to uncover in person&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no such barrier on social channels. Even the most sparsely filled out profile gives you a name, a hometown and a profile photo. You can find plenty of common ground even with that.</p><h3> <strong>  USE WHAT YOU LEARN TO ENHANCE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE </strong></h3><p> <br/> What do you do with this information? Populate your CRM with it, so anyone else in the company who touches that customer has access. Also, consider making this information available on your work management tools, especially when those tools are a touchpoint for your customers. This kind of information gathering should be an integral part of your workflows, so everyone is armed with the kind of information that helps facilitate human-to-human connection.</p><p> In order to make this work, however, your employee communications need to be as open as possible (aside from proprietary and/or private information). As far as your customer is concerned, from marketing to sales to customer service&mdash;the entire customer journey needs to seem effortless.</p><p> After all, there&rsquo;s nothing worse than trying to deal with a brand where the left hand doesn&rsquo;t know what the right hand is doing. Having the right information available to everyone who interacts with your customers can make all the difference in their perception of your brand, and it&rsquo;s one of the best ways to build loyalty and advocacy. It also makes your employees&rsquo; jobs easier and more satisfying. Who doesn&rsquo;t like happy endings? So empower your employees to listen for digital conversations about your company, product or service, and follow those conversations to individual profiles to gather more information.</p><h3> <strong>  BUILD BETTER MARKETING PERSONAS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Digital sleuthing can also add the kind of texture that helps your marketing team build more useful marketing personas. Personas rich with insights and customer mindsets helps your marketing team come up with more relevant, compelling content that has a much higher likelihood of resonating with your audience. This is absolutely necessary if you want your content to cut through the noise, grab your prospect&rsquo;s attention and keep it long enough to generate action.</p><h3> <strong>  PUT IT ALL TO WORK </strong></h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/ted-talks-about-looking-people-in-the-eye-digitally-video/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Looking people in the eye digitally  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  really isn&rsquo;t all that different from face-to-face listening&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a faster way to glean the kind of information that makes relationship-building easier and communication more effective.</p><p> People share more information about themselves online than they think they do. Making it a point to search individual profiles for those clues is a type of digital listening that can make a huge difference for your company. It can help you create more compelling marketing materials, ensure excellent customer experience, and provide greater job satisfaction for your employees.

{"original_id":4304,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Bulls**t Excuses Holding Women Leaders Back","link":"bullst-excuses-holding-women-leaders-back","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> One of the most formative moments in my childhood came when my dad told me to saddle up my horse Sugar and ride with him to help Uncle Bob move several hundred of cattle to Bear Creek.</h3><p> <br/> We lived on a cattle ranch in Wyoming and I felt certain that, since I was a girl, my brother would be the one chosen to trail cattle and I&rsquo;d be left behind peeling potatoes with mom. Smug with joy, I rode out of the corral, tossed the potato peeler at my brother as I passed by, and sat tall in the saddle.</p><p> It was a day that changed my life because I had stolen a glimpse into a future where I didn&rsquo;t have to listen to bulls#*t excuses that could hold me, and other women leaders, back.</p><p> Here are four:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Caving In To Stereotypes </strong></h3><p> <br/> Somewhere on that ride to Uncle Bob&rsquo;s ranch, I understood that I didn&rsquo;t have to be held prisoner to a stereotype&mdash;no staying behind with the women and swapping double-crust pies recipes for me. I was a cowboy&mdash;I mean, a cowgirl. A few years later, I became an FBI agent. If I thought the world of cowboys was full of stereotypes, I came across a few more in the masculine-dominated world of law enforcement.</p><p> <strong>  My philosophy was this: someone stupid enough to rely on stereotypes is stupid enough to make really stupid mistakes. </strong></p><p> Wait long enough and they&rsquo;ll step in something fresh and sticky&mdash;coming from a cattle ranch, I could smell it a mile away.</p><p> Stereotypes are one of those ugly phrases that are freighted with negative connotations. But unconsciously, we make excuses for ourselves that are based on nothing more than stereotypes we&rsquo;ve cultivated about ourselves.</p><p> For example, whenever we adopt a self-limiting belief, we&rsquo;ve placed ourselves into a &ldquo;category&rdquo; and often refuse to move beyond it.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Get The Real Scoop On Women&rsquo;s Intuition </strong></h3><p> <br/> As a female, I&rsquo;ve always wondered whether such a thing as &ldquo;women&rsquo;s intuition&rdquo; really exists. More than once I&rsquo;ve been told that I have this particular feminine gift but I never knew how to respond&mdash;because although it was meant as a compliment, it always rang a little false.</p><p> A few years back,  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ickes\" target=\"_blank\">   Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas, William Ickes  </a> </u> , began a series of mind reading studies. He expected to find that women leaders would be more intuitive in understanding other people&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings. Ickes and his team were surprised, however, to find no difference between the men and women they tested.</p><p> Just as they were thinking of throwing &ldquo;women&rsquo;s intuition&rdquo; into the myth pile, they did three studies in a row where women leaders scored significantly higher than the men. This left Ickes scratching his head so they went back and took a closer look at what had changed.</p><p> As it turns out, in the last three studies the research team had started the study by stating that women, according to the women&rsquo;s intuition stereotype, would excel.</p><p> <strong>  Once the women leaders understood they would be rated on their intuition, they tried harder to live up to that stereotype, and this is the thing&mdash;they did perform higher than the men. </strong></p><p> Studies like those conducted by Ickes and his team suggest that it&rsquo;s not that men are poor mind readers, they&rsquo;re just unmotivated ones. Women, on the other hand, are motivated by the positive stereotype of women&rsquo;s intuition. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy!</p><h3> <strong>  3. Let Go Of What Happened In The Past </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The only time you need to look back is to see how far you&rsquo;ve come. </strong></p><p> Recognize that your recollection of the past is not always accurate; our memories are fallible. </p><p> Our memory does not store information exactly as it&rsquo;s presented to us. Instead, we extract the gist of the experience and store it in ways that makes the most sense to us. That&rsquo;s why different people witnessing the same event often have different versions.</p><p> Learn from past mistakes&mdash;turn your ghosts into ancestors that make you who you are today!</p><h3> <strong>  4. There Is No Such Thing As &ldquo;Too Late&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> It is never too late to become the person you were meant to be, and live the life you were meant to live.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re not on the right course, change course&mdash;the sooner, the better. There is no age limit on starting anew, and settling for a life that is mediocre is a tragic end to the only story your life will ever tell.</p><p> <strong>  Successful women leaders reinvent themselves regularly as new opportunities pop up and they set new goals for themselves. They have the initiative to try new things, even scary ones, rather than remain in a rut that looks more and more like a coffin everyday. </strong></p><p> Live a life you are proud of by finding the courage to make the changes you need to make.</p><p> I have always believed that people&mdash;both women and men&mdash;can achieve what they desire if they are motivated. There is a new generation of women leaders in the workplace who are more confident than the women who came before them. They&rsquo;ve been told they can accomplish anything they put their mind to.</p><p> <strong>  That&rsquo;s a stereotype I can live with. </strong></p><p> Men and women leaders&mdash;what stereotypes have you busted through to get where you are?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-21 15:07:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-21 15:07:05.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_XH1Eqct.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/bullst-excuses-holding-women-leaders-back/\", \"post_id\": \"9348\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-21 15:07:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-21 15:07:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"bullst-excuses-holding-women-leaders-back\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9347\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4469\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bullst-Excuses-Holding-Women-Leaders-Back.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"513\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456138800,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4305,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Women & Retirement: Overcoming the Emotional Side of Money","link":"women-retirement-overcoming-the-emotional-side-of-money","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently I was having lunch with a girlfriend who at one point confided that she let her husband handle all the finances, because dealing with money scares her. Ironically, I&rsquo;ve had many clients who at one point felt the same way.</p><h3> Money can be an uncomfortable topic for women, because for them, money is emotional.</h3><p> <br/> The topic usually triggers negative emotions, because they represent what we money coaches call a &ldquo;money blind spot&rdquo; or a limiting belief.</p><h3> The four most common negative emotions around money are guilt, shame, resentment and fear.</h3><p> <br/> Guilt around money represents judgement. The question I like to ask women is, &ldquo;What if judging yourself were no longer acceptable to you?&rdquo; When the client replaces self-condemnation with self-acceptance, she becomes open to forgiving herself, which in turn, increases her self-confidence with money. This is an essential step to financial empowerment. Guilt can keep women from having money. For instance, there are women who make a six-figure income but then spend it all, because they believe they don&rsquo;t deserve abundance.</p><p> Shame commonly shows up when debt is present, which interestingly so, I find more common with single women. Shame is an emotion that causes a woman to really question her self-worth. It is usually accompanied by berating and self-condemnation. There is usually some type of story the client is telling herself and perhaps reliving over and over in her mind, reminding herself of her short-comings and unworthiness, which, for her, the debt represents.</p><p> Resentment is common for women who have nurturing personalities. Feelings of resentment surface when they take care of other people in their life financially but neglect their own financial wellbeing. Women may find themselves paying for things for other people out of a feeling of obligation or in an attempt to please. There is usually an issue with a lack of boundaries, especially around money and self-care. These women tend to put other people&rsquo;s needs ahead of their own. For them, creating healthy boundaries around money is particularly important, as is the deeper exploration of why they feel compelled to take care of others by giving them money or paying for things when really they should be taking care of themselves financially. It would also behoove these women to explore areas in their lives where they might need to implement more self-care.</p><h3> Fear and worrying about money is quite common for women when they avoid dealing with their money.</h3><p> <br/> Fear of the unknown tends to cause excessive anxiety. They worry about not being able to take care of themselves financially, and since financial security is important for women, this is a big deal.</p><p> One irrational fear that women face is referred to as the Bag Lady Syndrome. According the AllianzWomen, Money &amp; Power study, forty-nine percent of women fear ending up broke and homeless regardless of their current income level. Among the women surveyed, a third of the highest income earners (those earning $200,000 and more) couldn&rsquo;t shake this fear. The study states that &ldquo;the pervasiveness of this worry may point to a deep-set financial insecurity that seems to be particular to women.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  In addition to the four emotions explained above, there are a host of other negative emotions that can get triggered for women around money, such as: </strong></p><li> Denial</li><li> Avoidance</li><li> Confusion</li><li> Anger</li><li> Resistance</li><li> Blame</li><li> Guilt</li><li> Complacency</li><li> Overwhelm</li><li> Sadness <br/>  </li><p> No one wants to feel uncomfortable or vulnerable, so if the topic of money triggers these emotions for women, they&rsquo;ll simply avoid it.</p><p> This mindset poses a big problem for women as they contemplate their retirement years, because it perpetuates those pesky bag lady fears.</p><p> For instance,</p><p> <strong>  53% of baby boomer women are concerned about outliving their sources of retirement income, and 28% of baby boomer women don&rsquo;t think they can afford to retire.&rdquo; </strong>  (The Allianz Reclaiming the Future Study, 2010)</p><p> Rather than tolerating negative emotions, women can take a stand for their financial security, vowing to take care of themselves instead of depending on someone else to do it for them.</p><h3> My best advice for women who fear the topic of money is to start where you are.</h3><p> <br/> Focus on increasing your financial literacy, and educate yourself on retirement planning. Make a plan to do everything you can to start saving more.</p><p> If the thought of taking charge of your finances feels overwhelming, go slow, take baby steps. But do get started now.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of thinking you need to wait until you make more money.</p><p> I have clients who manage to save money on annual salaries ranging from $40,000 to over six-figures.

{"original_id":4306,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Dumb Business Is Converting Only 1 in 10 Prospects …","link":"dumb-business-is-converting-only-1-in-10-prospects","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Remember when everyone starting in a sales role was told to just &ldquo;see the people, see the people, see the people!&rdquo;?</h3><p> <br/> Remember when the expectation was that our fame and fortune would be assured if we worked the 10-3-1 formula?  Call 10 people, and get appointments with 3 of them on average, and 1 would turn into a client?</p><p> For a few decades that worked well enough.  Consumers had limited information, and even more limited choices, and whether we realised it or not in financial services we were selling off the shelf solutions and making them fit clients needs.</p><p> The world just doesn&rsquo;t work that way anymore. Apart from the consumers themselves being more alert to the choices available, and also being far more focussed on finding solutions and strategies that are actually fit for purpose, that philosophy of &ldquo;eat what you kill&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t meet with the expectations of regulators or today&rsquo;s professionals.  Simply burning through a bunch of people in any given week and putting the hard word on them to buy something is a war of attrition.  Casualties are expected.  Lots of casualties.  90% in fact according to the old dogma.</p><h3> That is just dumb business.</h3><p> <br/> It is dumb because the overwhelming majority of interactions you have with the marketplace when you do business this way do not enhance your professional reputation.  They damage it.</p><p> It is dumb because the haste to make a sale of some sort to a consumer essentially is placing the advisers needs above the consumers.  That consumer typically has a genuine need or desire&hellip;but it just may not have manifested itself yet.  The timing or circumstances are possibly not quite right for them, even though what you do or have is going to be just what they need in time to come.</p><p> It is dumb because it is so inefficient.  It takes an enormous amount of time, money and effort to create an opportunity with a qualified prospect.  Throwing all of those resources away simply because the consumer wasn&rsquo;t ready to proceed today is extremely short-sighted and a poor commercial decision.</p><p> Mostly though it is dumb because the concept is fundamentally founded upon the idea of &ldquo;winning&rdquo;. Winning a sale.  Winning a client.  Winning the battle of wits&hellip;.define it however you like, but the antithesis is that for one to win, the other must lose.  There is no future in professional services for those who approach the market, and individual clients, with the mindset of &ldquo;I win, you lose&rdquo;.</p><h3> It is dumb.</h3><p> <br/> I know there are still plenty of advisers around that think and work this way.  Forgive them, they know no better.  In fact, thank them: they are making real professionals look fabulous.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s (and tomorrow&rsquo;s) financial professionals do not think or act like that of course.  But here is something that they also do not do:</p><h3> Put in place systems to nurture every opportunity that is identified.</h3><p> <br/> Professionals tend to be excellent at remembering people, and informally staying in contact, and being patient.  However they are also usually very busy and are trying to keep on top of a lot of details about a heck of a lot of people&hellip;.things slip through.  Too many months go by between contact with prospects.  The potentially ideal future client slips away because of the ad hoc approach to patiently building the relationship.</p><p> One of the other old catch phrases from back in the day that IS still relevant is: &ldquo;if you have a repeated problem, put a process in place&rdquo;.</p><p> So it is with patiently engaging with prospective future clients: put a process in place so nobody slips through the cracks.  Build a system to ensure that a consistent presence is created with the prospects while we wait for their circumstances to be right to proceed as clients.</p><p> Of course some will probably never actually progress into becoming clients for one reason or another, and of course some were ready to engage and proceed early on in the process.  The majority &ndash; perhaps 60% &ndash; will be sitting in the middle. Interested&hellip;.still learning and moving through the decision process&hellip;still establishing trust and confidence&hellip;..waiting for the catalyst event (such as the new home, new job, new family member) that is planned which will trigger the anticipated need for advice.</p><p> Putting in place a system of maintaining contact (without continually trying to sell products and services) that helps the prospect become more informed, build trust and familiarity, and demonstrates unequivocally that you are more interested in helping them than helping yourself leads to far higher conversion rates with prospects.</p><h3> Instead of burning through 9 prospects to get a client now, you are building a process where 8 out of 10 prospects become clients when it is right for them to do so.</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s smart business.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-21 15:23:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-21 15:23:02.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_mwTeTEg.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dumb-business-is-converting-only-1-in-10-prospects/\", \"post_id\": \"9352\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-21 15:23:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-21 15:23:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dumb-business-is-converting-only-1-in-10-prospects\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9351\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4471\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dumb-Business-Is-Converting-Only-1-in-10-Prospects-\\u2026.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"676\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456174800,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4309,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Importance of Leaning in With Clients","link":"the-importance-of-leaning-in-with-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As the daughter of a Chinese father and American-born mother, I have been exposed to many different stereotypes in the US, Europe, and Asia. I also grew up taking in mixed messages about what it means to be a successful, professional woman.</h3><p> <br/> While both my parents expressed their belief that I could achieve anything with hard work, focus, and dedication&mdash;I saw that professional women&rsquo;s struggles in Asia are exacerbated. As I grew older, I saw that women are not taken seriously professionally if they are too passive, but that they can also be derailed professionally by being seen as &ldquo;too ambitious,&rdquo; &ldquo;too expressive,&rdquo; &ldquo;too opinionated,&rdquo; or &ldquo;too individualistic.&rdquo;</p><h3> Finding a Way to Lean in That Felt Right to Me</h3><p> <br/> While I firmly believe that women can &ldquo;have it all,&rdquo; and that they should consistently &ldquo;lean in,&rdquo; my experience gives me a slightly different perspective&mdash;one that I bring to my career as a financial planner.</p><p> Indeed, juggling my responsibilities as a daughter, wife, mother, caregiver, professional, and professional financial planner has taught me to strive for balance&mdash;not perfection.</p><p> When I started out in financial planning, it was rare for a recruited female to be successful with a toddler and an infant, not to mention one from a diverse background. I knew, and so did everyone else, that the odds were against me. But with my success, 14 years later, that perceived liability is now an asset and a source of inspiration to other young women professionals in the financial planning field.</p><p> In my professional experience, I have always valued a collaborative approach involving negotiation, mediation, and compromise rather than an autocratic approach to resolving disagreements and conflicts. Being &ldquo;helpful,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a good listener,&rdquo; or &ldquo;valuing connections with clients&rdquo; may be dismissed as &ldquo;female&rdquo; traits, but make no mistake. They do not mask weakness. In fact, I have had to stand up against the criticism of some male managers for my professional approach with clients&mdash;which puts a premium on client service&mdash;because they view it as too time-intensive.</p><p> And to be honest, the comments of those who doubted me were responsible in part for motivating me to persevere. When I lean in, I am not just leaning in for myself. We all need to do our part to break through the stereotypes.</p><p> Though men hold a disproportionate share of corporate leadership positions, &ldquo;Many industries lack the inclusion and participation of people of color and women, perhaps none more egregiously than the financial services sector,&rdquo; said U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), in a statement.</p><p> The key for me is to lean in&mdash;on behalf of my clients and the financial planning industry. With my clients, I work to help them achieve balance between their financial-related goals for their lives now and their hopes for secure financial futures. With what the  <u>  National Journal </u>  says &ldquo;may be the most chauvinistic industry in America: Wall Street,&rdquo; <strong>  I work to clear the career path for other women and people with diverse cultural heritages. </strong></p><h3> Here is how I am leaning in with my clients:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  I strive to create a safe, comfortable zone for honesty and creative thinking. </strong>  I pride myself on my ability to sense stress, shame, or guilt as my clients enter my office. I recognize that their time is valuable and that they are coming to me to for financial guidance. I find that women, especially, need their advisors to be able to connect with them.</p><li> They also need to know that they are heard and understood, as opposed to being lectured to or talked down to. Women want someone to work with them to understand the impact that one decision may have on other areas of their financial lives. My goal is to enable women to verbalize the dreams they have for their personal financial journey and vocalize their individual needs and concerns so they are empowered to take ownership of their financial futures. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  I give my clients plenty of time to make sound financial decisions. </strong>  Many women are often struggling to balance their careers with their family responsibilities. It isn&rsquo;t so much that women procrastinate financial planning, but that they feel overwhelmed, overextended, and overworked.

Minimum wages are also going up in many states.</p><h3> It gets even better, based on an analysis by the American Institute of Economic Research (AIER) in western Massachusetts.</h3><p> <br/> An inflation measure designed by AIER that it calls the everyday price index, or EPI, actually declined last year. As its name implies, the EPI gauges changes in prices for things that are necessary for daily living, such as utilities and groceries, and excludes infrequent big-ticket items such as cars, homes, appliances, and even clothing. For this reason, it also weights gasoline more heavily than the standard consumer price index (CPI). The EPI declined 1.4 percent for the 12-month period ending in November, the latest data available, compared with the 0.7 percent increase for the CPI.</p><p> This gives workers a little  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/the-common-struggles-of-working-people/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   breathing room  </a> </u>  after years of wage stagnation and growing inequality. The historically low inflation that makes our paychecks go farther is being subdued by a combination of plummeting gasoline prices and a strong U.S. dollar, which reduces the prices for goods made overseas and purchased by Americans. For example, television prices didn&rsquo;t increase at all last year, according to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.aier.org/research/average-american%E2%80%99s-cost-living-falls\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AIER  </a> </u> .</p><p> Not all consumers benefit from low inflation, however. AIER calculates a special EPI for urban renters. This rose 2.1 percent, because they buy a basket of goods, such as city rents, that are going up in price. The EPI also puts a lot of weight on restaurant meals, which are getting more expensive.</p><p> Retired couples&rsquo; EPI increased 0.3 percent, in contrast to the overall EPI&rsquo;s decline.

{"original_id":4312,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Real Rate of Return","link":"the-real-rate-of-return","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Is there anything more important than the overall rate of return you earn on your investment portfolio? Yes, there is. It&rsquo;s the real rate of return.</h3><p> <br/> Over the past five years, even diversified portfolios have earned relatively low returns. Many investors are fearful that this has significantly reduced the income they can expect to receive upon retirement.</p><p> To see whether that fear is justified, let&rsquo;s look at some numbers. Based on a model portfolio I follow that holds nine different asset classes, the average return for the past three years (after all fees and expenses) was 2.45%. The five-year return was a little better at 2.67%. However, the seven-year return was 5.62%.</p><p> If an expected long-term (10 years or more) overall return on the same portfolio was 5.00%, at first glance it appears the portfolio slightly exceeded its expectation for seven years, but fell considerably short the last three and five years.</p><p> But if there is a first glance, you know there is a second glance coming. And that second glance highlights a seemingly obscure fact that changes the picture considerably. In every future return expectation, there is also another estimate that rarely is mentioned, but which is as important as the rate of return. This is the rate of inflation.</p><p> While the long-term expected overall return was 5.00%, the long-term expected rate of inflation was 3.00%. That means there was an expectation the investments would earn 2.00% above the rate of inflation. This is known as the real rate of return (ROR) and it&rsquo;s far more important than the overall rate of return. For example, if the projected inflation rate was 4%, the expected real rate of return would have been 1%. At a projected inflation rate of 6%, the real rate of return would have actually been negative.</p><h3> Most financial planners base their projections of a client&rsquo;s retirement income on the real rate of return. A real rate of return of 2% is very common.</h3><p> <br/> Taking into account the real rate of return, what has actually happened over the past three, five, and seven years? Overall expected returns have definitely been lower over the past three and five years. So has the rate of inflation. While the estimated inflation rate was 3.00%, the actual inflation rate was significantly lower, at 0.78% for the past three years and 1.03% for the past five. Subtracting these numbers from the overall rate of return (2.45% for three years and 2.67 for five years) gives us the real rates of return: 1.68% and 1.64% for the last three and five years. Compared with the estimated real return of 2.00%, this is slightly lower but still close to hitting the target.</p><p> Looking at the seven-year real rate of return, things go from &ldquo;ok&rdquo; to &ldquo;phenomenal.&rdquo; While the overall rate of return of 5.62% was higher than the expected return of 5.00%, the inflation rate was 1.03% instead of the expected 3.00%. This resulted in a real rate of return of 4.59%, more than double the expected real rate of return.</p><p> The bottom line is that those investors who have been in the market for seven years will have more to spend in retirement than previously projected. <strong>  In investment circles, this is called a home run. </strong></p><p> For investors discouraged by recent overall return numbers, a second look might give you cause to cheer up. If you&rsquo;ve invested in a diversified portfolio, rebalanced, and stayed the course during market crashes, things may be better than they seem.

{"original_id":4314,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"One Thing Top-Performing Sales Reps Understand … That You Don't","link":"one-thing-top-performing-sales-reps-understand-that-you-dont","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackKosakowski1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jack Kosakowski  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.creationagency.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Creation Agency  </u> </a></p><h3> In my sales career I&rsquo;ve always analyzed everything that happens on the sales floor.  </h3><p> <br/> The one common denominator that I always find, as it relates to top sales reps, is that they are always in conversation.</p><p> <strong>  When I was new to sales I would always try to figure out how the top reps were constantly in conversation.  I never saw them prospecting or begging for business like everyone else.  What were they doing that everyone else wasn&rsquo;t? </strong></p><h3> Conversations Light Up Revenue</h3><p> <br/> Top performing reps  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jackkosakowski.com/week-1-social-selling-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   always find a way to be in a conversation  </a> </u> .  I&rsquo;m not talking about a &ldquo;sales&rdquo; conversation&hellip;  I&rsquo;m just talking about conversation.  See, top sales reps understand the value of not talking about their product all the time because that is not their job.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jackkosakowski.com/socialselling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top performing sales are tightly focused  </a> </u>  on adding value at all levels,  and the &ldquo;sales&rdquo; conversation happens strategically only when there is a business problem to solve, and the timing is right.  The other conversations are built to strengthen the relationship, often before the buyer even knows they have the business problem.</p><h3> Taking Advantage of All Channels</h3><p> <br/> You hear the argument about  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jackkosakowski.com/socialselling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social selling vs traditional selling  </a> </u>  all the time in today&rsquo;s thought leadership.  Top reps don&rsquo;t think social or traditional when it comes to conversation.  They know that they need to be hitting all channels at all times to create more conversations.  Top reps will be talking on the phone, tweeting, and sending an email &ndash; all at one time.   <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jackkosakowski.com/hello-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   They leverage tools and technologies  </a> </u>  to their advantage for one simple reason: To find ways to add value in multiplicity because they understand that this leads to more conversations.</p><h3> They Think Conversation&mdash;Not Sale</h3><p> <br/> Top sales reps are tightly focused on value before ask.  You don&rsquo;t see top sales reps not taking calls because someone reached out to them with a question but wasn&rsquo;t a target buyer.  They will add value in every way they can because they know that leads to a conversation.  They don&rsquo;t think about title, company, or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;  They think about the opportunity for another conversation as another way to add value and create more energy.</p><h3> Right Conversation Leads To Revenue</h3><p> <br/> Top sales reps don&rsquo;t think about the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jackkosakowski.com/disruptyourselfishmindset/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   outcome of revenue when they have a conversation  </a> </u> .  They think about the conversation as a natural way to help the customer to a buying decision whether that is talking about the product or not.  Top sales reps are programmed to know that if they have conversations and add enough value on all levels &hellip; the revenue will follow over time.</p><h3> Conversations Drive Organic Referrals</h3><p> <br/> Top sales reps understand that  <u>  conversations drive organic referrals </u> .  It&rsquo;s in their nature to reach out to their current customers out of the blue just to have a conversation.  They understand that reaching out to other sales reps and having a conversation adds value.</p><h3> In Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> The world of sales has gotten very competitive for most industries.  There are more niches, more companies, and more sales reps than ever before.  Your sales manager is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jackkosakowski.com/socialsellinggamechanger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   giving you KPIs like dials, emails, or whatever FUGAZZI  </a> </u>  they have come up with that they expect from you.  I say&hellip; forget about all of that.  If you want to be the top sales rep then you need to be focused on one thing and one thing only&hellip; More CONVERSATIONS! Set your own  KPI, and consumer yourself with it.</p><p> Jack&rsquo;s post  <u>  appeared originally </u>  on LinkedIn.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-21 17:39:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-21 17:39:01.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_DyXiN3d.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/one-thing-top-performing-sales-reps-understand-that-you-dont/\", \"post_id\": \"9371\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-21 17:39:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-21 17:39:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"one-thing-top-performing-sales-reps-understand-that-you-dont\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9370\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4480\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/One-Thing-Top-Performing-Sales-Reps-Understand-\\u2026-That-You-Don\\u2019t.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"539\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456134300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4315,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Charitable Donations: A Tax Deduction Primer","link":"charitable-donations-a-tax-deduction-primer","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Whether you are giving to a religious organization, for medical research to find a cure or to save the elephants, you need to remember certain guidelines if you expect to take a deduction on your tax return. You can make your donations in cash or by check, credit card or payroll deduction. <strong>  But where a donation is made&mdash;PROOF is required. </strong> The IRS is not going to take it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll excuse the expression&mdash;on faith that you dropped $10,000 into the collection box in cash. The burden of proof for every deduction falls to you, the taxpayer.</p><p> <strong>  Make sure the organization to which you are giving is a qualified charity. </strong> You can check the IRS website Check . They list most organizations that are eligible to receive deductible contributions. If you&rsquo;re giving to a religious or governmental organization, you&rsquo;re pretty safe in taking the write-off. </p><p> If you made a year-end gift on your credit card, you can take the deduction in the year you hit SEND&mdash;not when you paid the bill. The same holds true for checks mailed before the end of the year. As long as you mailed it before the turn of the year, the deduction is yours to take, regardless of when the charity received or cashed your check. For those always looking for the edge, mailing the check in the new year with a pre-dated check is liable to get you caught. If the charity receives the donation on February 10th and processes it, it is unreasonable to assume you mailed it before the deadline.</p><p> The deduction for charitable donations can only be taken on Schedule A of your 1040.  Which means if you cannot itemize deductions, there&rsquo;s no place to take the deduction. Instead, the Standard Deduction&mdash;for those who cannot itemize&mdash;is assumed to include a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; amount of charitable donations. So if you cannot itemize, you cannot take advantage of any further charitable deduction.</p><p> There are special rules when it comes to donations of property, including clothing or household items. The IRS website provides details for taxpayers who unload their old clothes, used sofas, cars, boats and other items. You must keep a receipt from the charity, date of the contribution and a detailed list of items donated and the fair market value of the property. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for taxpayers to get creative with the value of their 30 year old Gucci leather belt, but if your assessment crosses the threshold of reasonableness, expect to get called out.</p><p> If you wind up handing over your car or boat to an organization, the deduction is usually limited to the gross proceeds of the sale of that asset. So if you have a junker that might have a blue book value of $3,000, but it brings in only $500 in a sale by the charity, you can take only a $500 deduction. <strong>  Remember, written documentation is a must. </strong></p><p> <strong>  Gifts to charities of appreciated stock, artwork and other appreciated assets (building, land, etc.) can be pretty complicated. </strong> It&rsquo;s best to work these transactions through with a qualified CPA who can explain these rules before you leap in and sign over the family Renoir.</p><p> Helping others is always a good thing&mdash;the feeling of providing aid to great causes touches our humanity. Getting a deduction for your generosity is a sweetener that also gives back to the giver in a financial way&mdash; <strong>  just so long as you follow the rules. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 16:44:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 16:44:04.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_WSMVHD4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/charitable-donations-a-tax-deduction-primer/\", \"post_id\": \"9373\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 16:44:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 16:44:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"charitable-donations-a-tax-deduction-primer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9372\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4481\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Charitable-Donations-A-Tax-Deduction-Primer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"781\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456224300,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4316,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Understanding the 3 Stages That Advisors Go Through When Re-Evaluating Where They Are and Where They Want to Be","link":"understanding-the-3-stages-that-advisors-go-through-when-re-evaluating-where-they-are-and-where-they-want-to-be","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> While it&rsquo;s human nature to strive for &ldquo;perfection&rdquo;, one thing I&rsquo;ve learned: Perfection is nearly impossible to achieve when it comes to one&rsquo;s work.</h3><p> <br/> Certainly, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s right to hold out for that perfect scenario; however I find that those who are the most unyielding in their expectations are typically not that unhappy with where they are&mdash;and that&rsquo;s as it should be. But, there are others who have reached their pain threshold; they will typically loosen their grip on perfection, become more willing to be flexible in their requirements and to give on the things that aren&rsquo;t essential. The latter are driven by a motivation to move on to something &ldquo;better enough&rdquo;.</p><p> It stands to reason that directly proportional to the amount of pain one is feeling about his current situation is the willingness to &ldquo;soften the edges&rdquo; of what defines the best place for him and his business. The more frustration one feels, the more flexible he is willing to be about what the next opportunity must look like.</p><p> Many advisors express some level of unhappiness with their current firm, citing a variety of reasons&mdash;too much bureaucracy, a desire for more control, lack of support, and a change in culture typically top the lists. These folks long for the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; scenario, where each piece falls into place exactly the way they want, solving for everything that they perceive to be wrong with where they are now.</p><p> Aiming for perfection is noble and what propels many to greatness. But without clarity of purpose and priorities, and the willingness to compromise, you&rsquo;re likely to be lost in a land of indecision, waiting a long time for perfection rather than identifying what may simply be &ldquo;better enough&rdquo;.</p><h3> When an advisor starts to recognize the imperfections of his current job, three things happen: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  They spring into action. </strong>  Many begin looking for ways to improve their job, and when that doesn&rsquo;t work, they begin to evaluate the landscape, spinning their wheels, sorting through a dizzying array of options in an ever-changing landscape. They ask friends, they read headlines and hear about uber-sized payouts. Then they start thinking about the &ldquo;perfect deal&rdquo; that would make a move &ldquo;worthwhile&rdquo;.</li><li> <strong>  They settle in. </strong>  This stage can go two ways: Some advisors decide it isn&rsquo;t so bad where they are, and simply choose to stay put. This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing at all; it means that from a position of strength, they have compared where they&rsquo;re at against what&rsquo;s available elsewhere and decided that inaction is the best strategy for now. Yet many other advisors dwell in discontentment, operating under the mindset that since there is no opportunity that would grant them the PERFECT work life, they immobilize themselves, regardless of how miserable they seem to be, until&hellip;</li><li> <strong>  They hit their pain threshold. </strong>  This is when waiting for perfection is no longer an option, and the motivation to move is driving the mindset. Yet to set out with an endpoint in mind, you must have clarity, which means digging deep and identifying the &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; (the things you can&rsquo;t live without) and those demands that may ultimately be OK to leave on the table. <br/>  </li><p> Unfortunately, many people in an untenable situation get &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; at stage 2, choosing to do nothing, settling for a situation that they recognize can&rsquo;t be further from perfect. Staying &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; is a sad choice, in my opinion, but one that can be avoided by gaining some clarity.</p><h3> How clarity enables flexibility</h3><p> <br/> In order to define what matters most to you, I recommend making three lists that answer the following:</p><p> What are the things you want to change about your current work life?</p><p> How much are your frustrations impacting your life, work, clients, and overall business?</p><p> What would you hope to achieve by making a move?

{"original_id":4317,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Top 5 Symptoms of Depression and How You Can Beat It","link":"the-top-5-symptoms-of-depression-and-how-you-can-beat-it","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  The swift and sudden descent of depression, along with worry and fear that caught me totally unaware as burnout struck in May 1987, was a shattering experience. </strong> My optimism had turned to terror overnight. I was scared! With the hopes that I can help someone suffering from depression and show you how you can beat depression, I now share with you the top 5 symptoms of depression which hit me like a ton of bricks.</p><h3> 1. Fear, worry and anxiety</h3><p> Somehow we find reason to worry about all the things we can&rsquo;t change. The exciting challenges in our lives now appear to us as problems and potential failures. Our faith turns to fear and anxiety takes over our trust in God. We are overcome with feelings of hopelessness. There appears to be no end in sight to our suffering, no light at the end of the tunnel. To the patient, this sickness seems to be terminal.</p><h3> 2. Lack of Joy</h3><p> With depression came an immediate lack of joy or happiness. Forcing a smile required a great deal of effort. However, the forced smile served as a poor mask for the emotional pain written across my face. I would tend to cry involuntarily. Weeping and depression seem to go hand in hand. Weeping seems to be our means of releasing the pent-up emotions and feelings from our minds as depression sets in. When we are depressed, we will become irritated very easily. People we work with and the customers we serve see us as irritable, edgy and hard to get along with, instead of the loving, kind and considerate people they once knew.</p><h3> 3. Chronic Fatigue</h3><p> I would wake up tired and continued to feel tired all day long. I couldn&rsquo;t even enjoy my hobbies. It felt as though someone opened a tap and drained all the energy out of my body. Sleep seems to no longer re-vitalized me or re-stored my energy. My body felt as though it needed to be dragged around. It was as though my zeal and zest for life had disappeared.</p><h3> 4. Insomnia</h3><p> It is common when we are depressed to have difficulty falling asleep, although some of us oversleep and still wake up tired. Lying there and waiting for sleep to come as our mind speeds on can cause a great deal of anxiety in itself. Our body is resting, but our mind refuses to stop thinking and worrying. There are times we fall asleep only to awake a short time later in a cold sweat. Prescribed sedatives can be a real lifesaver without causing an addiction.</p><h3> 5. Physical Ailments</h3><p> Even though these ailments are sometimes imagined, I certainly experienced chest pains, headaches, respiratory problems and weakness. These were actually symptoms of the stress that caused my depression. Food lost its taste. My stomach felt like it was tied in a knot as my appetite for food disappeared. Some people, however, begin to overeat and totally neglect their diets. After all, when we were kids, our parents used to give us a treat or a snack to make us feel better if we were crying.</p><h3> <strong>  How to Beat Depression and Live Again </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Get up</h3><p> Depressed people tend to want to stay in bed. They toss and turn and the fact they can&rsquo;t sleep drives them crazy. I quickly learned that when I wake up, I need to get up.</p><h3> 2. Hydrate</h3><p> Drink plenty of water. The fact that you are depressed may just be a symptom of your dehydration.</p><h3> 3. Exercise</h3><p> Any bouncing movements such as jogging or bouncing on a trampoline as part of your exercise routine activate the pituitary glands in the back of your head and pump &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormones into your body.</p><h3> 4. Dress up</h3><p> Our clothes reveal a great deal about the kind of image we hold of ourselves. I&rsquo;ve seen people who obviously woke up depressed and showed up at work unshaven, or their hair a mess and their clothes looking like they had slept in them. Dressing up is good way to trick ourselves into feeling better.</p><h3> 5. Listen up</h3><p> Turn off the news and turn on a positive podcast. What we feed our minds comes in through our ears and eyes.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 16:52:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 16:52:00.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_66WkMt8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-top-5-symptoms-of-depression-and-how-you-can-beat-it/\", \"post_id\": \"9377\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 16:52:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 16:52:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-top-5-symptoms-of-depression-and-how-you-can-beat-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9376\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4483\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Top-5-Symptoms-of-Depression-and-How-You-Can-Beat-It.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1085\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456257600,"author_id":55,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4318,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Everything You Know About Employee Retention Is Wrong","link":"everything-you-know-about-employee-retention-is-wrong","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Turnover is a big deal. </strong> The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">   Bureau of Labor Statistics  </a> </u>  reported that in April of 2015, a massive 2.7 million employees quit their job. And that rate has been on the rise for the past 12 months. It&rsquo;s no surprise &mdash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183479/job-creation-index-edges-new-high-may.aspx?utm_source=Economy&amp;utm_medium=newsfeed&amp;utm_campaign=tiles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u>  says the job market has been experiencing great improvement since the bleak era of the Great Recession.</p><p> As more jobs are being created, employees will be tempted to seek better opportunities. So in order to hold on to your top workers, you&rsquo;ll need to start strengthening your retention strategies and find ways to improve the work environment. To kick things off for you, we&rsquo;re debunking nine myths about employee retention.</p><h3> 1. It&rsquo;s all about the money</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  There&rsquo;s a common misconception that employees leave for better pay &mdash; always. </strong> But when  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bamboohr.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Workplace-Deal-Breakers-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HR Bamboo  </a> </u>  picked apart the reasons why people left their jobs, it turned out that money only ranked third on the list.</p><p> Although our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/lt-2015-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Employee Engagement Report  </a> </u>  found that nearly one in four employees would quit for a 10% raise elsewhere, that eagerness to jump ship ties into the work environment. From dissatisfaction with the work culture to conflicts with coworkers, there are countless reasons why people choose to leave their job. But the fact of the matter is that it isn&rsquo;t always about money. So don&rsquo;t expect that you can keep your employees sticking around by fattening up their wallets.</p><h3> 2. Small businesses can&rsquo;t compete against larger, big-name organizations</h3><p>  </p><p> <br/> <strong>  It&rsquo;s the case of the underdog getting outshined by a celebrity. </strong> It&rsquo;s true that start-ups and smaller organizations don&rsquo;t always have the resources to offer perks and amenities that big shots like Google do. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s impossible to keep your employees from getting sucked up by bigger organizations.</p><p> A study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://technologyadvice.com/human-resources-software/blog/employee-retention-and-perks-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TechnologyAdvice  </a> </u>  listed the most desired perks from employees were:</p><li> <strong>  Flexible work schedule or ability to work remotely </strong></li><li> <strong>  Free gym membership </strong></li><li> <strong>  Free food or catered lunches </strong></li><li> <strong>  Casual dress code </strong></li><li> <strong>  Mentoring or developmental programs </strong> <br/>  </li><p> These are all perks that small organizations can implement for little to no money. In terms of free food or catered lunches, you don&rsquo;t have to do it every day. Even having food catered once a month or holding potlucks every other week are great perks any small business can offer.</p><h3> 3. You can keep employees around with high-profile awards</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  You know the deal: employee of the month, bonuses, and mugs. </strong> These will surely keep people loyal to your organization, right? Wrong. As much as these awards make sense to you, they don&rsquo;t to employees. Especially since  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/lt-2015-employee-engagement-organizational-culture-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our research  </a> </u>  found that not even one in three employees feels strongly valued on the job.</p><p> The longer an employee has to wait to get recognized for their contributions, the more they start to feel unvalued at work. And considering that only a handful of people get chosen for these awards, imagine how many people go without receiving any recognition. Employees want recognition now, not later. So even if it&rsquo;s just a pat on the back or a quick &ldquo;hey, great work on so-and-so project,&rdquo; these simple praises will do wonders for your employees' motivation.</p><h3> 4. Employees are easily replaceable</h3><p> <br/> When an employee leaves, you may think you can easily just hire on someone to fill that position. However, the cost of turnover isn&rsquo;t just about money spent on classified ads.  <u>  TalentWise </u>  discovered that when an employee leaves, they take about 70% of their knowledge with them. Not so replaceable anymore, huh?</p><h3> 5. Recruitment and retention aren&rsquo;t related</h3><p> <br/> Recruitment is when you look for candidates, then bring them on board. Retention is keeping them there. When put this way, it seems like they&rsquo;re two completely different entities. But the two are actually intertwined.</p><p> Retention starts when you&rsquo;re screening candidates. During the interview. When you offer someone the job. Before you even bring someone on board, you need to determine whether or not they&rsquo;ll fit into your company culture and if this is the right job fit for their career path. If you hire someone based solely on their skills, both parties might come to find that the newcomer just can&rsquo;t mesh well with their colleagues or doesn&rsquo;t enjoy the nature of the work.</p><h3> 6. You don&rsquo;t need to measure turnover</h3><p> <br/> Do numbers really matter for turnover? High or low, every company faces turnover, so you never have to worry about keeping track of how many people have left. If there&rsquo;s an actual problem within your organization, it&rsquo;ll be obvious.</p><p> Reality is, it&rsquo;s not always obvious. Whether you go from a 3% turnover rate to 30%, or the numbers just remain at 10%, the issue at hand is still that employees are leaving. You need to keep track of the ups and downs of your organization&rsquo;s turnover rate to establish a trend or get to the bottom of the issue. How will you know if you&rsquo;re actually improving your workplace or if it&rsquo;s regressing if you don&rsquo;t keep track of the numbers?</p><h3> 7. Low turnover means your employees love their jobs</h3><p> <br/> Low turnover rate making you say \"hooray\"? We say nay to that. There are typically two types of people who stay at their jobs: those who actually love it and those who stay out of sheer laziness. With the hours spent looking through job postings, writing cover letters, and going to interviews, it takes a lot of effort to find a new job. And some people don&rsquo;t have the motivation to do that, so they&rsquo;d rather stay unhappy at the job they already have.</p><p> And there&rsquo;s your problem. A disengaged employee isn&rsquo;t doing your bottom line any good. You don&rsquo;t want someone who just shows up to clock in and clock out. You want someone who will put in every single ounce of effort into their work. So leverage a tool like pulsing surveys to get down and dirty into employee sentiment. You might have thought your workplace was all rainbows and unicorns, but a pulsing survey is the ideal way for employees to air their dirty laundry.</p><h3> 8. The company is to blame when an employee leaves</h3><p> <br/> People are quitting. It must be the company&rsquo;s fault. The company culture isn&rsquo;t working. A process is broken. These are all assumptions that you can easily make when people quit, but the company isn&rsquo;t always to blame. Sometimes people love the company and the culture but loathe their boss.</p><p> Before promoting someone, first take into consideration how this person has recognized their peers. Do they do it often and inspire their coworkers? What about communication &mdash; do they provide clear information to their peers, or do they hoard it so they make their colleagues look bad? If they don&rsquo;t exemplify these qualities as an employee, there&rsquo;s a good chance they won&rsquo;t do so as a leader. Skills like project management can be learned, but personality can&rsquo;t.</p><h3> 9. You have no control over turnover</h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t stop people from leaving. It&rsquo;s the choice they made, and you have no influence over it ... is what a bad boss would say.</p><p> Leaders do have control over turnover. If they invest in their employee&rsquo;s development, ask for their feedback and act upon it, and frequently recognize good work, then you can bet people will be willing to stick around longer. Use a tool like pulsing surveys to stay on top of employee sentiment and nip issues right in the bud. If you solve issues before they become a nightmare, you can definitely prevent a number of employees from quitting.</p><p> Quitting is typically the last resort for employees. Once they&rsquo;ve reached their limit and see no improvements in the workplace, they&rsquo;re going straight for the door. So make sure you create a transparent environment that also fosters two-way communication. That way, both employees and leaders will be receptive to workplace issues and finding solutions to improve the culture.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 17:14:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 17:14:08.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_H9K5XL2.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/everything-you-know-about-employee-retention-is-wrong/\", \"post_id\": \"9379\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 17:14:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 17:14:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"everything-you-know-about-employee-retention-is-wrong\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9378\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4484\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Everything-You-Know-About-Employee-Retention-Is-Wrong.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"527\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456236000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4319,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Storytelling to Inspire Business Success","link":"storytelling-to-inspire-business-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Ten years ago, in 2005, a group of people working in the field of knowledge management across the UK and the USA coined the phrase \"narrative leadership.\"  </strong> So was born what might appear to be another fad in the field of leadership. Plenty of books were written and conferences attended. <br/> <br/> But once the dust had settled and HBR et al were talking about other topics, positive progress had been made. More CEOs made use of stories to communicate compelling visions. More innovative businesses brought together multidisciplinary teams to share knowledge through storytelling. One of the leading lights of this movement was a consultant by the name of  <a href=\"http://www.stevedenning.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Stephen Denning </a> . <br/> <br/> <strong>  Now, a decade later - amid the buzz about big data, decision science, content marketing, and disruption- you don&rsquo;t hear many people talk about narrative leadership. </strong> But a focus on storytelling is reawakening. In the early 2000s, I had the pleasure of experiencing a leadership training course that included material from Stephen, and I was captivated. The concept that humans are innately receptive to the telling of stories as a means of effective communication was self-evident around the world and in so many different cultures. It was also captivating to imagine how the dull world of working in Financial Services could be enlivened by this more holistic style of leadership. <br/> <br/> The book I recommend you read on this topic is &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Leaders-Guide-Storytelling-Mastering-Discipline/dp/078797675X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Leader's Guide to Storytelling  </a> </u> &ldquo; by Stephen Denning. Its subtitle gives a clue to the style of this tome: &ldquo;Mastering the art and discipline of business narrative.&rdquo; Whilst not always an easy read, partly due to the depth of what is shared and partly to the polymath nature of the author, it is a treasury of practical advice on this challenge. It's one of those books I&rsquo;ve returned to several times over the years to refine my skills and to pass on storytelling tips to customer insight analysts and leaders alike. <br/> <br/> <strong>  It is structured into three primary sections:  </strong> part one explains the role of story within organisations; part two unpacks eight narrative patterns (story templates) that help with different leadership challenges; and part three covers what Stephen calls &lsquo;putting it all together&rsquo; or the challenge of how to apply this approach. <br/> <br/> After the encouragement of the first two chapters, to be sure you are telling the right story (true, relevant, and helpful) and telling the story right (the performance piece), the treasure chest of this book is the eight chapters that form Part Two. Using a mixture of evocative analogies and real world examples (including surprisingly short and simple stories),</p><h3> Stephen shares templates for stories and approaches to creating them for eight different common leadership challenges: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Motivating Others to Action: </strong> A positive &lsquo;springboard&rsquo; story;</li><li> <strong>  Building Trust in You: </strong> A turning point story;</li><li> <strong>  Building Trust in Your Company: </strong> A brand promise in action story;</li><li> <strong>  Transmitting Your Values: </strong> A minimalist parable;</li><li> <strong>  Getting Others Working Together: </strong> A moving account of shared experience;</li><li> <strong>  Sharing Knowledge: </strong> Problem solving stories with context;</li><li> <strong>  Taming the Grapevine: </strong> Satirising the rumour mill;</li><li> <strong>  Creating and Sharing Your Vision: </strong> A future story. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  In each of these chapters </strong> , Stephen digs beneath the surface of the challenge to help leaders understand which approaches work and which do not, plus the reasons for such behaviour. He compliments this with real life examples, practitioner tips, and a template for taking the storytelling approach recommended. In that sense, this is much more than a book about storytelling; it is just as much a leadership textbook. However, true to its raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre, it delivers bite-sized leadership advice through the medium of stories and examples. <br/> <br/> Although it might sound like the most-relevant chapter for Customer Insight leaders is Chapter 6 above, Sharing Knowledge, in fact all the leadership challenges above appear at different times for insight leaders and their teams. That knowledge sharing chapter is also more focused on how to convey in a more interesting way rather dry technical expert knowledge learned through experience. The most relevant of all the stories to insight leaders and the one Stephen suggests leaders master first is, in fact, the first one. Communicating insights in a positive way that motivates action in the business is perhaps their greatest challenge and one where a well-crafted story can really help. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Which brings us to the closing part of this book. </strong> Across two chapters, one focused on the challenge of how established businesses can innovate and the other on a \"different kind of leader,\" Stephen passes on a great deal of leadership wisdom. The final chapter on being a different kind of leader is particularly inspirational and draws together numerous strands from throughout this book (our story). He advocates an interactive leadership model, one where the leader participates, connects, andcommunicates with different types people as peers; open to fresh ideas. If you exclude the manipulative models of leadership (from corrupt bureaucrats to spin doctors), he suggests twoauthentic models of leadership: the first is the traditional command and control, or Napoleonic model, of leadership; the second is an interactive model using narrative and genuine conversations or Tolstoyan leadership.</p><h3> Despite being 10 years old, this book is a real gem.</h3><p> <br/> In today&rsquo;s business world, with the challenges of content marketing, customer conversations, colleague motivation, and continual innovation &ndash; Stephen&rsquo;s advice sounds more relevant than ever.

However, many people fail to realize that they need to change who they are in order to do the right things and get what they want.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why mindset is so important. You need to &ldquo;be&rdquo; the right person before you can &ldquo;do&rdquo; the right things that will allow you to eventually &ldquo;have&rdquo; what you want.</p><h3> Creating a successful minset</h3><p> <br/> Everyone wants to be successful in whatever they do. I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who starts their day by saying, &ldquo;How can I fail today?&rdquo; Unfortunately, far too many start the day without asking,&ldquo;How can I be successful today?&rdquo;</p><p> More importantly, many of us start the day with the wrong mindset; they start out daily with a mindset that goes contrary to being a success. They go through the motions and in many cases, let the day&rsquo;s events take control of them. Then, they do it all over again the very next day.</p><p> Wanting, wishing or hoping to be successful isn&rsquo;t enough. To be a success, requires a &ldquo;certain&rdquo; mindset that results in your ability to take the &ldquo;right&rdquo; actions. Here are 5 ways to help you create your own success mindset:</p><li> <strong>  Successful people see problems as opportunities in disguise. </strong> They face them with a smile, focus and grit.</li><li> <strong>  Successful people just don&rsquo;t willingly confront problems: they solve them. </strong> Not always by themselves, because they are not afraid to ask for help from others when needed. One more thing: not only do they solve their own problems, but they also see it as their role to help others solve their problems.</li><li> <strong>  Successful people see, understand and evaluate risk. </strong> They accept that &ldquo;risk&rdquo; comes with the territory. They manage risk so that it doesn&rsquo;t turn into fear. They also do not let risk deter them from doing what they know is the right thing to do. They understand that &ldquo;playing it safe&rdquo; will derail them.</li><li> <strong>  Successful people are full time &ldquo;learners&rdquo;. </strong> They know that learning and enhancing their skills is what gives them a permanent competitive edge over others and the many challenges (problems) they deal with. They learn from most everything they do, including mistakes. In fact, they see mistakes as offering the best opportunities to learn.</li><li> <strong>  Successful people consistently deliver value in whatever they do for whomever they do it for. </strong> At the end of the day, they know that personal success can only be measured by the value you deliver to others. <br/>  </li><p> Wait a minute? I just realized that there is one more characteristic people with a success mindset have &ndash; it&rsquo;s a sense of humor. They have fun and want to share it with others. Plus, they know how to laugh at themselves.</p><p>  </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 17:29:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 17:29:07.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_kXWTwTY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/success-its-all-in-your-mindset/\", \"post_id\": \"9383\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 17:29:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 17:29:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"success-its-all-in-your-mindset\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9382\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4486\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Success-It\\u2019s-All-in-Your-Mindset.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"871\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456257600,"author_id":109,"chart_url":""}

What&rsquo;s interesting here is the idea of &ldquo;two-dimensional diversity.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t enough to simply hire employees of different races, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. Inclusive leaders need to listen to the ideas that these different backgrounds bring to the table. Being diverse, and being inclusive, are not the same things.</p><p> <strong>  Hewlett recommends business leaders create a &ldquo;speak-up culture,&rdquo; </strong> which essentially means to create a workplace that values diverse ideas, and that is a place where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas and opinions. This seems like common sense, but when a leader is juggling the tasks of maintaining an inclusive culture along with day-to-day responsibilities, it&rsquo;s difficult to carve out the time to evaluate whether the current culture is working or not.</p><p> Thankfully, Hewlett has compiled a list of six behaviors that the best inclusive leaders (and aspiring inclusive leaders!) can do that are pretty simple, not overly time consuming, and best of all, that can lead to an inclusive, speak-up culture:</p><li> <strong>  Asking questions and listening to your team&rsquo;s answers </strong></li><li> <strong>  Facilitating helpful arguments </strong></li><li> <strong>  Providing good, useful feedback </strong></li><li> <strong>  Actually acting on advice </strong></li><li> <strong>  Sharing credit with your team </strong></li><li> <strong>  Always staying connected with employees </strong> <br/>  </li><p> By practicing these six behaviors, inclusive leaders can work against their unconscious biases and listen to everyone in the company, regardless of their differences or varying backgrounds. Encourage your employees to share their ideas to create a speak-up culture today.</p><p> Be inclusive!</p>","channel":8,"channel_url":8,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 17:37:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 17:37:33.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_6gVacAC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/behaving-like-an-inclusive-leader-create-a-speak-up-culture/\", \"post_id\": \"9385\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 17:37:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 17:37:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"behaving-like-an-inclusive-leader-create-a-speak-up-culture\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9384\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4487\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Behaving-Like-an-Inclusive-Leader-\\u2014-Create-a-\\u201cSpeak-Up\\u201d-Culture.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"831\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456250400,"author_id":442,"chart_url":""}

Here's my attempt. </strong>  I'm working with a new coaching client who has an ambitious goal: To start his own business this year. When he learned that my firm was about to celebrate 13 years, he asked me the secret to its success, but with a caveat: He wanted a one-word answer.</p><h3> Uff-da.</h3><p> <br/> A former over-thinker (I like to think I've moved past that phase...most days, anyway!), I shared the first word that came to mind. And upon further thought, I stand by this word:</p><h3> Believe.</h3><p> <br/> I could easily list 500 lessons I've learned over the years, most of which I wish I'd learned sooner. Things like knowing your target market, investing in resources (even before you feel you can afford them), choosing marketing strategies, hiring excellent support. While all beneficial, they aren't going to do much if you don't first believe.</p><p> Far be it from me to try and tell you what you should believe. But here I go anyway:  </p><h3> Believe in your service. </h3><p> <br/> So many of my clients struggle with selling, or with charging what they're worth. Whether you're selling a product to a potential client or your skills to a potential employer, to fully step into your worth, you need to believe wholeheartedly in the service, product, or task you're performing. If you knew the cure for a life-threatening disease and met someone with that disease, would you hold back because you didn't want to seem pushy or sales-y? No, you would believe so much in your ability to enhance their lives that you would share far and wide. What aspect of your work do you need to believe in more?</p><h3> Believe in your purpose. </h3><p> <br/> Often, we approach the topic of purpose as if it has a huge, overwhelming capital P. Your purpose can be found in your passions, in your dreams, in the exciting ideas that just won't leave you alone no matter how hard you try to push them out of your mind. There's no question you are living your purpose; the question is, are you doing it with intention? To what extent? How do you believe you're bringing purpose to your work and life every day?</p><h3> Believe in good. </h3><p> <br/> What you believe will essentially form your experience. If your belief is \"Life is awful,\" you will find plenty of evidence to support that; likewise, if you decide to believe that life is a beautiful gift, you will find the evidence to support that. You get to choose, folks! And trust me, one choice sparks a lot more joy than the other.</p><h3> Most importantly, believe in you. </h3><p> <br/> I floundered here for ages and, to be honest, I still have my moments. It helps when you hear people say, \"My work / life is better because of you.\" But you know what? You have to believe in that whether or not you get the verbal or written affirmation. And that requires trust.</p><h3> Let me give you an example.</h3><p> <br/> This week in the  <a href=\"http://meaning-and-purpose.com/ASPIRESuccessClub.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ASPIRE Success Club </a> , we talked about anonymous acts of kindness. You're at the drive-through at Starbucks, for example, and you decide to pay for the person in line behind you. You drive off, never knowing what impact your purchase made.</p><h3> But you trust that you just made that person's day.</h3><p> <br/> And, since they likely \"paid it forward,\" you also made some other people's day.</p><p> And also consider the Starbucks employee, who is so moved by your generosity and the string of pay-it-forwarders that follow your lead. <strong>  You've made his day. </strong></p><p> And maybe he then treats the in-store customers a bit more beautifully. <strong>  Your act has made their day, and then they go out and pay it forward... </strong></p><p> The ripple effect is far-reaching and widely impactful. And here maybe you thought you were just treating someone to a free coffee!</p><p> Much of the past 13 years, for me and MAP Inc., has been an exercise in belief. When I am strong in my belief, I see the results. When I waver and waffle, I see those results too - and they're not nearly as fun.</p><h3> So my one-word tip?

{"original_id":4324,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Invest in Turbulent Times? Quality May Be the Answer","link":"how-to-invest-in-turbulent-times-quality-may-be-the-answer","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> <strong>  HOW SHOULD THE QUALITY FACTOR BE DEFINED? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The concept of quality in many asset classes is not new, but its application to equity selection has gained traction in the last few years. Quality can help meet investment objectives as a single factor or in combination with other factors. Intuitively, it makes sense that high-quality companies should have better overall performance than low-quality companies. Unfortunately, however, unlike other equity factors such as value or size, there is no generally accepted definition of quality.</p><p> Often, the quality metric is simply related to some measure of profitability. Many asset managers include quality in a multi-metric definition, for example, combining return on equity,1 debt-toequity ratio2 and earnings variability.3 Or, as in the Russell U.S. Equities Indices, return on assets plus leverage plus earnings variability. Another variation is the F score, developed by Joseph Piotroski. It combines nine metrics, including net income, operating cash flow, return on assets, stability of earnings, leverage, liquidity issuance, gross margins and asset turnover. The issue is hotly debated and there are countless methodologies in the marketplace.</p><p> Interestingly, in its continuing research of the quality factor and how to apply it in a scoring methodology, FlexShares&rsquo; parent company, Northern Trust , concluded that &ldquo;quality&rdquo; includes those features of a company that particularly appeal to risk-averse investors. Further, their empirical evidence has shown that the higher returns of high-quality companies have, in fact, been associated with considerably lower levels of risk. If that seems counter-intuitive to the most widely used pricing model in finance&ndash;the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)4 &ndash; that&rsquo;s because it is.</p><p> CAPM assumes universal risk aversion on behalf of investors. That&rsquo;s not actually the case with human behavior. Investors are heterogeneous. The risk averse seek low-volatility stocks in search of &ldquo;peace of mind.&rdquo; As quality erodes, risk increases. High-volatility stocks are most attractive to risk-seeking investors, who bid up the price of these lower-quality equities and consequently reduce their returns. The result: high-quality stocks typically outperform low-quality names because lowquality/high-volatility names are relatively expensive versus high-quality/low-volatility names.</p><p> <strong>  Given the extremely volatile market environment, we cannot over-emphasize the importance of the quality factor in choosing equities that can survive and even thrive </strong></p><h3> <strong>  HOW DOES FLEXSHARES JUDGE QUALITY? </strong></h3><p> <br/> High-quality companies exhibit certain characteristics. The FlexShares quality scoring process includes detailed assessments of each company compared to its peers, using fundamental factors that are empirically tested, supported by academic research and applied quantitatively.</p><h3> Below are the pillars of our methodology. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Management efficiency: </strong> a quantitative evaluation of a firm&rsquo;s deployment of capital as well as its financing decisions. Research shows firms that aggressively pursue capital expenditures and additional financing lose flexibility in both advantageous and challenging portions of the market cycle.</li><li> <strong>  Profitability: </strong> a determination of a firm&rsquo;s relative competitive advantage across several different metrics. Firms with wider margins are better positioned to grow compared to firms with slimmer margins.</li><li> <strong>  Cash flow: </strong> an assessment of the liquidity levels of the company. A firm that cannot meet its debt obligations and day-to-day liquidity needs will be poorly positioned to take advantage of future opportunities or provide a financial cushion during periods of distress We apply this methodology to companies on a sector basis in order to:</li><li> <strong>  Provide an &ldquo;apples-to-apples&rdquo; comparison, since different sectors </strong> &mdash; such as utilities and technology companies &mdash; vary considerably in how they profile;</li><li> <strong>  Find quality companies in every sector without concentrating in certain pockets of the market </strong> ; and</li><li> <strong>  Prevent unintended stock selection and weighting biases caused by a dramatic sector drift from the starting universe. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The result is a growing body of ETF products that can appeal to risk-averse investors and may help them achieve stronger risk-adjusted returns through the most turbulent of market environments.</p><p> Eight of our 22 ETFs have the word &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; in their name.

I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder why I bother.&rdquo; Perhaps you&rsquo;ve felt that way too. It can be tough to stay motivated in a negative workplace.</p><p> &ldquo;Just think of any negativity that comes at you as a raindrop falling in the ocean of your bliss.&rdquo; -Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</p><h3> 10 Ways to Overcome Negativity at Work <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Make a list of what you like most about your job.  </strong> Share it with others. Ask them what they like most about their jobs.</li><li> <strong>  Ask people why they work. </strong>  In a negative environment, the answer may seem obvious&mdash;&ldquo;For the paycheck, stupid&rdquo;&mdash;but take it a step further. Do they work to support their sick mom? To pay back student loans? To save for their children&rsquo;s education? Because they enjoy helping customers? Reconnecting to the purpose of work can help make the smaller annoyances less frustrating.</li><li> <strong>  Call out negativity. </strong>  When you see negative thinking or actions, talk to the person privately to call it out, particularly if other leaders are involved. When negative attitudes and talk are all around, it&rsquo;s tempting to ignore it. Raise the bar and change the conversation.</li><li> <strong>  Rise above the drama.  </strong> Refuse to get sucked into the rumors and gossip. Respond to your team&rsquo;s concerns with transparency and candor. Be the one who people know they can trust for a straight answer.</li><li> <strong>  Find kindred spirits. </strong>  Not everyone is negative, although it can feel that way at times. Look around and find other folks trying to change the scene for the better. There is strength in numbers. Look outside your organization as well.</li><li> <strong>  Create an &ldquo;envelope of excellence&rdquo; or cultural oasis. </strong>  It&rsquo;s easy to feel overwhelmed trying to fix the overall culture. Start with your own team and do what you can to make it feel better to come to work.</li><li> <strong>  Find reasons to celebrate. </strong>  With all the negativity, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the good. Go out of your way to recognize and celebrate small wins. Substitute weak phrases like &ldquo;No problem&rdquo; with more enthusiastic words like &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  See barriers as a challenge. </strong>  Encourage your team to embrace the problems they see as opportunities and challenges to learn and grow. Recap learning along the way to help them feel a sense of positive momentum even during the most challenging times.</li><li> <strong>  Laugh more. </strong>  I had one colleague who would respond to the company&rsquo;s most ridiculous political nonsense by reminding the team, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all comedy.&rdquo; Step back and recognize how ridiculous some behavior is. You&rsquo;ll create a healthy distance from which to respond more appropriately.</li><li> <strong>  Hold deeper developmental conversations. </strong>  In periods of uncertainty, people yearn for a sense of control and connection. Take your developmental conversations to the next level. Ask your team and your peers about their hopes and dreams, what motivates them, and what scares them. Show up as a real human being caring about other real human beings. <br/>  </li><p> Don&rsquo;t let the naysayers win.

{"original_id":4326,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"RegTech Innovation: Securing Compliance In A Disruptive Market","link":"regtech-innovation-securing-compliance-in-a-disruptive-market","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Already in 2016 interest in RegTech has skyrocketed, placing it as a key strategic area for innovation for many technology solution providers.</h3><p> <br/> RegTech solutions have the potential to cure a number of headaches for financial services as it aids more efficient and effective compliance management. But more than just a cost saving, know your customer (KYC), financial inclusion and an enhanced customer experience are all driving forces behind the development of RegTech innovations. RegTech at its simplest is regulation technology. Technology to help organisations make better use of their resources, better manage data and integrate relevant regulations within their systems. The sheer quantity of data financial institutions now hold is staggering. Innovations that make better use of this data, whilst feeding into compliance reporting and risk management, stand to aid competitive advantage and should help to deliver increased profits. RegTech solutions are enabling organisations to look at compliance issues strategically, to find efficiencies and cost savings rather than tactical responses which makes compliance a drawn out process, placing a huge drain on resources.</p><h3> Rising further up the agenda with each passing month</h3><p> <br/> FinTech innovations are bringing new entrants into the financial services market. With disruptive technology changing the face of the market, regulation needs to adapt at a similar pace. This is creating a heavy burden on an industry that is already immensely regulated. Financial headlines are filled with news about RegTech companies growing in success. In the past week alone we have heard news of AQ Metrics, who provide a cloud-based platform to address regulatory risk and compliance, receiving $3.25 million in funding. Further, fresh from winning Central Banking Award 2016 in the category &ldquo;Technology Provider of the Year&rdquo; in January this year, BearingPoint, a regulatory software solutions consultancy, has been ranked in the 2016 Chartis RiskTech100. With ongoing interest and investment, it is clear to see RegTech is establishing itself as the poster child for technology innovation in 2016. Let's explore why, here are my top 5 picks.</p><h3> Maintaining the digital experience with online verification</h3><p> <br/> Increasingly consumers are going digital. Digitalization is nothing new but the ever increasing expectations of customers and their speedy acceptance of digital tools is. With mobile devices offering the same functionality as desktop computers, users expect to be able to complete all their tasks in a single process. If they need to prove who they are, they do not want to go back to finding paper copies of birth certificates and going through the hassle of getting them verified. We all want and expect in the modern age, a simple process of verifying their identity online. Today&rsquo;s customers are comfortable with the prospect of biometric forms of ID&amp;V to create accounts, which they then access and use on mobile devices.</p><h3> Inclusion for harder to reach customers</h3><p> <br/> Digital identities are able to mediate relationships and verify individuals. An estimated 2 million UK adults do not currently have access to financial services, which puts them at a disadvantage when looking for financial support, and can result in them paying a poverty premium of up to &pound;1,300 annually. The impact of enabling financial inclusion through better identification and reducing barriers to services would reap benefits for those who need them most. Digital verification also has the potential to offer life changing benefits for migrants coming to the UK who are able to prove their identity without paperwork. The government service GDS Verify helps people prove their identity online, in order to access government services such as viewing their driving licence or submitting a tax return. A similar system that enables online verification of previously excluded individuals would make access to finance homogeneous.</p><h3> Knowing every customer</h3><p> <br/> KYC has resulted in significant operational impacts within banks, who are now required to have \"good customer information across the board\". KYC changes how customers are identified, segmented and communicated with. Over 60% of respondents from the financial industry in a JWG survey carried out in 2014, considered compliance reporting to be under most pressure from &ldquo;Know Your Customer&rdquo; initiatives. Whilst the regulations have floated around for quite some time, the changes to laws are adding complication to the process of holding data and evidencing compliance.</p><h3> A niche to bring substantial financial gains</h3><p> <br/> It is recognised that RegTech has the potential to reduce the human resource required to maintain compliance, through the automation of low-value processes and enabling verified complex data to be accessed quickly and formatted to aid analysis. Solutions will be based on current standards but adaptable for future changes, easy to integrate with legacy systems, cost effective to adopt and dependable to avoid costly sanctions made for incomplete data exchanges. Data systems that deliver insights internally in addition to meeting compliance standards will top the shopping list.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s a two-way street &ndash; regulators are set to benefit too</h3><p> <br/> The quantity of data that the banks are gathering is of interest to regulators. Being able to access this data in a usable format will become increasingly important to them. APIs that ensure data can be delivered in a single format to create a holistic view of the market will be required. These APIs will need to facilitate the transfer of data across multiple legacy and cloud-based systems, without further imposing on these already heavily burdened organisations. </p><p> <strong>  Innovators in RegTech have the potential to bring organisations and regulators closer together. </strong> It is essential that regulators recognise the need to get to know their industries better. With FinTech providers sitting on the edges of the industry, regulators need to understand where responsibilities lie, making sure that any activity that requires compliance standards are captured within regulatory control. As the lines between technology firms and financial organisations blur, maintaining this control is of utmost importance. Only by working closely with the industry will they be able to manage this effectively.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 18:42:59.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 18:42:59.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_lWWeZQp.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/regtech-innovation-securing-compliance-in-a-disruptive-market/\", \"post_id\": \"9395\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 18:42:59\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 18:42:59\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"regtech-innovation-securing-compliance-in-a-disruptive-market\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9394\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4492\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/RegTech-Innovation-Securing-Compliance-In-A-Disruptive-Market.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"826\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456225200,"author_id":129,"chart_url":""}

Economics is hard. Not in a &ldquo;things are actually good today&rdquo; way. But in mid-2008 surging oil prices and a falling dollar were a big headwind.&rdquo; <strong>  As a Financial Advisor, I read every piece of economic data available to me and follow the thought processes of the top thinkers at virtually all the key financial institutions so I can carefully invest money on behalf of our clients. </strong> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve discovered: </strong> none of them, and none of us, have been given a roadmap to what the future holds. They can watch and study the relevant economic indicators, but they cannot predict the financial future with absolute certainty. We all live with uncertainty while trying to make the best decisions we can with the information available.</p><h3> Given the certainty of uncertainty, what can individuals do to best prepare for their financial future?</h3>With all of the speculation about the upcoming elections, questions about possible negative interest rates, and concerns about international instability, it&rsquo;s easy to feel anxious about the potential effects on the economy and on your savings and investments. Particularly because the airwaves and the Internet are full of news reports, commentary, blogposts and Tweets about how volatile and risky the markets are.One thing that is certain: there will always be volatility and risk in the markets. That&rsquo;s what makes the stock market the stock market. Even if we are currently experiencing a bit more than just normal market volatility, remember that the markets have historically rebounded extremely well after corrections (which are considered a drop of at least 10%). Don&rsquo;t take my word for it, take a look at the chart below:<img alt=\"\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1_13.png\" width=\"1200\"/><img alt=\"\" height=\"742\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2_14.png\" width=\"1200\"/><img alt=\"\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3_11.png\" width=\"1200\"/><strong> These charts show 27 corrections of at least 10% or more since 1987.</strong>All of those corrections had one thing in common: they all rebounded with a bullish rally. What history has shown is that, over the long run, markets continue to move higher.<strong> What does this mean for individual savers and investors?</strong>No matter your age or experience with financial planning and investments, there is one universal &ldquo;must&rdquo; that applies to everyone. You need a financial plan:  a carefully thought-out, customized financial plan, not just something you downloaded from Google. Once you have that plan in place, the next steps are to implement it, then put your head down and trust in that plan.This current market in particular highlights the importance of having a financial plan that is both age-appropriate and risk-adjusted to your specific financial situation, goals, and needs. If you&rsquo;re in your 20s or 30s, for instance, the correction we&rsquo;re experiencing is a great opportunity. Why? Because you have the luxury of time on your side. With the market currently down significantly from where it was a year ago, this is a great time to implement a <u> <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/volatility-compound-interest/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=dollar%20cost%20averaging\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  dollar cost averaging </a></u> strategy and start saving and investing on a consistent basis.One of the things that <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/robo-advisors-vs-traditional-advisors-beyond-the-red-pill-and-the-blue-pill/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=fed&amp;utm_campaign=red%20pill%20or%20blue%20pill\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> differentiates us at Sherman Wealth</a>, however, is that we believe that no two people are alike and that everyone&rsquo;s investment strategy and portfolio should be customized to suit his or her individual situation, needs, and goals. We get to know each client &ndash; or potential client &ndash; so we can analyze their actual risk tolerance in a holistic way, rather than just plugging their age and one or two other factors into a simple, one-size-fits all algorithm the way some of the Robo-Advisor platforms do. Then we create a plan that is designed to work for our clients.I can&rsquo;t tell you what the market is going to do tomorrow or six months from now &ndash; no one can. But with a well-thought-out financial plan &ndash; one that takes into consideration who you are now, where you want to be, and how much risk you can tolerate &ndash; you will feel much more confident about your own strategy and less likely to panic about what the next crazy pundit to pop up on the internet has to say.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-22 19:10:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-22 19:10:32.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_P8RYNj4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/in-times-of-uncertainty-feeling-certain-about-your-plan/\", \"post_id\": \"9401\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-22 19:10:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-22 19:10:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"in-times-of-uncertainty-feeling-certain-about-your-plan\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9396\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4494\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Top-10-Plus-Two-SEO-Blogs-of-2015.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"718\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456239600,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}

This misconception is one that can leave owners unprepared for the biggest financial event of their lives. In practice, succession planning and Exit Planning are different concepts, but ones that can work in unison to achieve an owner&rsquo;s overall exit goals.</p><h3> Succession Planning: Business-Centric</h3><p> <br/> Succession planning relates to a business, specifically its continuity of leadership and management when one owner leaves and another takes over. Certainly, continuity is an essential aspect of Exit Planning, but succession planning is business-centric, not owner-centric. If your client is the departing owner, succession planning addresses the needs and objectives of your client&rsquo;s business, not those of your client.</p><h3> Exit Planning: Owner-Centric</h3><p> <br/> Exit Planning, on the other hand, is the comprehensive analysis of all of the factors that impact the departing business owner. Exit Planning includes managing the succession aspect of leaving a business, but it also addresses a wider range of issues critical to your owner-client; namely can your client leave the business when they wish, for the money they need, and to their chosen successor? In Exit Planning we identify, create and execute the unique combination of strategies and steps necessary to achieve the owner&rsquo;s goals and aspirations.</p><p> Properly crafted Exit Plans share several common elements that we organize into seven steps.</p><p> <strong>  Step 1: </strong> Establish Owner Objectives</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: </strong> Quantify Business and Personal Financial Resources</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: </strong> Maximize and Protect Business Value</p><p> <strong>  Step 4: </strong> Ownership Transfers to Third Parties</p><p> <strong>  Step 5: </strong> Ownership Transfers to Insiders</p><p> <strong>  Step 6: </strong> Business Continuity</p><p> <strong>  Step 7: </strong> Personal Wealth and Estate Planning</p><p> We will describe each of these in the next seven articles.</p><p> As you can see succession planning and Exit Planning are not incompatible. In fact, succession planning (Step Six) is an important element of Exit Planning.

They left the meeting seeming very committed to moving forward but they wanted time to think and review all that you shared. You promised to follow up. A week has passed; you have left two voice messages with no response and are feeling rather discouraged. You are questioning their commitment to moving forward but more importantly you are even questioning yourself:</p><li> <strong>  Are they avoiding me? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Did I say something to turn them off? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Have they decided not to work with me but don&rsquo;t want to tell me? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Should I have made different recommendations? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Those gremlins begin to seep into your brain causing you to question your value. Each time you call you feel like a stalker and only get discouraged further. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop you from pondering over every question:</p><li> <strong>  Maybe they expect you to keep following up? </strong></li><li> <strong>  But if you just stop calling will you be walking away from a great opportunity? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  REALITY: </strong> While there are a small percentage of cases where the prospect has no intention of doing business with you, MOST of the time (probably around 95%) they have every intention of doing business with you, they are simply busy or distracted. But how do you know the difference?  How do you get the ball moving again in a positive direction?</p><p> <strong>  SOLUTION: </strong> Put the ball in their court.  In most cases your instincts were correct, they like you and what you have to offer but have become distracted. When you have left two messages your third call should be honest, candid with a touch of humor expressing your unique personality. This final call will release you of further responsibility while motivating them to call you back.</p><p> <strong>  SCRIPT: </strong>  &ldquo;Hi Mr. and Mrs. Smith, it&rsquo;s (your name) again, when we last met you asked me to follow up but after leaving a few messages I&rsquo;m starting to feel a little bit like a &ldquo;stalker&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s really not my style.  So while I am confident we can (improve your situation, solve your issues&hellip;.) I&rsquo;m going to put the ball in your court. You know where to find me, when you are ready just let me know. Have a great day&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  IMPACT: </strong> In most cases this call will make them feel guilty and inspire an immediate response. They may even call apologetic stating life got too busy but &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we have just been so busy. Yes, we want to get started, what do we need to do next?.&rdquo; If they don&rsquo;t call you back you have just saved yourself a lot of time, energy and angst allowing you to move on to new opportunities and prospects who appreciate your value.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 15:42:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 15:42:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_JEpvtqi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-motivate-prospects-to-call-you-back/\", \"post_id\": \"9405\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 15:42:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 15:42:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-motivate-prospects-to-call-you-back\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9404\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4496\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-To-Motivate-Prospects-To-Call-You-Back.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"387\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456316100,"author_id":5,"chart_url":""}

If you do not have flexible work options, show your boss the mounting research on flex options and increased productivity.</p><h3> 3. Seek empowering workplace cultures</h3><p> Bigelow was in the director&rsquo;s chair. Workers who have more decision-making authority over their daily job functions are less susceptible to stress, burnout, and absenteeism.</p><h3> 4. Age and experience matter</h3><p> Women of a certain age are just moving into their own. Forget about ageism in Hollywood casting lineups: direct the movie and do the casting.</p><h3> 5. Working smart</h3><p> Long hours are not the way to the boardroom. Use your time wisely.</p><h3> 6. The engineer&rsquo;s mindset</h3><p> The strong demand for women in fields such as engineering is re-engineering outdated mindsets. Keep in mind that today you have more power in the equation.</p><h3> 7.

Both are developed based on a love for something you were exposed to from the time you were born until now. You fell in love with it. You became interested in it and then  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2014/07/02/3-practical-ways-to-find-your-lifes-passion-and-a-career-you-love/#46d386e1d8bb\" target=\"_blank\">   passionate  </a> </u>  about it. You genuinely love it.</p><h3> You still love it despite how challenging it is.</h3><p> <br/> Any purpose has to have pull. You are attracted to it no matter the odds, obstacles, naysayers, or whatever. You realize anything worthwhile will have opposition of some magnitude. Your true purpose will likely have obstacles of mega-proportions. Regardless, you won&rsquo;t care what stands between you and it because nothing can stop you from achieving it. You truly believe this.</p><h3> You haven&rsquo;t figured out &ldquo;the how&rdquo; yet and that mystery drives you.</h3><p> <br/> I often preach you need to figure out what you want first and how to get it second. Too many give up because they don&rsquo;t know &ldquo;how.&rdquo; If you know &ldquo;what&rdquo; and want it badly enough,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Out-Reach-but-Sight-Impossible/dp/1493739980/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390938320&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=out+of+reach+but+in+sight\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you will figure out &ldquo;how.&rdquo;  </a> </u>  I promise.</p><h3> You&rsquo;ll need a significant amount of time to &ldquo;accomplish it.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Anything that comes too easily or too quickly won&rsquo;t be as rewarding or have the staying power. There simply isn&rsquo;t enough pull to keep you interested. Your purpose will likely require years of effort and include many twists and turns. It will also require more than a few &ldquo;self discussions&rdquo; where you question your love for it, talk yourself back into it, and reach new heights that keep driving you to the next level.</p><h3> It will affect several aspects of your life.</h3><p> <br/> Nothing truly rewarding touches only one aspect of your life. You&rsquo;re a complex being with several, important compartments to your life. Your health (mental and physical), family, friends, colleagues, work, hobbies, and so forth will all be affected&mdash;positively&mdash;by your true purpose. At different moments during your life, you will have to rebalance certain areas to achieve your purpose. But, this rebalance will never reach a tipping point. Your purpose will ultimately make all aspects of your life better in the long run.</p><h3> It will positively impact many others.</h3><p> <br/> This world is bigger than any one person. In some fashion, we&rsquo;re all meant to  <u>  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/how-our-words-impact-others.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   impact others in a rewarding way  </a> </u> . The happiest people you&rsquo;ll ever meet&mdash;I guarantee this&mdash;are the ones who have made a major contribution to improving the lives of others.</p><h3> Your loved ones and friends continually tell you, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re great at this.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Interestingly, your greatest personal gifts and talents are often more easily recognized by others than by you. I stopped long ago trying to figure out why that&rsquo;s the case. Just go with it. If you hear others remarking, &ldquo;You should do that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your calling,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The world needs this from you,&rdquo; you should listen.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 16:38:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 16:38:54.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_C6nR8o5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/7-signs-you-found-your-purpose/\", \"post_id\": \"9411\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 16:38:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 16:38:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"7-signs-you-found-your-purpose\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9410\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4499\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/7-Signs-You-Found-Your-Purpose.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1107\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456531200,"author_id":33,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4334,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Are You Still Making These 7 Lead Generation Mistakes?","link":"are-you-still-making-these-7-lead-generation-mistakes","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> With so many things on your to do list, improving your lead generation might not be on the top of that list.</h3><p> <br/> Mistakes in lead generation can cost your business significantly, and inefficiencies in this aspect of marketing can cause you to lose income that you didn&rsquo;t even know  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you could have earned  </a> </u> .</p><p> But what are the most common mistakes that businesses make and how can they be avoided?</p><h3> 1. Not Understanding Your Ideal Customer</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s necessary to research your audience; you know that. But consider also your ideal customers &ndash; the ones that are a great fit for your company (and your company is a great fit for theirs). It&rsquo;s helpful to put a name and a face with the ideal customers you have, along with some characteristics. We call these  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/building-rock-solid-client-personas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer personas  </a> </u> . To whom would your product and service appeal precisely and directly?</p><p> Of all the potential customers who are intrigued by your product, some will conform to your ideal customer more closely than others. This is something to consider in your advertising, content marketing, website, etc. You can&rsquo;t appeal to everyone, so appeal to the type of company your business is made for.</p><h3> 2. Ignoring Mobile Platforms</h3><p> <br/> A fact of modern life is that more and more people access the Internet through mobile devices than ever before, and the proportion is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trending upward  </a> </u> . Equip your website to handle this demographic and increase the pool of potential leads your business can attract.</p><p> For starters, having a mobile friendly website is something that you have to accomplish. Mobile friendliness of your website factors into Google rankings when people search from their phone. To learn more about why a mobile friendly website is critical today,  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/why-your-business-needs-a-mobile-friendly-website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   click here  </a> </u> .</p><p> If a visitor comes to your website on a smartphone and needs to &ldquo;pinch and zoom&rdquo; just to read what you&rsquo;re about, they&rsquo;ll have a poor experience and may just take their business elsewhere.</p><h3> 3. Sales and Marketing Inconsistency</h3><p> <br/> Different people within your organization will inevitably have different priorities; too much independence for sales and marketing teams can lead to an inconsistent message that sabotages your efforts at the ground floor.</p><p> It might be like this at your company: Sales reps and business development reps want to spend their time on &ldquo;good leads.&rdquo; Marketing wants to increase lead volume. Then sales and business developers go into a hard sales approach. Marketing wants to provide more educational content to aid in the sale, but don&rsquo;t get to.</p><p> The solution is for sales and marketing to gain agreement on what criteria determine a perfect lead, and also what collateral will be needed during the sale. It&rsquo;s okay to lock your teams in the same room together for a few hours until everyone is on the same page. It&rsquo;s good to get your marketing and sales/business development teams together to map out the lead generation and sales process to see where each team can provide input and feedback.</p><h3> 4. Not Stating Customer-Focused Benefits</h3><p> <br/> Do your ideal customers want to read about your product&rsquo;s features? The latest company press release? Maybe, but  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-chasing-away-new-business-opportunities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   only so far as those things benefit them  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s fine to advertise product features, but that those must support the overall message: &ldquo;You have a goal, and this is how this product can help you achieve that goal.&rdquo;</p><p> Think of it this way &mdash; people aren&rsquo;t as interested in the features until they find out that your product or service can actually solve their problem. Are you communicating that to them clearly on your website?</p><h3> 5. An Inadequate Content Strategy</h3><p> <br/> The saying goes that &ldquo;content is king,&rdquo; and while this is true, the content must be planned and coordinated to appeal to your target audience. It&rsquo;s not enough to have great ideas, flashy design or even impeccable marketing sense. Your content must be delivered in an organized fashion that conforms to your underlying philosophy or it won&rsquo;t be as effective as it could be.</p><p> A  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/content-marketing-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing plan  </a> </u>  can help you plan what you need to create, where it should be promoted, and map out a deliberate path to lead conversion. That includes how you&rsquo;ll treat email, social, PR, outreach, blogging, paid advertising and more.</p><h3> 6. Insufficient Credibility</h3><p> <br/> At its core, you&rsquo;re in the business of persuasion. It&rsquo;s an ancient art form, and you can go a long way by adapting your work to the strategy of rhetorical appeal. Your audience wants to know who you are and why they should trust what you say. They want to limit their risk of failure when they buy your product or service. Honest marketing can build credibility. Address cost and common questions you get in the sales process.</p><p> Take a look at this video from River Pools and Spas. The video is educational, not salesy, and addresses several questions that their customers have when thinking about a retaining wall for a pool.</p><p> You might also think about simpler approaches &ndash; things like adding testimonials or simple case studies to your website. Also including industry association affiliations on your website is a simple way to add credibility.</p><h3> 7. Your Website Lacks Calls to Action</h3><p> <br/> Prospects aren&rsquo;t going to contact you unless you ask them to.</p><p> Each page on your website should act as a funnel for your leads, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/ingredients-for-an-effective-call-to-action/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   calls to action  </a> </u>  are an integral component of that funnel. Companies often write web pages from their viewpoint. What do you customers want to read? What is a logical next step? Be sure to include those subtle tidbits that guide a customer toward the next step in your relationship with them.</p><p> Consider how many business websites you visited once and never again; somewhere there was a failure of communication between you and that company. Clarity of message is the basic element of communication, and all of these mistakes represent failures of clarity. With a clear message, you can dodge these pitfalls and establish the very connections with your audience needed to grow your business.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 16:48:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 16:48:25.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Memk4V8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/are-you-still-making-these-7-lead-generation-mistakes/\", \"post_id\": \"9412\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 16:48:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 16:48:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"are-you-still-making-these-7-lead-generation-mistakes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9410\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4500\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/7-Signs-You-Found-Your-Purpose.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"259\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456336800,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4335,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Do They Mean by Long Term Investing?","link":"what-do-they-mean-by-long-term-investing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Some of the simple wisdoms you hear throughout your life are actually good for you&mdash;such as eat your peas and carrots, and invest for the long haul.</h3><p> <br/> Neither one sounds sexy, but both are proven to pay off over time. When it comes to investing your most serious money we hear the phrase, &ldquo;invest for the long run&rdquo; over and over, but how long is long term?</p><p> For some people, &ldquo;long term investment,&rdquo; means holding on for 5-10 years. For others, it&rsquo;s committing to a particular stock or fund forever, and there&rsquo;s never a right time to sell. The reality, of course, is there are plenty of situations when getting out of a long-term investment is exactly the right decision so you can put that money to work someplace else. Monitoring and reviewing your positions is part of the process. But you have to consider who is making the sell recommendation. For a commission-driven broker in the business of selling transactions, moving money around is how he makes his living. A good advisor does the opposite, and helps you remain calm to keep you on course, especially when there&rsquo;s drama.</p><p> In this post, I&rsquo;ll explain exactly what it means to own investments long term, and why short-term results can be the enemy of wealth building.</p><h3> Say No to Gambling</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First and foremost, let me explain what long term investing isn&rsquo;t. </strong> It&rsquo;s absolutely not what you see on Jim Cramer&rsquo;s TV show, Mad Money, which involves a one-man show focused on erratic buying and selling and is more about entertainment than serious investing. No, long term investing is about thinking ahead and planning how to have enough money for the rest of your life. It&rsquo;s about how to diversify your serious investments, it&rsquo;s not reacting with urgency, or trying to get lucky and make a few quick bucks. There&rsquo;s a big difference between urgent andimportant. Planning for something as meaningful and long term as how you&rsquo;ll live out the last 30 years of your life may not be urgent today, but most would agree it is important.</p><p> I&rsquo;m picking on Cramer because millions of people follow his approach to investing (at least on his TV show) but it doesn&rsquo;t qualify as an investment plan,  <u>  and he&rsquo;s the first to admit it </u> . Hopping in and out of stocks is a high-risk approach that encourages inexperienced investors to make hasty decisions to pull the trigger based on emotions without fully understanding the long-term consequences of their decisions. Hyper-trading is really intended for people who want to play along with Jim using small amounts of money they can afford to lose. That&rsquo;s why his show is called, Mad Money.</p><p> Now let&rsquo;s talk about real life investing.</p><h3> Enjoy the Ride</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The historical record is clear: time and again, studies reveal long-term returns vastly outperform short term-returns. </strong> It doesn&rsquo;t matter investment: stocks, bonds, and real estate are always better investments when you take the long view. That said, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that investing long term means not touching your positions. Pruning (selling or adjusting) your portfolio is part of a successful long-term approach, such as when you need to re-balance your portfolio to stay within your guidelines, free up capital, or if you&rsquo;ve met your investment targets.</p><p> So what does long term actually mean? Important research performed by Pu Shen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, backs up the value of holding periods of at least 15-20 years. Shen found that after analyzing the results of stocks between 1926 and 2002, (a not-so-quiet period in our history), the real returns were always positive when the holding period was at least 19 years, which was not at all the case when it came to shorter-term results. </p><p> Based on the overall stock market&rsquo;s consistent performance over the last century, the math shows you have the best chances of maximizing the value of your portfolio by keeping it invested for at least 25 years.</p><p> The question then becomes, how much of your total investment portfolio do you want to commit for 20+ years? You&rsquo;ll be more likely to stick it out if you only allocate a certain portion of your savings long term, and you&rsquo;re more likely to be successful investing in smaller amounts consistently over those longer time periods. (Think: tortoise and hare). Unless, of course you can devote hours to researching every individual company and then accurately pinpoint when to buy low and sell high. </p><h3> Beware of Quarterly Results</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s very easy to be misled if you&rsquo;re evaluating your portfolio&rsquo;s results on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Again, this can create that false sense of urgency and prompt premature, knee-jerk decisions. Emotional investing destroys retirement dreams and costs inexperienced investors a ridiculous amount of money over their lifetimes. Even the pro&rsquo;s get caught up in the game. Making drastic investment changes based exclusively off of quarterly results is a downright dangerous approach, and the inevitable outcome is that your risks will significantly increase.</p><h3> Speaking of Volatility</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no way of getting around the fact that investing has become more volatile and unpredictable and that motion can make you seasick and derail even the most solid plan. Diversification wins all battles, and ultimately, investing by its definition means you&rsquo;re putting your skin in the game, and implies you&rsquo;re going to have the patience and discipline to let those investments earn the greatest possible returns even with the up&rsquo;s and down&rsquo;s.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 17:13:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 17:13:52.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_QXwYhA8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-do-they-mean-by-long-term-investing/\", \"post_id\": \"9413\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 17:13:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 17:13:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-do-they-mean-by-long-term-investing\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9410\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4501\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/7-Signs-You-Found-Your-Purpose.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"465\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456311600,"author_id":372,"chart_url":""}

And while that may not usually have much to do with your finances, this year&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://oscar.go.com/news/nominations/best-picture-nominations-2016-oscars\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best picture nominees  </a> </u>  are chock full of money lessons that will prove valuable long after the awards are handed out next Sunday.</p><h3> <strong>  The Big Short </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Big Short </a>  is all about the why, what and (most importantly) how of the 2008 financial crisis. From my perspective, the real lesson for investors doesn&rsquo;t come from watching a band of misfits leverage a highly unique opportunity into big profits. These were the (very) few who made big money from the housing crash.</p><p> The tragic stories of what happened are of regular people who lost their homes and their fortunes. As a financial advisor, this was one of the most difficult times in my career. My clients and friends were swept up in the real estate frenzy. So many people came to me asking, &ldquo;How much house can we afford?&rdquo; When I gave a true and honest answer&mdash;which included putting 20% down, staying away from adjustable rate mortgages, and looking at the long term&mdash;they thought I was a crazy, ignorant dinosaur. Sadly, some didn&rsquo;t take my guidance and bought because they were caught up in the noise. &ldquo;All of our friends are buying! We&rsquo;d be nuts not to invest when it&rsquo;s a buyer&rsquo;s market!&rdquo; The movie&rsquo;s depiction of a Florida stripper with five homes may have been a dramatic illustration, but smart people believed that the market was different this time, and real estate was the quick fix.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson learned: </strong>  In any risky market, there will be big winners&mdash;and big losers. When you see an opportunity that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stay focused on your strategy, make decisions based on reality (not frenzy), and be a winner for the long term.Not sure you have enough to get by?

Even when all seemed lost, he went back to the basics: his knowledge of science and rationing his resources. With no food or water on Mars and very limited supplies on hand, he leveraged every resource he had to create what he needed. To grow food, he used seeds from the potatoes he had (fertilized with excrement that was stored on board). To make water, he combined unused fuel from his vehicle with carbon dioxide from his own body (plus a lot of plastic tenting). He figured out how to use old technology to communicate with NASA. And, through it all, he analyzed how long he had to make his resources last, and he rationed what he had to make it happen.</p><p> <strong>  Lesson learned:  </strong> Planning for your future requires a lot of the same skills. Carefully build your financial resources, leverage the money you accumulate to build more wealth and, once you stop working, budget what you have to be sure it can support you through what is hopefully a nice, long retirement.

Not only because it&rsquo;s a wonderful, intriguing spy movie, but because it offers the most important financial (and life) wisdom of the year.</p><p> Tom Hanks is Jim Donovan, an unassuming and quiet lawyer who gets wrangled into defending an accused Russian spy at the height of the Cold War. The spy, Rudolf Abel (brilliantly played by Mark Rylance) is a painter with a deep, quiet soul. Even as he is accused, put to trial, and faces a potentially deadly return to his home country, his integrity and his unwaveringly calm and unworried demeanor remain. Multiple times in the film, Donovan asks him, &ldquo;Do you never worry?&rdquo; Abel&rsquo;s consistent response: &ldquo;Would it help?&rdquo; The words struck me over and over again as I watched this man face a series of complex, frightening situations with the same quiet resolve. He was grounded in his own truth, knew that worrying would not change the outcome, and focused on living his life in the beauty of the moment.    </p><p> <strong>  Lesson learned: </strong>  When it comes to money, it&rsquo;s easy to worry, but if you have a careful, long-term strategy in place, you should be able to sit quietly and let your money work for you. Ignore the headlines, don&rsquo;t focus on the short-term ups and down of the market, and don&rsquo;t worry. After all, &ldquo;Would it help?&rdquo; Want to know why I&rsquo;m not worried about the markets?

Here&rsquo;s the quick rundown of the rest:</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663202/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Revenant  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Room  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mad Max: Fury Road  </a> </u>  were about as different as you can get, but they all focused on surviving&hellip;and thriving. Each of the main characters showed resiliency and a keen ability to adapt to any and every new circumstance that came their way. Lesson learned: Make a plan, adjust it as needed, and live happily ever after.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381111/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Brooklyn  </a> </u>  is a beautiful film about personal choices. Lesson learned: Whether you have few options or many, be sure to make the choices that support your financial life and your life as a whole. Here&rsquo;s to finding true joy.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895587/combined\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Spotlight  </a> </u>  tells a fascinating, real-life story about journalists who do what it takes to reveal the truth&mdash;even when they&rsquo;re pressured to make headlines. Their goal was to do the right thing and serve the victims, rather than take the quick and easy route. Lesson learned: Too many journalists are paid to create stories that generate advertising revenue and miss the real story. When it comes to your money, ignore the headlines and focus on getting the facts.</p><p> If you have time, I highly recommend rolling out your own red carpet, popping some champagne, and taking in each of these great films&mdash;with at least a bit of an eye (of course!) to what they say about you, your money, and the choices you make that support a truly rich life in every way.

And yet, so often this focus is absent in influence-based conversations.</p><p> Whether it&rsquo;s tackling someone&rsquo;s non-performance, getting buy-in to a new strategy, or bidding for limited resources, if others can&rsquo;t connect with WHY, it will be virtually impossible to exact change in their behaviour or opinions.</p><p> <strong>  Sidebar: </strong> it&rsquo;s way more effective to  <u>  ask a powerful question </u>  that gets your audience to think for themselves, rather than merely telling them why they should take a particular course of action.</p><p> By asking the right questions, you are far more likely to influence positive change or unblock barriers to progress. And remember &ndash; seek to understand before you seek to be understood. Listening and gaining the other person&rsquo;s perspective is key to influencing.</p><p> <strong>  Listening and gaining the other person&rsquo;s perspective is key to influencing. </strong></p><p> Here are 5 questions to ask when influencing change in others:</p><h3> 1. What would success look like (and feel like) in this situation? What would we be seeing if we were successful in this scenario? How does the current situation/solution fit this picture of success? </h3><p> <br/> Every stakeholder needs to be crystal clear and on the same page with what success actually is before you can move forward with action points. Don&rsquo;t move into solution mode until you&rsquo;re completely comfortable you are all aligned. A common mistake in leadership is to assume that just because you have a clear picture of success in your mind, others do too.</p><h3> 2. If you/we can&rsquo;t achieve X, what will that be like? What will be the consequences of inaction?</h3><p> <br/> For example, if the consequence of not changing behaviour is getting fired, or your team member not achieving the promotion they want, that might be worth getting super specific about!</p><h3> 3. What is the drive for you? What is motivating you (or not) when considering X?</h3><p> <br/> You might be surprised at the answer. What motivates you might be very different to the other person. Knowing what drives someone (or what repels them) is vital for influencing change.</p><p> <strong>  Knowing what drives someone (or what repels them) is vital for influencing change. </strong></p><h3> 4. On a scale of 1- 10 (when 1 is &lsquo;meh&rsquo; and 10 is &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sell my grandma to achieve this&rdquo;) where are you sitting on this?</h3><p> <br/> Note: anything less than an 8 means there is more work to do before you agree what next steps to take.</p><h3> 5. Why is this important?</h3><p> <br/> These excruciatingly simple (yet incredibly important) four words can produce eye watering epiphanies when attempting to influence others towards thinking or behaving in a certain way. Once again, it&rsquo;s considerably more skilled to ask someone this, rather than tell them why it&rsquo;s important.</p><p> Bonus tip: Don&rsquo;t stop after one answer.

{"original_id":4339,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The End of Money","link":"the-end-of-money","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> What is money? It turns out economists don't have a terribly rigorous definition for it; <br/>  </h3><p> there's no consensus definition of money beyond the old tripartate \"medium of exchange,\" \"medium of account,\" \"medium of storage\" baloney, which neatly avoids defining medium (which I thought was the whole point). You can take the modern-physics point of view that matter (mass) cannot, itself, be defined, except through its interactions and behaviors. Hence, money should not have to be defined except through its behaviors. Which is fine and good, except that modern economics, with its Rube Goldberg mathematics, is (unlike physics) pretty much a pile of shit when it comes to predicting anything worth knowing. Economics is not physics.</p><p> The usual childish way of \"explaining\" money is to point out that before money, trade had to be conducted in terms of barter. This fairy tale overlooks the fact that no important economy in human history was ever barter-based, and coins (which date to maybe 700 BCE) are a fairly late development. The Egyptians, Sumerians, and others (e.g., South American cultures) had extensive \"systems of account\" long before coins were invented. The concept of accountable wealth was already quite old, in fact, when this curious thing known as moneyappeared. <br/> <br/> Steve Roth does an excellent job of summarizing the poor state of \"what we know about money\" in his fine post  <u>  <a href=\"http://evonomics.com/did-money-evolve-you-might-not-be-surprised/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Did Money Evolve? You Might (Not) Be Surprised  </a> </u> , which I won't try to recap here. One of the key contributions of Roth's article comes at the very beginning, when he points out:</p><p> [E]xchange, trade, reciprocity, tit for tat, and associated notions of &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; and &ldquo;just deserts&rdquo; have deep roots in humans&rsquo; evolutionary origins. We see expressions of these traits  <u>  <a href=\"http://evonomics.com/the-most-perverse-story-to-justify-inequality/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   in capuchin monkeys and chimps  </a> </u>  (researchers created a &ldquo;cash economy&rdquo; where chimps were trained to exchange inedible tokens for food, then their trading behaviors were studied),  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3242362/\" target=\"_blank\">  in human children </a>  as young as two, in domestic  <a href=\"http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?pid=S0121-54692015000100010&amp;script=sci_arttext\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  dogs </a> , and even in  <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056885\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  corvids </a>  &mdash; ravens and crows.</p><h3> This gets to the heart of the matter, because money does seem to be a uniquely human abstraction of the much larger, more universal notion of reciprocal behavior seen in other species.</h3><p> <br/> It's an abstraction that relies on concepts of numeracy, atomicity, equivalence (something can be a token for something else), and social exchange. It's a method of account for reciprocity, an acknowledgement that fairnesss can be ratified mathematically. Money is simply the artifact that embodies these principles&mdash;principles of accountable fairness. <br/> <br/> So if we put our sociological hats on (recognizing that money is inherently a social construct; it makes no sense to have money if no one else is around), and if we understand money as a system of account for reciprocity, it's somewhat easier to understand the rise of democracy in ancient Greece (coming around the same time, and in the same place, as the invention of coins); it's easier to understand the emergence of capitalism (and its association with the emergence of paper money); and it's also somewhat easier to comprehend the current deterioration of democracy (which I write about all the time in this blog), and rise in inequality, as a delapidation of fairness, economically expressed, culminating&mdash;surprise!&mdash;in all the recent chatter about the need to ban cash. <br/> <br/> As Western society (the capitalist democracies, now taken over by corporate elites) lets slip the basic principles of fairness upon which it was founded, it's no surprise that we see  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2016/02/larry-summers-its-time-to-kill-100-bill.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   story  </a> </u>  after  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-11/here-real-reason-why-authorities-want-ban-high-denomination-bank-notes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   story  </a> </u>  about the supposed desirability of eliminating currency. Cash is the ultimate symbol of reciprocity, but there is nothing reciprocal or symmetric or fair in what the owner class has in mind for the underclasses. We should not even demand to be paid! We should simply give all wealth to the owners, and let them take care of us as they see fit. This is the constant message of Wall Street, the Koch brothers, the GOP, and yes, even the Democratic techno-elite (aptly represented by the Clintons). They want it all. They won't be satisfied until the top 0.1% own and control all wealth, at which point (obviously) it makes no sense, any longer, for anyone to have \"money.\"</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 18:04:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 18:04:24.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_rqQtVfW.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-end-of-money/\", \"post_id\": \"9421\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 18:04:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 18:04:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-end-of-money\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9420\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4505\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-End-of-Money.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"969\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456320600,"author_id":263,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4340,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Divorce Affects Paying For A Child's College Tuition","link":"how-divorce-affects-paying-for-a-childs-college-tuition","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Another academic year is drawing to a close, and many high school seniors now have their sights set on starting college in the fall. </strong> Meanwhile, for younger students, the college search process is just beginning. Wherever you are as a parent on this spectrum, you&rsquo;re probably facing a variety of uncertainties and unknowns. Students wonder about curriculums, possible majors and campus life; you&rsquo;re undoubtedly grappling with much more practical issues, like &ldquo;How much will tuition cost?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Can we afford it?&rdquo;</p><p> When you&rsquo;re divorced, or in the process of divorcing, the questions are multiplied &ndash;and they&rsquo;re usually more complicated to answer. Let me tackle a few of the most common concerns:</p><h3> Do divorced parents have any obligation to pay for their children&rsquo;s college education?</h3><p> <br/> In general terms, child support payments stop when children reach the &ldquo;age of emancipation,&rdquo; which in most states, is between age 18 and 21. That means, unless ordered by the courts, there is typically no legal obligation to pay college tuition.</p><p> The courts can order a parent to pay for their child&rsquo;s education &ndash;but that depends on the state in which the divorce occurs. Most states allow courts to order the non-custodial parent to help pay for college. But a few do not, except in those cases where the parents had a previous agreement (as below).</p><h3> Can support for college be included in a divorce settlement agreement?</h3><p> <br/> Yes! The best way to secure funds for college tuition is to include the obligation in your divorce settlement agreement. (This would be in addition to any other alimony and/or child support agreements.) You can: 1) have the funds put into an escrow or trust account to make sure they are available when needed, or 2) get an up-front lump sum payment.</p><h3> What is included in a college support agreement?</h3><p> <br/> A college support agreement typically includes details such as what percentage of college expenses each parent is responsible for, limits on payments, restrictions on which college the child should attend, exactly what expenses will be covered, etc. As you can imagine, each one of these details usually involves negotiation.</p><p> For example, since the true cost of college includes everything from tuition, room and board, and books to extracurricular activities and a perhaps even a monthly allowance, figuring out who&rsquo;s going to pay for what can be quite complex.</p><p> Limits to payments can be problematic, too, and may involve intricate stipulations. In New York, for instance, many divorcing parents agree to limit their contribution to what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;SUNY Cap.&rdquo; This cap limits a parent&rsquo;s obligation to a percentage of the cost of a State University of New York (SUNY) school. In other words, regardless of where the child attends college, if the SUNY Cap is applied, the parent is obligated to pay only the amount specified in the cap. (Parents in other states may agree to limits based on tuition at state schools in their area.)</p><h3> How does custody factor in?</h3><p> <br/> When custody is split, the calculations are even more complicated. Generally, however, the courts want to see that the numbers balance and that one parent is not unfairly burdened with college costs. Factors such as how much each parent earns, the tuition expenses and other child care costs are folded into the equation.</p><h3> Why might an up-front lump sum payment be preferable to recurring payments?</h3><p> <br/> Particularly if your child(ren) are young, it may be preferable to negotiate  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2011/06/01/upfront-lump-sum-payment-or-alimony-why-some-nfl-ex-wives-are-now-smiling/#64f3515b4f02\" target=\"_blank\">   a lump sum payment up-front  </a>  , </u> assuming there are sufficient assets available. When your child(ren) reach college age, you&rsquo;ll have these funds in-hand to help pay the tuition bills &ndash;provided you have put those aside and invested them wisely.</p><p> Please be aware that ascertaining the future costs of college can be very difficult, especially if your children are young, and unfortunately, most divorce attorneys don&rsquo;t have the training or expertise to compute complex projections of future college costs and what the present value of those future costs would be in today&rsquo;s dollars. A consultation with a divorce financial advisor can help you better understand all the options available and help you plan for a stable financial future for you and your children.</p><p> <strong>  Reminder: </strong>  Paying for college tuition is a significant undertaking. It requires thoughtful planning to ensure the best possible outcome &ndash;for your child and for your financial future.</p><p> <strong>  Hot Tip: </strong>  Research all the options for financial aid available for higher education, beginning with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( <u>  <a href=\"https://fafsa.ed.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   FAFSA  </a> </u> ). Never hesitate to make direct phone calls to individual schools to get clarification of their specific requirements for financial aid eligibility &ndash;and be sure to check for any school-specific deadlines you may not otherwise be aware of. Please, make these calls early in the college selection process, to avoid your prospective student getting their heart set on a school that won&rsquo;t make the best financial sense.</p><p> <strong>  Legal Matters: </strong>  Regardless of which parent claims the child on his/her tax return, the custodial parent is the one who must complete the FAFSA form. So if, for example, your ex-husband makes $500,000 a year in his business, and you, as custodial parent, make a tenth that much working part time from home, your child would likely be eligible for more financial aid if the eligibility is determined based on your income alone. However, if you remarry, your new spouse&rsquo;s income and assets have to be listed on the FAFSA. Unfortunately, while it may not seem fair, that can lower your child&rsquo;s eligibility for financial aid.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 18:28:02.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 18:28:02.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_xQ1Y3zP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-divorce-affects-paying-for-a-childs-college-tuition/\", \"post_id\": \"9423\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 18:28:02\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 18:28:02\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-divorce-affects-paying-for-a-childs-college-tuition\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9422\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4506\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Divorce-Affects-Paying-For-A-Child\\u2019s-College-Tuition.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1463\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456309800,"author_id":224,"chart_url":""}

Use the following 10-Question NextGen checkup to assess where you stand:</p><h3> NextGen Marketing <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Do you strategically network with NextGen investors?  </strong> <br/> If you&rsquo;re not meeting them in the community, it&rsquo;s very hard to sell to them. If you&rsquo;re wondering where to find young investors, check out  <u>  <a href=\"http://wealthmanagement.com/prospecting/stephen-and-kevin-show-episode-9-young-affluent-teaching-cois-linkedin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Episode 9 of The Stephen and Kevin Show  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  2. Do you use LinkedIn in your marketing efforts? </strong> <br/> NextGen investors do look you up online. What are they finding? Do you know how to run Advanced Searches to find young professionals in your area? Here are our top 3 LinkedIn tips from  <u>  <a href=\"http://wealthmanagement.com/practice-management/stephen-and-kevin-show-episode-10-top-3-linkedin-sales-tactics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Episode 10 of The Stephen and Kevin Show  </a> </u> . </p><p> <strong>  3. Do you have one or more NextGen referral alliances?  </strong> <br/> All else equal, younger CPAs and attorneys, have younger clientele than their veteran peers. Develop these relationships now and you&rsquo;ll likely have them for your entire career.</p><p> <strong>  4. Do you host intimate client events that are built for NextGen? </strong> <br/> Pick topics that are interesting and times that are convenient. Craft beer tasting right after work or brunch? Doable!</p><p> <strong>  5. Do you engage your existing NextGen clients socially? </strong> <br/> Getting social increases the referral flow.  Even if they&rsquo;re not your largest, schmooze your NextGen clients. Our 2016 Affluent Investor Study shows that WOMI travels faster amongst Millennials than any other demographic &ndash; amplified by social media.</p><h3> NextGen Relateability <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. What type of car do you drive?  </strong> <br/> Most NextGen investors can&rsquo;t relate to Grandma&rsquo;s Buick or the largest Mercedes on the market.  This means, you need to be conversant on the latest well-priced cars used by young professionals. </p><p> <strong>  2. When in meetings, do you use a notepad or an iPad?   </strong> <br/> NextGen investors are digital natives and appreciate others who are fluid with technology.</p><p> <strong>  3. What type of cell phone do you use?  </strong> <br/> Having a flip phone or Blackberry is an easy &ldquo;tell&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re out of touch. Having a current smart phone is the first step, but being able to use it effectively speaks volumes. </p><p> <strong>  4. Are you an active user of LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram?  </strong> <br/> Not being on social media is seen as not being current.  Get familiar with mobile-first social networks like Instagram and Snapchat.</p><p> <strong>  5. What type of headshot do you have on your website and social media accounts?  </strong> <br/> Keep your photo current &ndash; even if you looked younger in that picture from ten years ago &ndash; it still looks like a picture from ten years ago.</p><h3> Attracting NextGen clients takes time, dedication, and delayed gratification.

{"original_id":4342,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Regrets of Owning a Second Home","link":"regrets-of-owning-a-second-home","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I am a fifth generation Texan and it has long been ingrained in me that real Texans have ranches and clear brush and shoot targets on the weekends. </h3><p> <br/> I grew up in a nice area of West Houston where it felt like all of my friends&rsquo; families owned a ranch, lake house, or beach house in Galveston.  On any given Monday you could overhear someone talking about what they did on their four wheeler or how many catfish were on their trot line when they woke up on Sunday morning.</p><p> Memories of visiting my friends&rsquo; properties, movies, and biographies of great Texans influenced Kim and I  to buy a 10 acre property in East Texas in late 2009.  We found a wonderful house that was fully furnished.  The property had a stocked pond and was very close to some great outdoor activities.  Our plan was to go out there two to three times per month and get away from city life and relax with no television.  We also envisioned a family gathering place where our families would celebrate holidays and life events.</p><p> <strong>  The first few years were terrific.  We went out there about twice a month.  I learned how to shoot guns and fish on the pond and a nearby river. </strong>   We will always cherish the great times we had out there with friends and family.  It was nice to burn brush, repair barbed wire fences, and live closer to how my ancestors did (even if only on weekends).</p><p> In the last two years, Kim and I have felt busier and busier.  We would often have plans to leave for the country house for the weekend and end up not going because a friend or family member would tell us at the last minute they were going to be in Dallas.  Our twice a month visits occasionally turned into once every two month visits due to obligations and planned vacations.  What was once so fun started to feel like an obligation.</p><p> <strong>  When you don&rsquo;t visit as much, the chores start to back up and we found that we were spending 1/4 of our time cutting cords of wood, mowing, and cleaning the inside of the house. </strong> This led me to put pencil to paper and calculate the cost per night for our paid-for vacation home.  With taxes, insurance, gas to get there, and utilities we were spending about $500 per month for a property that we owned outright.  I then figured that we were spending an average of only four nights per month there in the later years.  $500 divided by four is a whopping $125 per night&ndash;not even counting maintenance on the property.</p><p> Kim and I both have good jobs and don&rsquo;t have children. We could easily afford spending $6,000 per year for the property, but we started engaging in a conversation about the pros and cons of owning a second home.</p><h3> Advantages of Owning a Second Home</h3><p> <br/> Owning a second home has the following advantages:</p><li> It is more convenient than renting a house or getting a hotel.  You don&rsquo;t have to book it in advance and you don&rsquo;t have to worry that it isn&rsquo;t available.</li><li> You know exactly what to expect on your own property and can leave your stuff there for the next time.  It is nice to show up to a place and have all your gear ready to go without having to pack.</li><li> Because you already sunk a bunch of money into it, you are more likely to go on weekend trips to it than if you didn&rsquo;t own a place and had to pay per visit.</li><li> It could appreciate in value and diversify your assets. <br/>  </li><h3> Disadvantages of Second Home</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  We found that for us the disadvantages started to outweigh the advantages.  </strong> I am at a place in my life where I feel like less is more.  Over the last year I have sold my second car and my motorcycle with no regrets.  Those are two more things I don&rsquo;t have to worry about maintaining, paying taxes on, and getting inspected each year.  I haven&rsquo;t once regretted the decision.</p><p> I have also come around to admire the shared or on-demand economy.  Uber and Airbnb are now valued around $50 billion and $25 billion respectively and haven&rsquo;t even been in business for ten years.  Uber is more valuable than General Motors and Airbnb has a higher valuation than Marriott!  I have heard the average car sits for 23 hours per day.</p><p> If you want to buy a car for $30,000, you might have to earn $40,000 before taxes just to pay for the car.  You also have to pay for gas, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.  Not many people have considered how many actual hours they work per week just to pay for the convenience of owning a vehicle.</p><p> While I am not quite ready to go carless, I do acknowledge that the system we have in the United States is an enormous waste of resources.  Imagine how much money would be freed up in an economy where very few people owned cars and driverless vehicles would quickly pick you up and safely take you anywhere you needed to go for a small fee.  There would be less cars clogging the roadways and vehicles would become productive assets instead of depreciating away in garages and lots.</p><p> I also like the concept of Airbnb.  There are far too many underutilized properties out there.  Too many vacation properties are depreciating away under hot sunshine, torrential rains, and ice storms  and it just seems wasteful that they aren&rsquo;t getting much use and enjoyment.  I like how Airbnb and VRBO.com are freeing up a vast inventory of rooms for the enjoyment of guests.  Our East Texas Getaway was sitting empty for over 300 days a year!</p><p> We found that friends and family didn&rsquo;t come out as much as we hoped. Here is an article that shares others peoples&rsquo;  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/greathomesanddestinations/13guest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">  struggles getting visitors </a>  to come out.</p><p> The biggest hassle for us was maintaining a second home.  I have thought that hotels were overpriced my entire life.  Too me they are just a place to sleep and even at $60 per night I have not been thrilled to shell out the cash to pay for them.  After owning a second home, I feel a lot better about paying for a hotel or rental home.  There is value in having maid service and not having to maintain your own property.</p><p> The other big problem with owning a second home is that it is in the same place.  It may take years but after awhile, I always get bored with going to the same place over and over.  Eventually you have done all the different weekend excursions that you can think of and eaten at every good restaurant multiple times.  I have something in my nature that wants to explore and try different experiences and Kim and I began to realize that spending the $6,000 per year from our second home towards vacations and different experiences would be a better use of the funds.</p><p> The last reason why I would not recommend owning a second home is freedom.  The more stuff you own, the more things you have to worry about.  It is mentally freeing to not have to worry about that house anymore and to not feel like we are wasting money by not getting enough use from it.  I like having the extra dollars to now rent a room in a location that I haven&rsquo;t been before.</p><h3> Was it a Good Investment?</h3><p> <br/> We paid $135,000 for the fully furnished property about six years ago and just sold it for $200,000.  At first blush you might think we made a great investment.  It really wasn&rsquo;t when you consider all of the costs.  In six years we paid about $25,000 in property taxes and insurance alone.  Additionally we need to add in:</p><li> The cost of a new roof covered by a hail claim.</li><li> Utilities (pro tip- many rural utility companies charge a minimum amount per month just for access to the service.  For instance, our water bill was $20 per month plus a charge for actual usage.)</li><li> Interest paid on the loan while we had the loan</li><li> New floors, replaced wood around the chimney, repainted doors and columns, new hot water heater, new dishwasher, repaved driveway, doubled the size of the pond, etc.</li><li> Transaction costs of buying and selling the property. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  All in all, I estimate that we came very close to breaking even on the property. </strong>   You also need to factor in the opportunity costs of having that money tied up in a non-income producing property versus a productive portfolio of stocks and bonds.</p><p> The last benefit of not owning the property is that we will likely reach financial independence much quicker.  There are two piece to this equation: 1. We can save more each year which will build our next egg faster and 2. We don&rsquo;t need as big of a nest egg because our new retirement goal is $500 less per month than our old goal.  Many financial planners follow what has become known as the 4% rule.  It is a quick way to estimate how much you need to retire.  You take your annual spending needs and divide that number by 4%.</p><p> For example, let&rsquo;s say Kim and I had planned to spend $5,500 per month in retirement with the second house.  We would take $5,500 x 12= $66,000 / .04 to get a retirement savings goal of $1,650,000.  This portfolio would likely allow us to spend $66,000 per year with cost of living increases for the rest of our lives.  Since we no longer have the second house, we now only need to live on ($5,000 per month) $60,000 per year in retirement which means that we only need $1.5 million ($60k/.04) or $150,000 less to reach financial independence!</p><h3> Summary</h3><p> <br/> I hope my experience can help you make a better decision as to whether a second property is right for you.  Two months after the close, Kim and I have zero regrets.  After my experience, I would not recommend buying a second home.  I think most people are better off spending the same discretionary dollars on vacation rentals across the world.  If you have friends with vacation properties, accept their offers to visit because chances are they are like us and bought it to make memories and not to have it sit vacant so often.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-23 18:56:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-23 18:56:49.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_wHpacXh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/regrets-of-owning-a-second-home/\", \"post_id\": \"9426\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-23 18:56:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-23 18:56:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"regrets-of-owning-a-second-home\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9425\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4508\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Regrets-of-Owning-a-Second-Home.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"858\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456340400,"author_id":123,"chart_url":""}

Elliott once wisely said, &ldquo;We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.&rdquo; </h3><p> <br/> As I wriggle back into &ldquo;normalcy&rdquo; after vacation adventures in Puerto Rico, I find that I&rsquo;ve a whole new appreciation for this place I call &ldquo;home&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m seeing with new eyes. Sometimes stepping away can be the greatest gift we can give ourselves.</p><p> And yet there&rsquo;s discomfort too.  I&rsquo;ve forgotten my daily rhythm.  Tasks that normally come quite easily, take more effort.  I can feel myself being more tentative &ndash; lost in the sea of all-that-needs-to-be-done, wanting to disengage.  Intellectually, I know that that&rsquo;s exactly the time to focus, but physiologically and emotionally I&rsquo;m getting all the signals to cut and run.  I feel fatigued.  Heavy.  My goldfish-like-mind flitting from one thing to the next.  Overwhelmed.  Left to my own devices, I tend to will-power my way through the thick swamp of my mental yuck, only to find myself in the creative dregs with nothing fresh and new to give.  It&rsquo;s times like these that I know I need an anchor.</p><p> For me, my anchor has always been ritual.   <a href=\"http://www.jonathanfields.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Jonathan Fields </a> , in his terrific book,  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845661/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591845661&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwonstagelea-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Uncertainty: Turning Fear and Doubt into Fuel for Brilliance </a> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wwwonstagelea-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1591845661\"/> talks about ritual acting as a &ldquo;psychic bedrock&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve found it to be true.  I know that to bring my most creative, focused, high-performing-self to my work, I have to ritualize as much as I can so that, as Jonathan so eloquently says, my &ldquo;brain (has) permission to run unencumbered in the quest to create the greatest possible something from nothing.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s an incredibly useful tool that is overlooked in the corporate arena.</p><h3> Ritual can be incredibly useful if you want to bring your most creative, focused, high-performing-self to work.</h3><p> <br/> Ritual gives us something we can count on.  Jonathan calls them &ldquo;certainty anchors&rdquo; that &ldquo;counter the anxiety that comes&hellip;from living in uncertain times.&rdquo;  Writers, Artists, Actors, and other creatives have used ritual for centuries as a means to center themselves so that they can unleash their life&rsquo;s work, and perhaps it&rsquo;s time for business to do the same?</p><p> For it&rsquo;s not just post-vacation-re-entry that requires an anchor &ndash; every office is rife with need. Change is our daily diet and ambiguity the air we breath.   We expect everyone to show up to work creative and innovative and able to work at the speed of light.  That&rsquo;s simply the normal backdrop of our every-day-lives.   It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re CEO of a Fortune 500 or wearing a million different hats in a start-up, if you want to succeed &ndash; no wait&hellip;if you want to survive &ndash; it is critical to find ways to hold strong in the currents that toss us about.</p><h3> If you want to succeed &ndash; no wait&hellip;if you want to survive &ndash; it is critical to find ways to hold strong in the currents that toss us about.  Ritual helps you do just that.</h3><p> <br/> I know for me to get back into my groove, I need to reclaim my rituals &ndash; to ground myself &ndash; and over the next few days, that&rsquo;s exactly what I intend to do.  What small rituals can make up your anchor?  How can you set yourself up for success?

{"original_id":4344,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How You Can Control the Sales Cycle","link":"how-you-can-control-the-sales-cycle","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When you ask a sales person, their sales manager, or the CEO of the organization how long their sales cycles are, you usually get mixed responses.</h3><p> <br/> In some cases, you get blank stares, in other scenarios there is disagreement on the length of the actual cycle.</p><p> CEOs in general would like to see sales moving along at a healthy clip, while sales people often underestimate the time it really takes to close a sale.</p><h3> You can only change what you know</h3><p> <br/> Everybody wants to shorten the sales cycle, but in order to do that you need to first understand the length and the drivers. What do I mean by that?</p><p> There are reasons why some sales cycles are longer than others. Some of the areas are out of your control, others can be influenced.</p><p> For example, if you target larger organizations with various decision-makers and influencers, your sales cycle will automatically be longer. Sales cycles may be shorter when targeting smaller organizations, but you need to be aware of the payoffs and the trade-offs.</p><p> In other words, do those small organizations have budgets available? Are they even a good fit?</p><h3> How can you control the sales cycle?</h3><p> <br/> One way to control the length of your sales cycle is to be sure that sales team members have all received targeted training. First, sales professionals know what to look for in their ideal client profile, what industries to target, what messaging works or doesn&rsquo;t, etc. Then, they need to be trained to ask the right questions to not only uncover needs and goals of their prospects, but just as importantly, what to ask to move the sale along.</p><p> Following are some questions to ask yourself to focus on drivers which can influence your sales cycle.</p><h3> How well known is your company/brand?</h3><p> <br/> If your company is well known and you are only introducing a new service or product, it will be easier to get results. However, if your company is not established in the market place, it will take longer to get traction.</p><h3> Do you know who the decision maker for the offering will be?</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t know who your decision-maker(s) will be, it will take longer to navigate through your prospect organization. Identifying the &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; within an organization is key to being successful. Too many sales people have lengthy conversations with people who are not in a position to buy or even influence the final decision-maker(s). So, asking the right questions upfront, making sure that you are talking to the right people, and establishing rapport with the real influencers will help you shorten the cycle.</p><h3> Do you have a Unique Positioning for your service?</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t know how to differentiate your service from others in your marketplace, it will also add time to your sales cycle. It is therefore of high important to have a Unique Selling Proposition and to craft messaging that will get people&rsquo;s attention.</p><h3> Are you adding Value?</h3><p> <br/> Too many sales people focus on the features and benefits of their offering, rather than leading with value. It is important for a prospect to understand how your service/product offering will be of value to them (and remember, it&rsquo;s different depending on the role of the person).</p><h3> Are your sales people equipped to sell in a consultative environment?</h3><p> <br/> If they are not, they will not ask the right questions, get stuck with the wrong decision maker and that will have a strong impact on your sales cycle. We have a Sales IQ assessment that helps management determine whether sales people are up to par, or not.</p><h3> Does your company have a healthy sales culture?</h3><p> <br/> A positive sales culture is very important when it comes to understanding and managing the sales cycle. If you are a CEO, encourage your people to be honest. If you are a sales person, be pro-active in managing expectations.</p><h3> Are your sales people supported with training?</h3><p> <br/> If your sales people are struggling, provide them with training, but most importantly hire a training organization that you trust and then truly support that methodology.</p><h3> What is the buying cycle of your prospects?</h3><p> <br/> One area that is out of your control is the buying cycle and budget cycle of your prospects. Identify and understand their budget cycle and then manage your outreach accordingly.</p><h3> Ideas for Sales Professionals &amp; Sales Managers</h3><p> <br/> All of these areas need to be carefully reviewed and discussed, but not only by sales professionals themselves. If your CEO is involved in these discussions, you will not only have buy-in from the top, but also a profound understanding as to why things might take longer.

{"original_id":4345,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Do We Apply the 80-20 Rule Anyway?","link":"how-do-we-apply-the-80-20-rule-anyway","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> We hear the 80-20 rule, and it has repeatedly proven true: 80 percent of the outcomes come from 20 percent of the causes.</h3><p> <br/> There are so many needless meetings in the day and so many operations that don&rsquo;t play a critical role in a business that we must test new ways to allocate our resources.  <strong>  A top CEO earns 331 times more than an average worker. She can&rsquo;t be working 331 times harder, so she must be focusing on things that get more valuable outcomes. </strong></p><p> And thus the 80-20 is a great good place to focus on potential operating improvements. The key issue, though, is how we can take this concept and actually make it a part of our day in a meaningful way. While typically applied to inventory management, this concept can be applied to nearly all aspects of your business. Like most abstract concepts, though, things can get lost in translation between theory and application, so let&rsquo;s walk through how to make this important concept a habit in your daily life.</p><p> One of the biggest misconceptions is that you simply do the 20 percent that produce the big impacts and stop doing everything else. This simply can&rsquo;t work. You may not see a direct ROI on paying your electric bill, for example, but see what happens when you stop doing it. The truth is that in business, there are always things that need to get done, and not all of them are going to give you the big results. While the 80-20 rule can indeed help you identify things your business should eliminate all together, the most important lesson comes in viewing it as a matter of personal focus vs. delegation.</p><p> <strong>  As a small business owner, you are probably doing a bit of everything: </strong> Sure, you might spend time developing products or giving key presentations to expand your business, but you might also be running out to get supplies for the office, answering most of the customer service e-mails that roll in, answering inbound calls, or keeping the office presentable. The first two are valuable; the rest are not.</p><p> You might be thinking, &ldquo;But if someone doesn&rsquo;t answer the phone? How are those people going to get their concerns resolved? Answering those phone calls is important.&rdquo; </p><h3> You&rsquo;re right. Those phone calls are important, but importance is different than value.</h3><p> <br/> Those calls absolutely need to be answered, but you could invest a handful of hours to hire and train someone to take those calls and pay them $12-$15 an hour. Now you just freed up time to focus on the parts of your business that can earn $100 or $1,000 per hour.</p><p> Therein lies the key: separating the concepts of value, importance, and urgency. By hiring someone to answer your phones, for example, you are outsourcing something that is important and often urgent but not particularly valuable &ndash; meaning that the price you can put on the task itself isn&rsquo;t particularly high. In contrast, developing a new product or developing an effective marketing strategy may not feel as urgent as those calls rolling in, but it&rsquo;s substantially more valuable because it&rsquo;s the thing the earns you the most money per hour and would be expensive to outsource or delegate.</p><p> Once you understand this concept, you can apply it to all sort of other aspects of your business like delegating straightforward e-mails or even outsourcing more complex work like website management and professional services.</p><p> <strong>  When implementing an idea, often the hardest step as a business owner is the first one. </strong> Here&rsquo;s a little thought experiment to hopefully make it easier: Look around at the non-valuable processes in your business that still need to happen to keep the business functioning. Start keeping track of how many hours per week you and your staff are personally spending on those things. Then calculate how much it would cost to use some alternative processes or pay someone to handle those things and then ask yourself this question: &ldquo;If I had these hours free, could I use them to earn significantly more than what it&rsquo;d cost to pay someone?&rdquo;</p><h3> In most cases, the answer is a resounding, &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Congratulations, you just took your first step to 80-20-ing.</p><p> We&rsquo;re a curious group here at Startup Connection, so if you did this exercise, let us know what you found. Did you discover operations that you don&rsquo;t need to be doing? Did you identify parts of your business that you could outsource or delegate to increase your earning potential? We hope you did.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 16:15:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 16:15:39.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_y2gtaXm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-do-we-apply-the-80-20-rule-anyway/\", \"post_id\": \"9430\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 16:15:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 16:15:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-do-we-apply-the-80-20-rule-anyway\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9428\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4511\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-You-Can-Control-the-Sales-Cycle.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"490\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456430400,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

The reality, however, is different enough that it has many human resource experts wondering if pay-for-performance is anything more than a trendy concept.</p><p> The root of the controversy lies in the potential problems involved with paying for performance, most of which have, at their root, the same issue: paying employees for something other than what you want. If, for example, your compensation plan is based on incorrect metrics instead of your true competencies, you may be paying employees for improving at things that bear no meaning to your business&rsquo;s overall development. Or if, as is often the case, the goals your employees are working toward (and being rewarded for meeting) aren&rsquo;t clearly aligned with your company&rsquo;s true needs, then you are, again, paying for individual improvement in an area that won&rsquo;t effectively translate into improved company performance.</p><h3> These pitfalls don&rsquo;t mean, however, that pay-for-performance is a bad idea.</h3><p> <br/> Instead, it means that if you want to include pay-for-performance as part of your employee compensation plan, you have to ensure you&rsquo;ve structured the plan correctly.

{"original_id":4347,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The New Fee Pressure is Free Pressure","link":"the-new-fee-pressure-is-free-pressure","source_link":null,"content":"<p> What can be worse than competing against someone who offers to do the same work at 20% lower fees?</p><h3> That&rsquo;s easy: Competing against a firm that offers to do the same work for free.</h3><p> <br/> Free articles. Free assessments. Free podcasts and videos. Free coaching sessions. Free projects, even. Everything seems to be free these days. One of my clients said to me last week, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to compete when your competitor is giving a quarter million dollars of work away for free just to build the relationship.&rdquo; The fact is, the near-zero marginal cost of providing digital content, and of delivering services in a fixed-capacity services firm, creates momentum to give things away if the provider thinks it will win fee-paying business in the future.</p><h3> How do you make sense of this? How do you deal with competitors who are giving away the store? And what should your own strategy be?</h3><p> <br/> There are three main types of &ldquo;free&rdquo; that you now see in the marketplace. <strong>  First, there&rsquo;s giving away free intellectual property such as articles, podcasts, videos (streaming or hard copy), online assessments, and so on. </strong> Most everyone does this, and it makes sense as a way of building trust in your ability to provide value. The question is, &ldquo;If everyone is giving it away, will a strategy to charge for it work?&rdquo; The answer is yes&mdash;if clients perceive that it&rsquo;s valuable enough to pay for. Some websites give the first layer of content away for free (some articles, some podcasts) but you have to pay to get access to deeper levels (archived content, full-length articles, etc.). In professional services, my theory is that the higher your fees, the more digital content (IP) you will be willing to give away. An example of this is my friend Marshall Goldsmith, who is one of the top CEO coaches in the world and a bestselling author. Marshall gives away an enormous amount of content on his various websites, and commensurate with his global brand, charges coaching fees at the very top of the market.</p><p> <strong>  The second type of &ldquo;free&rdquo; comprises free samples&mdash;a free keynote speech or workshop, a free coaching session, or a free assessment that may take several or more days of time. </strong> Here&rsquo;s where things get a little dicey. Investing significant time up-front to get to know a potential client and thoroughly understand their issues&mdash;assuming you stand to develop a meaningful project with them&mdash;can be a great way to demonstrate value and commitment and therefore earn trust. Saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to do a free workshop for you,&rdquo; however, can set off alarm bells and is something that must be very carefully positioned in order to be effective. <strong>  Here&rsquo;s why: As a client, I may be thinking &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s &lsquo;free&rsquo; then what benefit are you getting that I don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo; </strong> Transparency builds trust, but saying it&rsquo;s free suddenly clouds the situation. So be careful to explain exactly what you&rsquo;re doing. The client may also be thinking, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so successful, why are you giving your time away for free?&rdquo; <strong>  Clients aren&rsquo;t stupid. </strong></p><p> <strong>  The third type of &ldquo;free&rdquo; is when firms give away a major piece of work. </strong> This can be a very strategic move or it can be a sign of total desperation that backfires. For example: One of my clients is expanding their strategic consulting services, and looks for opportunities to showcase this capability to clients who don&rsquo;t necessarily think of them as a player in this field. One of their clients grew dissatisfied with a large strategy consulting firm they were using, and they went in and offered to do a major piece of strategic analysis&mdash;for free. They attached conditions, however: The client would commit resources to the effort, they would have access to the CEO, and they would get to report their findings to the company&rsquo;s executive committee. It turned out to be a major success that helped reposition my client in the marketplace and grow their relationship with this company. In another case, a firm won a major, multi-year assignment with a large telecommunications company. The chairman of a competitor who lost the bid called up the CEO of the telco the day after the other firm had been chosen, and told him &ldquo;We will put together the best team from around the world to do this work for you. And we&rsquo;ll do phase 1, which represents $2 million in fees, for free.&rdquo; The CEO told him they were too late, and that his mind had been made up already.</p><p> Another client of mine has a strategic program that entails giving away one or two major projects a year to potential clients they would like to work for. They are very, very selective about how they implement this. They carefully position it as being done directly with the CEO and it is always focused on an issue of great importance to the company. They do it in a very calculated way and fund it as a firm-level initiative. It has resulted in some major, long-term relationships. You can give away work from strength&mdash;if and only if it&rsquo;s positioned properly and the circumstances are right&mdash;and you can do it from weakness, which may just make you look desperate and even pathetic.</p><p> Here are some strategies you should follow in dealing with &ldquo;free pressure&rdquo; and deciding what your own policies are:</p><li> <strong>  Refocus on the basics of your brand and your value to clients. </strong> When these are strong, it&rsquo;s easier to resist or ignore &ldquo;free pressure.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Learn to add value rapidly in your conversations with prospective clients. </strong> In the first 45 minutes with an executive, you should be challenging their thinking, forcing them to be crystal-clear about their objectives, and seeding the discussion with examples of best practices and innovative approaches to their issue. That&rsquo;s your free sample, right there.</li><li> <strong>  Know when to draw the line between investment in building the relationship and giving away the store. </strong> At a certain point you have to have the courage (and common sense!) to say to the prospective client, &ldquo;I feel that we&rsquo;re now moving into a value-added, advisory relationship and it&rsquo;s the appropriate time, in my experience, to formalize this and tell you how much it&rsquo;s going to cost.&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Focus your up-front investments in face time and building trust&mdash;not churning out long PowerPoint decks filled with methodology. </strong> The former creates emotional connections and wins business, whereas clients barely read the latter.</li><li> <strong>  Confront the &ldquo;free&rdquo; issue head-on with your client if a competitor is trying to undercut you: </strong> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve continued to be busy throughout this downturn because our clients feel they get a huge ROI on our work. I am aware that there are some firms out there giving away work, and I can only guess that they are doing this because they aren&rsquo;t busy and their business is not strong.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><p> If you do decide to give away a &ldquo;free sample,&rdquo; set out the right conditions&mdash;e.g., senior management access&mdash;and agree them with the client. &ldquo;Free pressure&rdquo; will never completely go away, but there are many things you can do to bulletproof yourself against it&mdash;and also to use it to your advantage.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 16:32:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 16:32:38.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_aLQqNlu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-new-fee-pressure-is-free-pressure/\", \"post_id\": \"9433\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 16:32:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 16:32:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-new-fee-pressure-is-free-pressure\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9432\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4513\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-New-Fee-Pressure-is-Free-Pressure.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"776\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456422300,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

Sometimes they&rsquo;re one-man-bands, or they might just have a staff of three or four. In my experience, these firms don&rsquo;t have the sufficient time to make a good job it. If yours is a larger firm you may have more capacity, but even then, do you really have the staff available and with enough hours in the day?</p><h3> Secondly, don&rsquo;t underestimate the breadth of skills you&rsquo;re going to need.</h3><p> <br/> For starters, you&rsquo;ll need  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/services/strategy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   a strategic thinker  </a> </u>  to develop a content marketing plan; this doesn&rsquo;t have to be a marketing specialist, but it helps if it is. You&rsquo;ll also need a manager, or, at least, an administrator, to oversee implementation of the plan, to ensure that everything gets done on time and to the right standard. Other skills you&rsquo;ll want to call on include  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/video-marketing-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  SEO </a> , copywriting, graphic design,  <u>  <a href=\"https://embertelevision.co.uk/services/video-production.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   video production  </a> </u>  and social marketing. Be honest, do you really have that range of skills in-house?</p><h3> Thirdly, don&rsquo;t underestimate the expense involved in content marketing.</h3><p> <br/> Whether you do it yourselves or you pay someone else to do it, it won&rsquo;t be cheap. I often hear firms say that, rather than pay an outside company, they&rsquo;re going to hire a recent graduate to do it. Are you really going to find someone of that age &mdash; or indeed any age &mdash; to provide all the skills you&rsquo;re going to need? Even if you hired, say, half a dozen fresh-faced graduates, it might take years for them to start working to the level you need them to. You&rsquo;ll also have to invest in equipment &mdash; cameras, lenses, microphones, editing software and so on &mdash; and there&rsquo;s insurance to pay for as well.</p><p> <strong>  Time and again I see firms make a start with content marketing but end up wasting resources on it and giving up. </strong> In most cases it&rsquo;s because they hadn&rsquo;t fully appreciated the time, skills or expense involved. Yes, the idea of being totally self-sufficient might appeal but, for all but the largest firms, it&rsquo;s usually unrealistic.</p><p> <strong>  The other advantage of using an external company is that they&rsquo;re not too close to what you do. </strong> Small businesses in particular can lose a grip on what the outside world thinks of them. A contractor from outside your business will view you as other people see you, including prospective clients. That&rsquo;s extremely valuable.</p><p> Sure, there may well be tasks that can be performed in-house. But outsourcing the bulk of your content marketing to firms with the relevant expertise allows you to maintain the consistent level of quality that you&rsquo;re looking for, allowing you and your colleagues time to focus on what you do best.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 16:56:22.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 16:56:22.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_UXhWhie.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/content-marketing-diy-or-outsource/\", \"post_id\": \"9434\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 16:56:22\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 16:56:22\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"content-marketing-diy-or-outsource\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9432\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4514\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-New-Fee-Pressure-is-Free-Pressure.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"334\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456421700,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The issue is with the communication of the value associated with the fees. Most advisors provide value beyond the assets under management fee structure.

Think of presenting your value by segmenting it into 3 distinct categories that each have an associated fee. For instance you could say &ndash; &ldquo;there are 3 things we do&rdquo; and then break up all of the things you do into 3 distinct categories. For instance, one advisor we work with states, <strong>  &ldquo;There are 3 things that we do: Complete Financial Planning, our Investment Process, and Family Office Services.&rdquo; </strong> He discusses each in detail and then associates a sample fee based on the value for each of the categories. In closing the conversation, he presents one overall, average fee that is less than the 3 individual segments. His clients understand it and he does not have a fee issue. His clients know his value.</p><p> You may not be ready or able to change the model in which you charge fees. But you can change the way you communicate all the value you bring.

{"original_id":4350,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Step-by-Step Conflict Resolution","link":"step-by-step-conflict-resolution","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Conflict resolution is a primary human resources function in nearly every organization. </strong> While this task is rarely an HR professional&rsquo;s favorite to tackle, conflict resolution is necessary for a positive work culture, improved productivity, risk management, and limited turnover. The good news (or the bad news) is that the outcome of conflict resolution is largely based on the mediator, who is often the HR professional. The HR professional has a responsibility to conduct a productive, meaningful conversation, keeping both employees on task and producing results that satisfy each party.</p><p> Even with the most difficult personalities, conflict resolution doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard. Following these steps can eliminate the chaos and transform conflict resolution into a calculated science.</p><h3> Choose a Private, Neutral Setting</h3><p> <br/> Conflict resolution should never be done in front of other employees, clients, or guests. Selecting a private, netural location such as a private meeting room, a human resources office, or a small conference room prevents humiliation and promotes honest conversation.</p><h3> Always Schedule in Advance</h3><p> <br/> When employees are caught off guard, they tend to show increased defensiveness, anger, and frustration. Always schedule a conflict resolution meeting in advance, and whenever suitable, tell both parties why the meeting has been scheduled. This prevents the defensiveness and other negative responses that come from a surprise attack and allows employees to gather their thoughts in advance.</p><p> If numerous employees are having interpersonal issues with the same person, schedule multiple one-on-one meetings.</p><h3> Define Clear Goals</h3><p> <br/> Once the meeting has started, the HR professional&rsquo;s first order of business is to define goals for the meeting. Defining goals establishes purpose for the meeting, which is vital for a meaningful encounter. Without established and clear purpose, conflict resolution often evolves into a never-ending merry-go-round of insults and accusations. Some possible goals for a conflict resolution meeting include:</p><li> <strong>  To establish a plan for completing a project together despite differences </strong></li><li> <strong>  To overcome differences to better provide for our clients, guests, patrons, or patients </strong></li><li> <strong>  To complete specific tasks that have been a point of conflict, such as scheduling vacations, defining roles, or making decisions </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Overcoming differences between employees ultimately provides a more positive experience for clients, guests, patrons, or patients, so the second goal should be included in nearly every conflict resolution meeting. It draws their attention to the bigger picture and provides clear direction for the meeting.</p><h3> Give Each Party an Opportunity to Share</h3><p> <br/> Provide each person time to share their viewpoint and concerns, following basic ground rules:</p><li> <strong>  Conversation must be respectful at all times </strong></li><li> <strong>  Each party speaks in turn only </strong></li><li> <strong>  Yelling, swearing, name calling, or any other display of disrespect or aggression will end the meeting immediately and result in discipline. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Conversation should stay on task, addressing specific situations that have brought issue and not personal character </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Limit this time to 5 minutes each and don&rsquo;t allow response following statements. One person speaks, the other speaks, and then the meeting moves forward.</p><h3> Brainstorm Solutions</h3><p> <br/> While most employees who have a tense working relationship will never agree on every point, focusing on solutions can encourage them to look past disagreements to perform to their full potential. Take ample time to discuss solutions, and request ideas for resolution from each party. If either employee is quick to shoot down ideas, request a better suggestion.</p><h3> Establish a Plan</h3><p> <br/> Establish a clear plan going forward. Which employee will take on which responsibilities and when? All parties should know the plan and their specific role in it when the meeting is concluded.</p><p> Conflict resolution doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard; stick to the steps, remove personal feelings, and work to accomplish defined goals and and stay on task, and conflict resolution will no longer be laden with dread.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 17:27:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 17:27:26.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_gTWsPTO.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/step-by-step-conflict-resolution/\", \"post_id\": \"9438\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 17:27:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 17:27:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"step-by-step-conflict-resolution\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9437\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4516\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Step-by-Step-Conflict-Resolution.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"730\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456419600,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

I know that most people have seen it as well, because whenever I present to audiences about it, people will come up to me one after another with their stories of how they don't speak with a sibling or loved one because of some big or small issue related to a parents' estate.It's a reason that I wrote the book, \"<u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Having-Talk-Four-Parents-Retirement/dp/0985082038/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453740428&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=having+the+talk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Having the Talk </a></u>,\" which focuses on the ways to begin a family discussion earlier rather than later, about planning for the later life issues of a retired or retiring parent. My research showed me that most people have \"the Talk\", but they have it too late, either when there's little that can be changed, or after expectations have been set by siblings about \"who gets what.\" When this happens, families are torn apart, and loved ones who played together and protected each other throughout their entire lives now find themselves not talking to each other, usually all the way to their deathbeds.<h3> It's a dire picture, sure, but how many people reading this can think of at least one person in their family or that of a close friend where this has happened?</h3>The reality is that having this discussion and planning for these issues isn't easy, and the resources aren't easy to access. That's why I was thrilled to see a new website called \" <u> <a href=\"http://www.planbeyond.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Plan Beyond </a></u>,\" that not only provides content that helps inform individuals about the need to plan for these later life issues, but also provides access to many of the documents and forms necessary.Like me, Laura Troyani got interested in this topic when she had her own personal experience of how the execution (isn't that an ironic word for the process?) of a family member's estate could significantly impact the well being of her family.After seeing the impact this had on her family, Troyani wanted to create a resource that would \"get rid of a ton of strive, a ton of pressures that family members have to deal with.\"<strong> \"The reality is that this issue has a universality among families,\" she said.</strong>That was the impetus for Troyani to move from her position as a marketing professional with a large company to developing a website that would be \"one site where people can get better educated and have the legal resources they need\" to address the later life issues, before they get to the point where it tears a family apart.Her site, <a href=\"http://www.planbeyond.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> PlanBeyond.com</a> provides informational content about issues that most of us don't want to deal with, such as &ldquo;how to donate your body to science&rdquo; or &ldquo;how to get a death certificate.&rdquo; Her categories of content, which include funeral planning and end-of-life care may seem daunting to most, but they're necessary when addressing the end-of-life issues that tear families apart.The most compelling aspect of the site for me was the extensive library of end-of-life documents that includes the necessary documents from every state in the U.S. to help families and individuals to get their life planning in order.Laura acknowledges that dealing with these issues can be very complex and emotionally draining, but her focus is on creating a user experience that as \"simple as possible.\"\"We wanted to make it so simple that you can't help but do what needs to be done,\" Troyani said.<h3> I hope it can help families because the option of not doing anything, or doing it too late, is not an option that helps any family.</h3>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 17:36:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 17:36:13.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_K9BP59O.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-make-end-of-life-planning-easier/\", \"post_id\": \"9440\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 17:36:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 17:36:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-make-end-of-life-planning-easier\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9439\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4517\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Make-End-Of-Life-Planning-Easier.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"886\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456426800,"author_id":205,"chart_url":""}

Could We Be Next?","link":"monopoly-is-going-cashless-could-we-be-next","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Nearly everyone can recall playing Monopoly as a child, and for many, the game served as their first exposure to handling different denominations of cash.</p><h3> It was exhilarating to have someone land on your Park Place property, complete with hotel, and in turn receive a fistful of $50s and $100s.</h3><p> <br/> A new generation of players might never get the chance to experience this, however, as Hasbro Gaming just released an &ldquo;Ultimate Banking&rdquo; version of the popular board game that nixes the funny money in favor of play credit cards and an electronic scanner.</p><p> You could argue it&rsquo;s just a game, but Monopoly has always had a reputation for being a reflection of capitalism as it operates in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world (which is why it was banned in communist states such as the Soviet Union). The cashless version of the game is no exception, as it comes at a time when calls to limit&mdash;or in some cases eliminate&mdash;the use of cash are intensifying. And to be clear, &ldquo;cash&rdquo; here means cash in your pocket, not cash in the bank.</p><p> Just last week, former treasury secretary Larry Summers published an op-end in the Washington Post arguing it&rsquo;s time to &ldquo;kill the $100 bill,&rdquo; the reason being that it&rsquo;s preferred by those involved in money-laundering, corruption and other illegal activity. (One million dollars denominated in $100 bills weighs 2.2 pounds, he points out, whereas the same amount in $20 bills weighs a much more cumbersome 50 pounds.) The European Union, he argues, should also consider getting rid of the 500-euro note, a position that&rsquo;s echoed by European anti-fraud officials.</p><p> The risks far outweigh the benefits when you consider where this anti-cash sentiment is leading us&mdash;a cashless society. As I  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/sweden-declares-war-on-cash-punishes-savers-with-negative-interest-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussed back in December  </a> </u>  regarding Sweden&rsquo;s own trend toward a cashless economy, every transaction could be monitored, not to mention taxed and charged a fee. Accounts could be frozen, which, in a cashless world, would leave you with nothing. Having had  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/investor-alert/10-numbers-to-know-for-the-chinese-new-year/#.VsYiiSseouI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the opportunity to hear Secretary Summers speak  </a> </u>  when I visited Harvard recently, I respect his opinion and believe his intentions are good. But ultimately the argument to eliminate the $100 bill is based on the presupposition that anyone using such a note is a drug trafficker or money launderer. This seems to go against one of the main tents of common law, namely, that we&rsquo;re innocent until proven guilty.  </p><p> I&rsquo;ve experienced the inconvenience that sometimes comes with electronic transactions, as I&rsquo;m sure many of you have. Occasionally my credit card couldn&rsquo;t be read for one reason or another, and if you&rsquo;re not carrying cash, what do you do? When I&rsquo;m traveling, domestically or abroad, I always carry cash with me, and $100 bills are much more convenient than a pound of $20s.</p><p> Capital controls are nothing new, but they would be much easier to impose. In Colombia, a tax is levied on every transaction, whether it is a direct deposit from your employer, transfer of funds between accounts or a purchase. Since 2003, Venezuela&rsquo;s government has significantly regulated the amount of money citizens can take with them on trips abroad, in effect blocking access to foreign travel. Currently the limit is $2,000, but for travelers headed to the U.S., it drops to $700. This, along with a labyrinthine exchange rate (there are three), has only created a black market currency exchange. And since credit cards in Venezuela are issued by state-run banks, there&rsquo;s no stopping the government from restricting payment on any goods or services, or from any vendor, it wishes.</p><p> Colombia and Venezuela are extreme cases, and there&rsquo;s no reason to expect the same would ever happen in the U.S. At the same time, scrapping the $100 bill would further debase Americans&rsquo; economic liberty.</p><h3> Gold Shines on Stellar Consumer Price Index (CPI) Reading</h3><p> <br/> These concerns might be part of the reason why gold and silver coin sales are doing so well right now. The U.S. Mint began selling out of its popular American Eagle coins late last year, and demand is exceeding the mint&rsquo;s weekly allocation of 1 million ounces.

More than a fifth of the world&rsquo;s GDP is now produced in countries with subzero rates, and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently stated that the Fed will not take such rates off the table for consideration.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/GLD-key-negative-interest-rates-02192016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Key Negative Interest Rates\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/GLD-key-negative-interest-rates-02192016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Negative rates are essentially a tax on your bank deposits, intended to discourage saving. And if hard cash were no longer available to squirrel away in your mattress, gold might be the only other option.</p><p> But nominal rates aren&rsquo;t the only driver. Numerous times I&rsquo;ve written and spoken about  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/3-reasons-why-this-gold-rally-is-the-real-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   gold&rsquo;s relationship with real interest rates  </u>  , </a>  which is what you get when you subtract headline inflation from the government bond yield. When inflation rises, real rates are pushed lower, and when they turn negative, gold becomes more attractive. Last week the Labor Department reported that core inflation in January increased 0.3 percent, its largest monthly gain since August 2011, when gold reached its all-time high of $1,900 per ounce. For the 12-month period, the consumer price index (CPI) hit an impressive 2.2 percent, its strongest showing since June 2012. Both of these readings beat analysts&rsquo; estimates and should be constructive for gold.</p><p> Also helping the metal&rsquo;s appeal last week was the uncertainty surrounding whether the United Kingdom would exit the European Union. Momentum had been growing behind the &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; campaign to end economic control from Brussels, with a majority of respondents to  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12165127/New-poll-puts-Brexit-in-the-lead-as-David-Cameron-battles-to-secure-renegotiation-deal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a British poll </a>  saying they were in favor of leaving the 28-member bloc. On Friday, however, Prime Minister David Cameron  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12164607/EU-referendum-eu-summit-david-cameron-brexit-live.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  managed to secure a deal </a>  giving the UK &ldquo;vital protections&rdquo; to its economy, including never having to bail out any other EU member if it chooses not to. Gold ended the trading day up 2.3 percent to settle at $1,228.60 per ounce.</p><h3> Oil Prices Aligned with Seasonality Trade</h3><p> <br/> Oil was up last week with prices rising above their 50-day moving average, mostly on a production cap agreement between the world&rsquo;s two largest producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Historically, oil bottoms every February, and today it&rsquo;s right on cue. We are now due for a rally until Easter at least, possibly until the beginning of summer.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/COMM-west-texas-crude-oil-historical-patterns-02192016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"West Texas Crude Oil Historical Patterns\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/COMM-west-texas-crude-oil-historical-patterns-02192016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Another factor to consider is money supply. Based on our own regression analysis, there&rsquo;s a high correlation between money supply growth in the seven most populous countries and commodity prices. If you look back to 2011, when oil averaged $100 per barrel and gold peaked at $1,900, money supply was strong. Since then it&rsquo;s been falling, particularly in China, as you can see below. But with money supply on the upswing, we might have a good chance for a rally here.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/COMM-will-commodity-prices-continue-to-track-chinas-money-supply-growth-02192016-LG.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Will Commodity Prices Continue to Track China's Money Supply Growth?\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/COMM-will-commodity-prices-continue-to-track-chinas-money-supply-growth-02192016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Besides continued oversupply, oil&rsquo;s most significant headwind remains the U.S. dollar. As it has gained in strength, emerging market currencies have declined.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/COMM-US-Dollars-Uptrend-Still-Intact-Emerging-Markets-Weaken-02192016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Dollar's Uptrend Still Intact, Emerging Markets Weaken\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-02-19/COMM-US-Dollars-Uptrend-Still-Intact-Emerging-Markets-Weaken-02192016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> As always, it&rsquo;s important to follow the smart money. Just as influential &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; investor Mark Cuban went long on gold recently, we&rsquo;ve seen big-name investors place their bets that oil prices will climb. It was widely-reported last week that billionaires Warren Buffett, George Soros and hedge fund manager David Tepper all disclosed buying shares of Kinder Morgan, the Houston-based oil and gas pipeline company. Buffett&rsquo;s stake alone amounts to 26.5 million shares, currently valued at around $450 million.</p><p> In the meantime, low oil prices continue to give a lift to transportation stocks such as airlines, many of which reported record net profits for the fourth quarter.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 17:46:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 17:46:51.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_9w1TpgT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/monopoly-is-going-cashless-could-we-be-next/\", \"post_id\": \"9441\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 17:46:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 17:46:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"monopoly-is-going-cashless-could-we-be-next\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9439\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4518\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Make-End-Of-Life-Planning-Easier.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"518\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456416000,"author_id":179,"chart_url":""}

Just Ask the FDIC","link":"negative-interest-rates-in-the-us-just-ask-the-fdic","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thesovereignman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Simon Black  </u> </a> | <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sovereignman.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Soveriegn Man  </a> </u></p><p> Last week the FDIC released its annual financial statements, giving the public a glimpse into the financial condition of the organization responsible for backing up the entire US banking system.</p><h3> The numbers are pretty incredible.</h3><p> <br/> The FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is the emergency stash for nearly all bank deposits in the Land of the Free.</p><p> DIF financial statements show an incredible 54% drop in cash equivalents since last year.</p><p> This means the DIF&rsquo;s immediate liquidity is now just 1.2% of its total assets. In other words, nearly 99% of the insurance fund is tied up in various investments that may lose substantial value in the very financial crises that they&rsquo;re meant to insure.</p><p> The FDIC has stuffed much of the DIF funds in an expanding bond portfolio. Yet by its own admission, this portfolio is down $10 billion, or roughly 14%.</p><p> Plus, a good chunk of that bond portfolio has been invested in securities that earn negative interest.</p><p> It&rsquo;s incredible; the organization insuring the US banking system has actually purchased bonds that yield negative interest!</p><p> Now, including the losses, the fair market value of the DIF is about $62 billion.</p><h3> That might sound like a lot of money. But total bank deposits in the US exceeds $13 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.</h3><p> <br/> This means that the DIF has net assets available to cover less than 0.5% of all bank deposits.</p><p> In fairness, the FDIC&rsquo;s insurance fund doesn&rsquo;t need to maintain a 100% cash backing of all bank deposits; that&rsquo;s not how insurance works.</p><p> If your home is covered against fire damage for $300,000, the insurance company won&rsquo;t set aside $300,000 specifically for your home.</p><p> Their actuarial tables suggest that the risk of loss is much less than 100%. So they&rsquo;ll only set aside a fraction of that amount.</p><p> And admittedly, the risk of a 100% loss in the banking system is almost zero. They don&rsquo;t need anywhere near $13 trillion to properly insure it.</p><h3> But even the FDIC itself acknowledges that their insurance fund is totally insufficient.</h3><p> <br/> For starters, the fund doesn&rsquo;t come close to meeting the minimum legal reserve requirement that was established by law following the Global Financial Crisis several years ago.</p><p> Even more, the FDIC states in its own report that they need TWICE the current reserve balance as &ldquo;the minimum level needed to withstand future crises of the magnitude of past crises.&rdquo;</p><p> Bottom line, the FDIC has stated in black and white that they are not equipped to deal with another bank crisis.</p><p> This is where the government is supposed to come in, with an explicit guarantee to bail out the banks.</p><p> The real irony, of course, is that the government doesn&rsquo;t have any of its own money. They only have your money. Taxpayer money.</p><p> So in essence, the government is guaranteeing your bank deposit with your own money. It&rsquo;s mind boggling.</p><p> The larger problem is that the government hasn&rsquo;t done a good job hanging on to any of your money.</p><p> With the Treasury Department&rsquo;s financial statements showing the US government&rsquo;s net worth at negative $60 trillion, Uncle Sam is in no position to bail anyone out.</p><p> Deposit insurance may have been a well intended idea. But the hard facts show that this blanket guarantee of bank safety is ultimately a ruse.</p><h3> None of the institutions involved has the financial resources to back up their promises.</h3><p> <br/> So instead of blindly depositing money in a dangerously illiquid banking system and expecting an insolvent government and undercapitalized insurance fund to fix everything, a rational person ought to consider other options.</p><p> There are other jurisdictions in the world (like Norway) where the banks are far more liquid and more capitalized, backed up by well-capitalized insurance funds or governments with minimal net debt.</p><p> Holding physical cash is an even easier option to reduce this banking system risk; just make sure to avoid high-denomination notes like 500 euros or $100 bills.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 18:08:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 18:08:37.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_tvhKmYG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/negative-interest-rates-in-the-us-just-ask-the-fdic/\", \"post_id\": \"9442\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 18:08:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 18:08:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"negative-interest-rates-in-the-us-just-ask-the-fdic\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9439\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4519\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Make-End-Of-Life-Planning-Easier.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"368\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456408800,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

These are negative emotions that stop us from learning. When that&rsquo;s the case, many regular methods don&rsquo;t work, like:</p><li> <strong>  Leading by example </strong></li><li> <strong>  Asking them why they didn&rsquo;t </strong> <br/>  </li><p> When you want them to be open for new ways to please customers, reframing is the better option.

The feeling of a free-flowing conversation is missed and not all questions are asked that should have been. Participants walk away feeling that there is no sense in pursuing the matter further. For businesspeople the sale is lost, and for those interviewing, the new job is lost.</p><h3> The conversation is not over until all pressing questions have been answered</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  My Story </strong></p><p> A colleague recommended that I attend an introductory webinar for a particular service. The topic held interest so I agreed to participate. However, as the hour progressed, my interest declined. In all honesty, I was just listening as there were several others on the line. Seeking commonality, it didn&rsquo;t sound as if there was much to be found.</p><p> Afterward, I sent an email to the organizer to skip the next day telephone call. I didn&rsquo;t want to waste her time. Ironically, she never received the email. Unexpectedly, my phone rang. &ldquo;Beth&rdquo; and I had one of the most energizing conversations I&rsquo;ve had in a while.</p><p> It turned out that we have a similar sales background and share some of the same types of corporate horror stories. In fact, we are both on a mission to right some of those wrongs for younger women. Needless to say, I saw numerous ways in which we would both benefit by joining forces.</p><p> <strong>  Your Story </strong></p><p> Answers to the following questions may lend light on how to better handle future quick decisions.</p><li> <strong>  Are you quick to dismiss new associations? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Do you occasionally feel bad about a hasty decision? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Most importantly, what triggered the quick decision to decline the offer? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> 1. Filters</h3><p> <br/> Our filters are necessary for discerning where to stop in our tracks. However, sometimes they are too finely tuned. It&rsquo;s best to have a follow-up discussion to be certain nothing was missed.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I meant to ask&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> 2. Missing Elements</h3><p> <br/> If you find yourself wondering why something wasn&rsquo;t addressed, be certain to ask. Leaving facts out of a conversation can either be intentional or due to not recognizing the importance. Either way you have both a need and the right to know the answer.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;What is your take on&hellip;?&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> 3. Recognize Clues</h3><p> <br/> Clues are found in body language, posture, facial expressions and the show of interest in you. Any change in this is a sign that the other party has a question. Stop immediately to ask what&rsquo;s on their mind.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Do you have a question?&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> 4. Connect Personally</h3><p> <br/> Exchange personal stories to develop a bond.

It&rsquo;s staring at you both, testing you, but neither one of you wants to be the first to acknowledge it.</p><p> Passively, one of you succumbs to the discomfort and picks up the credit card bill that is sitting on the top of the pile.</p><h3> And it begins&hellip;.</h3><p> <br/> What could have been a perfectly civil conversation begins with a gasp or growl, followed by a borage of questions and attacks.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;How is our credit card bill so high again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were going to charge that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where do you think we&rsquo;re going to get the money to pay for this?&rdquo; &ldquo;You promised you were going to cut back going out to lunch this month.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> What comes next is a series of defensive maneuvers and blame-shifting that eventually leads to some pretty impressive shouting or, for those of you who didn&rsquo;t grow up in a loud Italian family like me, piercing angry eye stare-downs that basically conveys the same message: I&rsquo;m really mad about the finances and I&rsquo;m taking it out on you right now.</p><p> What if I told you that money conversations didn&rsquo;t have to go this way? What if there was a way to stop having the same money arguments over and over again?</p><p> There is.</p><p> Money can fuel some pretty passionate responses and reactions, which is why the first step toward avoiding money arguments is to stop being reactive and start planning for proactive money conversations instead.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how.</p><h3> Get on the same page</h3><p> <br/> Schedule time for both of you to talk uninterrupted about the household finances. I recommend creating an agenda together on what you want to cover and accomplish during your planned talk. This will help you keep your conversation focused and productive.</p><li> <strong>  Review the state of the finances so both of you know exactly what your money situation is. </strong> Is debt an issue? Not enough savings? Don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re on track to meet your goals? Having both of you aware and involved will help keep you aligned.</li><li> <strong>  Speaking of goals, you should have specific ones for your money. </strong> How much are you trying to save and for what purpose? Are you buying a new home, starting a business, growing your family or simply trying to build your rainy day fund? Target specific amounts you&rsquo;d like to stash away and assign a time period for building up the savings for each goal.</li><li> <strong>  Discuss roles and responsibilities for managing the finances, such as paying bills, saving, monitoring, etc. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Share what you think is working and what could be working better (or really isn&rsquo;t working at all). </strong></li><li> <strong>  Agree how you&rsquo;ll communicate and work together going forward (perhaps preparing ahead of time before coming to meetings / money talks. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> You may have this particular conversation a few times before you&rsquo;re finally on the same page. The real point of this conversation is to lay it all out on the table, explore the finances together and hash out anything that needs to be addressed so that it doesn&rsquo;t continue to cause arguments in the future.</p><h3> Schedule regular money talks</h3><p> <br/> From here, keep communication open by continuing to schedule time to talk about money. Scheduling is key, because it isn&rsquo;t a reaction to someone or something. Instead, it&rsquo;s a commitment you&rsquo;re both making to stay present with the finances.</p><p> Maintaining a monthly budget together is a great way to keep each other accountable and engaged in the process. Proactively planning on how much you&rsquo;ll save, what you need to cover your regular expenses, and allocating a certain amount of funds for undefined discretionary purchases helps to prevent any surprises on your credit card statement and anyone from being caught off guard.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t point fingers</h3><p> <br/> Finger pointing won&rsquo;t get you anywhere when it comes to actually making progress with your money.</p><p> In my experience, it may be better to avoid &ldquo;you&rdquo; comments altogether and opt for the &ldquo;we,&rdquo; because your money story includes both of you after all. So rather than saying, &ldquo;You always spend too much going out to eat during the week.&rdquo; A better way to address this particular issue (during your scheduled regular money talks) is to say, &ldquo;We continue to spend more than we allocated on going out to eat. Are there any ways we can limit or better track these expenses? Or should we cut back on another area instead so it balances out?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Remember, it&rsquo;s about resolving the finances together, not attacking one another. </strong></p><h3> Give praise</h3><p> <br/> Kind, positive affirmations go a long way, especially after a history of arguments and criticisms. Be supportive of each other and give praise when praise is do. Acknowledge the other person for their contributions to household finances. Thank your wife for paying the bills. Praise your husband when he opts to pay more towards the car payment instead of using the discretionary money on himself.</p><p> Help make each other feel good and appreciated when it comes to money. It&rsquo;s not easy and you both deserve affirmations for the effort, intention and commitment you&rsquo;re putting in to make it a more positive experience for both of you.</p><p> When you make a choice as a couple to start communicating about money, you&rsquo;re really choosing to work through and resolve the issues that activated your arguments in the first place.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re just starting out on your money journey together, the  <u>  Newlywed Money Bootcamp </u>  may be a great place to begin your financial future.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 20:18:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 20:18:32.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_1PqIteI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-stop-arguing-about-money-for-good/\", \"post_id\": \"9447\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 20:18:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 20:18:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-stop-arguing-about-money-for-good\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9446\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4522\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-To-Stop-Arguing-About-Money-\\u2013-For-Good.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"652\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456407000,"author_id":330,"chart_url":""}

The U.S. economy is far from being a proxy for oil, with mining and energy making up slightly less than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=51&amp;step=1#reqid=51&amp;step=51&amp;isuri=1&amp;5114=a&amp;5102=5\" target=\"_blank\">   3%  </a> </u>  of the economy.  Energy companies are over-represented in the S&amp;P 500 index relative to the overall economy but their weight in the index is  <u>  <a href=\"http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   less than 7%  </a> </u> . Adding the Materials sector still leaves you less than 10%.</p><p> Several commentators have noted that, if anything, low oil prices should only help consumers, and therefore boost consumption related sectors which make up most of the stock market. However, we have not yet seen  <u>  <a href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PCE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   consumption  </a> </u>  markedly pick up as a result of lower gas prices. At best, given the boom in shale energy in the U.S. over the past few years, and the subsequent pullback as oil prices plummet, the net effect would simply be neutral. Yet this has not been the case.</p><h3> Weak global demand and elevated volatility</h3><p> <br/> The most obvious answer appears to be a fall-off in global growth, reducing demand for crude oil while also reducing earnings for American companies that have a large number of customers abroad (and make up a significant portion of the stock market in terms of capitalization).</p><p> Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, was the latest to explore this issue. In a recent blog  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2016/02/19-stocks-and-oil-prices\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post  </a> </u> , Bernanke investigated the hypothesis that underlying changes in aggregate global demand explain the oil-stocks relationship. He uses the premise that commodity prices (other than oil), long-term interest rates, and the dollar are likely to be sensitive to investors&rsquo; perceptions of global demand, as opposed to just changes in oil supply. As an example, he notes that when a change in the price of oil is accompanied by a similar change in the price of copper, this model concludes that both are responding primarily to a common global demand factor.</p><p> However, he finds that only 40-45 percent of the decline in oil prices since June 2014 can be explained by a slowdown in aggregate global demand. This clearly does not complete the entire story.</p><p> Bernanke then investigates the possibility that investors retreat from commodities as well as stocks during periods of high uncertainty and risk aversion. Shocks to volatility may be another reason for the observed tendency of stocks and oil prices to move together. Yet, adding this component still did not completely explain the lockstep movement, and he concludes:</p><p> &ldquo;The tendency of stocks and oil prices to move together is not a new development; it goes back nearly five years (the limits of our sample) and probably more. Much of this positive correlation can be explained by the tendency of stocks and oil prices to react in the same direction to common factors, including changes in aggregate demand and in overall uncertainty and risk aversion. However, even accounting for these factors, the residual correlation is close to zero, not negative as we would expect if it were capturing only beneficial supply shocks.</p><p> There are several other explanations that could be investigated: for example, the possibility that declines in oil prices, even if initially caused by higher supply, affect global financial conditions by damaging the creditworthiness of oil-producing companies or countries. This topic is one well worth revisiting.&rdquo;</p><p> In this post we dig a little deeper into his final point. Specifically, as to how the decline in oil prices are affecting oil-producing countries, and how this may be a proximal cause for the tandem movement in stocks and oil prices.</p><h3> A shortage of petrodollars</h3><p> <br/> Petrodollars are essentially the U.S. dollars earned by oil-exporting nations for selling their oil on the global market. After the financial crisis, as oil prices recovered to more than $100 a barrel (by 2011), the major oil-exporting nations accumulated billions of dollars in reserves, swelling the coffers of their respective sovereign wealth funds (SWFs).  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SWFs  </a> </u>  are essentially state-owned investment funds that typically prefer returns over liquidity, and thus have a higher risk tolerance than traditional foreign exchange reserves.</p><p> As of December 2015,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   56 percent  </a> </u>  of the $7.2 trillion in SWFs were oil and gas related. Eighteen of the top thirty SWFs have their coffers filled with revenues from oil and gas. The top five &ndash; four of which are oil related &ndash; have $3.6 trillion between them (shown below).</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWF-top-5-Dec-2015.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"SWF - top 5 - Dec 2015\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWF-top-5-Dec-2015.png\"/> </a></p><a href=\"http://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Source</a>: Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute.Data as of December 2015. * &ndash; Oil and gas SWFs.<br/> <p> SWFs in turn invested their petrodollars across the globe in a variety of assets, including U.S./emerging market debt and global stocks. According to the Global Macro Credit team at RBS, during the boom years oil-exporting nations found themselves needing to invest $700-$800 billion a year, net of extraction costs ( <u>  <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/10/12/2141989/the-commodity-credit-feedback-loop/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   via FT Alphaville  </a> </u> ). Just to get a sense of scale, petrodollar investments across the globe during the boom years of 2010-2014 were of  <u>  <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/10/07/2141691/on-the-actual-reality-of-no-more-petrodollars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   similar size  </a> </u>  to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Quantitative Easing (QE) programs. Now it is reversing, in addition to the fact that the Fed ended QE in October 2014 and is on a path of tightening.</p><p> As we discussed on top, plunging oil prices was initially thought to be expansionary, especially for consumers in the U.S. and Europe. However, Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman  <u>  <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/oil-goes-nonlinear/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;_r=2\" target=\"_blank\">   makes  </a> </u>  an important point on the non-linearity of plunging oil prices. While a 10-20 percent decline in prices (or slightly more) might indeed prove to work in the conventional way, a 70 percent decline really constrains producers.</p><p> In other words, oil falling from above $100 a barrel to about $60 a barrel has less of an impact on the balance sheets of oil-producers than when oil prices are cut in half from $60 to $30 a barrel. The level of oil prices may matter more than the actual percentage decline.</p><h3> Uncharted waters for Norway</h3><p> <br/> The crash in oil prices has clearly stung Norway, as economic growth has stalled. The nation is now expected to make its first-ever withdrawals from its SWF &ndash; the largest in the world &ndash; in 2016. In October the government  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-18/norway-central-bank-chief-warns-on-oil-wealth-as-coffers-raided\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unveiled  </a> </u>  a budget that uses a record amount of oil wealth to support growth, while withdrawing $570 million from its SWF. Since then, oil has been cut by a third, dropping into the low $30s. Just this past week, Oeystein Olsen, governor of Norway&rsquo;s central bank, said the withdrawal may have ballooned to $9 billion.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Norway-SWF-inflows-outflows.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Norway SWF inflows-outflows\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Norway-SWF-inflows-outflows.png\"/> </a></p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-18/norway-central-bank-chief-warns-on-oil-wealth-as-coffers-raided\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Source</a>: Norges Bank, Norges Bank Investment Management via Bloomberg<br/> <p> As the nation continues to get buffeted by low oil prices, the central bank is making ever more purchases to keep its currency stable. The bank  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/norway-to-buy-record-amount-of-kroner-as-oil-price-crash-stings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   increased  </a> </u>  its purchases of the krone in February, to $104 million a day, from $58 million a day in December. Note that the bank only started purchasing kroner for the first time back in October 2014, just after oil started its downward slide.</p><h3> Saudi Arabia slammed</h3><p> <br/> The case of Saudi Arabia is even more stark, and best encapsulated by the free-fall in reserves.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Saudi-Arabia-reserves-Dec-2015.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Saudi Arabia reserves - Dec 2015\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Saudi-Arabia-reserves-Dec-2015.png\"/> </a></p><a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/saudi-arabia/foreign-exchange-reserves\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Source</a>: Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency via TradingEconomics.com<br/> <p> The country still has seemingly formidable reserves but as the chart shows, its falling fast. In the eighteen months leading up to December 2015, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s reserves fell from $746 billion to $613 billion. In an October report, the IMF  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2015/mcd/eng/pdf/menap1015.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   predicted  </a> </u>  that Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s cash reserves will be depleted in five years if oil prices stay low. At the time oil was close to $50 a barrel.</p><p> The problem is that Saudi Arabia is a large  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/03/biggest-cash-issue-for-saudi-arabia-goes-beyond-oil.html\" target=\"_blank\">   welfare state  </a> </u> , with the population dependent on direct and indirect government subsidies. Last February (2015), the newly crowned King Salman  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/world/middleeast/saudi-king-unleashes-a-torrent-as-bonuses-flow-to-the-masses.html\" target=\"_blank\">   handed out $32 billion  </a> </u>  to celebrate his coronation. If oil prices stay low, the country will be faced with the choice of drastic austerity, and severe budget cuts.</p><p> In any case, it is unlikely that they will be using their SWF to continue buying global assets &ndash; in fact, the opposite is likely.</p><h3> From net liquidity provider to draining liquidity</h3><p> <br/> Oil-based SWFs, including UAE, Qatar and Russia, have also started to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-08/wealth-funds-from-oslo-to-riyadh-raid-coffers-to-offset-oil-drop\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   liquidate  </a> </u>  investments as they try to bridge the gap between low revenues and high fiscal spending.

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a London-based strategist at J.P.

In terms of regional allocation, they appear overweight Europe, Middle East and Africa and Developed Asia and underweight North America and Emerging Asia.&rdquo;  </p><p> Just in 2016, we have seen financial stocks in the U.S. and Europe significantly under-performing the broad-based indices. Interestingly, while oil-producers have been  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-14/unexpected-twist-oil-exporters-are-buying-treasurys-while-they-liquidate-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   net sellers  </a> </u>  of equities, corporate and agency debt, they have been cumulative buyers of U.S. treasury securities. This puts even further downward pressure on the yield curve, in addition to some of the other factors we discussed in an earlier  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/are-higher-interest-rates-inevitable/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post  </a> </u> .</p><p> It is still an open question as to the medium/long-term impact of SWFs selling risky assets across the globe. Oil-based SWF assets are not large relative to the massive assets held by pension funds, endowments, insurers and individuals. If you estimate that approximately 60 percent of oil-based SWF wealth is held in global equities, say $2.4 trillion (60% of $4 trillion), this is only 3.5 percent of global stock market capitalization (about $69 trillion).</p><p> Nevertheless, the more important effect may be that a marginal buyer of global risk assets is now a seller. The reversal of petrodollar flows may matter most in terms of market sentiment over the short-term, especially if oil prices continue to remain at depressed levels between $30-$40 a barrel.</p> ","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 20:30:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 20:30:53.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_LbIw0TF.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-are-stocks-and-oil-prices-moving-in-tandem/\", \"post_id\": \"9448\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 20:30:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 20:30:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-are-stocks-and-oil-prices-moving-in-tandem\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9446\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4523\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-To-Stop-Arguing-About-Money-\\u2013-For-Good.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"817\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456426800,"author_id":158,"chart_url":""}

Which Is More Important in Driving Great Customer Experiences?","link":"heart-or-head-first-which-is-more-important-in-driving-great-customer-experiences","source_link":null,"content":"<p> One of my Fathers most memorable quotes when I was a young boy was &lsquo;engage your brain before opening your mouth!&rsquo; &ndash; I am unlikely to be the only adult who was given this type of advice in their youth! Talking from the heart; saying what I want to say; saying what I believe in; has always been hard-wired in to the way my brain works. There are those who will not always agree with what comes out of our mouths (my Dad included!) &ndash; that is a healthy certainty. However, I have always believed that as long as I talk from the heart; as long as I do what I believe to be the &lsquo;right thing&rsquo;, then my head and heart will work harmoniously together.During my working life, this principle has been challenged on many occasions. Heartfelt passion; a distinct belief in something; is often misconstrued by those who do not feel the same about a subject. I have been described as being &rsquo;emotionally immature&rsquo; by a previous boss of mine &ndash; this boss used this description as he could not understand why I was making a decision based on my principles &ndash; based on my beliefs &ndash; a decision led from the heart.In the corporate world, too often we &ndash; people &ndash; are expected to make decisions using our heads and our heads alone. Our heads are filled up with rules and regulations that must be adhered to. Whilst many rules and regulations are fundamentally necessary, the intense drive to do everything based on &lsquo;what the head says&rsquo; leads to many decisions being made by people whose &lsquo;hearts&rsquo; strongly disagree with the decision.Let me give you an example &ndash; have you ever interacted with an employee of an organisation who has said something along the lines of: <strong>  I completely agree with you &ndash; I have no idea why we do things this way, but that is how things have always been done! </strong> So many organisations are unable to enable their people to &lsquo;do what is right&rsquo; &ndash; to EMPOWER them; rather than just do what it says in the rule book. Empowering people to use their hearts AND their heads, can have an immensely powerful effect on not just the employee &ndash; it also has an immense effect on the experience that customers will have in interacting with them. <strong>  Empowerment is based on the idea that giving employees skills, resources, authority, opportunity, motivation, as well holding them responsible and accountable for outcomes of their actions, will contribute to their competence and satisfaction. </strong> This important definition of a word that business leaders often find difficult to comprehend, brings to life why understanding how to balance the heart and the head is so critical. I strongly believe that if you allow people to use both (not necessarily in equal balance), then the experiences that they will deliver to all customers (internal and external) will be greatly improved. To describe what I mean, allow me to share two examples with you.The man seated at the very front of this picture is Kingdom Thenga. Kingdom is co-owner of a wonderful restaurant in my home city &ndash; Chester. Last year, I awarded this particular restaurant &ndash; at the hollows &ndash; the highest score to date in my independent  <u>  Customer Experience Review </u>  process. You can read the full review  <u>  <a href=\"https://ijgolding.com/2015/08/20/at-the-hollows-customer-experience-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .Last weekend, Naomi and I took two of our dearest friends, Steve and Sasha, to the restaurant for the first time. Steve has owned his own bar and restaurant in the past and is a real stickler for Customer Experience. I was fascinated to see if</p><li> the experience would be as good as the first time (when I wrote my review)</li><li> Steve and Sasha would feel the same way Naomi and I did</li>I can confirm that in both cases &ndash; we were not disappointed. The overall experience was just as good as the first time &ndash; if not even better. However, the purpose of this blog post is not to re-write the review I have already written. The reason why I am mentioning this fabulous restaurant again is in context with the title of the post.During our visit to &lsquo;at the hollows&rsquo;, Kingdom was ever-present. Seamlessly interacting with colleagues and customers, he attended to his restaurant in the same way that a green fingered horticulturist attends to their land. Seemingly as happy clearing tables as he was sharing a drink with regulars, it was unbelievably apparent that Kingdom Thenga is a man who LOVES what he does.I will regularly say to people that Customer Experience is &lsquo;in your heart&rsquo; &ndash; Kingdom epitomises that theory. In fact, when Steve and I told him what we thought of him and his restaurant, Kingdom admitted that his principal motivation for doing what he does is not &lsquo;to make money&rsquo;. &lsquo;This is my passion&rsquo;, Kingdom said. Monetary reward is not the motivation. The reality is that &lsquo;at the hollows&rsquo; will be a successful thriving business making lots of money for many many years whilst this man  continues to pour his heart and his head into doing what he believes in.Now for my second example &ndash; another food themed one. At first glance, you may wonder why I am sharing a picture of an empty table in a restaurant! If you look past the table to the kitchen, you can just about make out a person wearing a hairnet. This picture was taken last week inside a Pizza Express restaurant. The person in the hairnet is the restaurant manager. At the point I took the photo, she had donned an apron (as well as the hairnet), to help her pizza chefs. Even though the restaurant was not full, they were struggling to get orders out to customers quickly enough.We have visited this Pizza Express many times &ndash; I have noticed this manager before. Unlike Kingdom, she does not own her restaurant. This lady is an employee of a large business. However, every single time I have observed her at work, she has been as engaged and connected to what she is doing &ndash; to her staff and her customers &ndash; as any restaurant manager I have ever seen.To see her only to willing to jump straight into the kitchen to help out was incredibly refreshing &ndash; she could have seen this as something beneath her &ndash; many managers would have remained on the shop floor &lsquo;barking orders&rsquo;. Not this lady. I believe that she used her heart AND her head to do what was right.The result of her actions was customers getting their Pizzas on time and her team remaining happy and in control. Most customers would not have even noticed &ndash; an even greater reflection of her ability as a leader. If she simply stuck to &lsquo;the head&rsquo;, I think it is unlikely that she would have done what she did &ndash; I have never observed this happening before &ndash; even when the restaurant has been busier and service slower.I will be featuring an exclusive interview with Joseph in an upcoming blog post &ndash; watch out for it!So when it comes to driving great Customer Experiences, which is more important &ndash; the heart or the head? Joseph Michelli is perhaps one of the longest standing and most inspiring Customer Experience Professionals in the world An American psychologist, speaker, author, and radio personality, Joseph started his career as a psychologist in 1988 and began writing business books in 2004, including <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Starbucks_Experience_5_Principles_fo.html?id=ZP0kg7tKXDAC&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> The Starbucks Experience</a>. I recently asked Joseph this very question &ndash; which is more important, the heart or the head? The answer &ndash; as far as he is concerned &ndash; is that Customer Experience is more about the HEART than the head. If you can get people to BELIEVE that they are part of something great, you will enable their hearts to be &lsquo;revved up&rsquo; to serve people in the best way possible.So there you have it &ndash; in the Customer Experience battle of heart versus head&hellip;.. heart wins&hellip;&hellip; although we must always ensure that we are engaging our heads to use what the heart tells us to be as effective as possible (thanks Dad!).","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 20:44:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 20:44:24.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_fS8drA4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/heart-or-head-first-which-is-more-important-in-driving-great-customer-experiences/\", \"post_id\": \"9449\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 20:44:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 20:44:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"heart-or-head-first-which-is-more-important-in-driving-great-customer-experiences\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9446\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4524\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-To-Stop-Arguing-About-Money-\\u2013-For-Good.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"479\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456423200,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4359,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Top Ten Trends in Banking Innovation","link":"the-top-ten-trends-in-banking-innovation","source_link":null,"content":"<p> We had two Financial Services Club meetings on the same night this week: one in London where Chief Executive of the Payments Council Maurice Cleaves talked about the landscape future for UK payments markets; and one in Warsaw where Lukas Dzuroska presented the top ten trends tracked in research by EFMA over the past year.  I was in the Polish meeting, as it was also the first launch meeting for ValueWeb, and was intrigued to hear to the EFMA research.Littered with global examples, EFMA have been running an awards program with Accenture for a few years now, to recognise global banking innovation.  The examples included many of my favourites &ndash; Commonwealth Bank of Australia, DBS (Singapore), mBank (Poland), Deniz Bank (Turkey), Standard Bank (South Africa) and more &ndash; and showed ten key trends emerging in the past year, of how banks are absorbing innovation.</p><h3> #10: Data Monetization</h3>Banks are recognising that their data analytics can leverage market opportunity, for example NedBank in South Africa offering merchants far more business insights through market intelligence services.  Customers are willing to pay for this, and the banks that offer such services are more sticky.<h3> #9: Social Value Chain</h3>Banks don&rsquo;t need to do all the work as customer can, and they want to.  Many banks are engaging customers in crowd sourcing ideas, with Widiba (Italy) picked as a great example.  Widiba asked customers to design the features of the next generation bank which have now been delivered.<h3> #8: Robot force</h3>There are a few gimmicky robot services out there, particular in Japan where robots replaced tellers (I thought we had done the same in the UK until the teller moved and I realised then they were human), but it&rsquo;s not just robo-advisors that are taking off. After all, take a look at UBS who offer a real-time portfolio analytics services on a personalised basis to all of their high net worth clients through IBM&rsquo;s Watson (DBS do the same).<h3> #7: The Banking of Things (BoT)</h3>We know the Internet of Things (IoT) is coming, and it will need BoT based upon the ValueWeb to support it, but things are already emerging in this space.  US Bank offers a link to light bulbs to flash you when something is happening on your account whilst Bradesco offers a connection between your car and your bank account.  But the example that Lukas showed was ASB from New Zealand who have created a fun way to inform children about money called Clever Kash.  <strong> See the video above.</strong><h3> #6: Intermediate Everything</h3>It&rsquo;s funny how I&rsquo;ve about banks being disintermediated since the 1990s and yet they&rsquo;re still here and they&rsquo;re now bigger.  I don&rsquo;t believe banks will be disintermediated or, as we now call it, unbundled.  Banks instead are reintermediating and <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2016/02/fintech-2-0-the-great-rebundling.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  rebundling everything </a></u> and this trend proves it.  There are various examples of this, specifically the idea of predictive analytics and partnering to remind you that you that it&rsquo;s your partner&rsquo;s birthday today, for example.  The idea here &ndash; a stretch for most banks &ndash; is that the bank will not only know it&rsquo;s their birthday, but will tell you what you brought them for Christmas and for last year&rsquo;s present, and suggest things they might like this year.  I can&rsquo;t believe this one right now, but apparently Alfa Bank (Russia), CBA (Australia), Santander (Spain) and Caixa (Brazil) are already well on the road to making this happen.<h3> #5: Distributed Payments</h3>How about banking as a status symbol? Show off my contactless bracelet (La Caixa, Spain), biometric tracker (RBC Canada and HBOS UK), wearable suit (Heritage Bank, Australia), wearable everything (Barclays UK) and more.  Hmmm &hellip; just seems to me that I can pay for something with just the flick of finger these days.<a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tech-iphone-5s-touch-id.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"tech-iphone-5s-touch-id\" height=\"353\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tech-iphone-5s-touch-id.jpg\" width=\"515\"/></a><h3> #4: Talking Transactions</h3>We used to have boring transactional statements, but many banks are bringing transactions alive by integrating features and apps with other plug and play services, like Google Maps, Facebook and Instagram.  An example of brining things to life is the Moven app, which alerts the user when they&rsquo;re spending and getting above their budget limits by breaking the glass on their phone.<a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Moven1.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Moven1\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Moven1.jpg \"/></a><h3> #3: Love those SMEs</h3>SME &ndash; Small to Medium Enterprises or, if you prefer, small companies &ndash; have been relatively unloved by banks in the past.  They are high risk until established and, even then, unless they get to a certain size &ndash; more than $100 million revenues &ndash; they can cause credit risk concerns.  Those concerns can be overcome by partnering with the new mentors like Funding Circle or by doing things like the Kumsal services from Deniz Bank, Turkey.  This is a platform that supports small businesses gain digital reach by offering a comprehensive suite of support from digital marketing to communications to operations to an overall online presence.<h3> #2: Non-stop, Always On</h3>The 24*7 bank is here, and it doesn&rsquo;t cut the mustard to be 9 till 5 anymore.  Equally, some banks are becoming more than just 24*7 by offshoring, with banks such as Standard Bank, South Africa, offering a single dashboard to let relationship managers connect with their clients via any media the client prefers to use including WeChat, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Whatsapp, etc.<h3> #1: Everything is personal</h3>I like this one as I&rsquo;ve talked 1:1 Marketing since the 1990s, but it&rsquo;s finally happening, with one-size fits all only applying to scarves these days.  The fact is that we now have a fully enabled digital customer platform where back office cloud and analytics can deliver real-time experiences through APIs anywhere, anytime.  The example EFMA chose for this category is Idea Bank, Poland, who offer an entire financial ecosystem for their clients from cloud-based internet banking to an Uber-styled ATM.<img alt=\"\" height=\"636\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-24-at-1.18.54-PM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/>click to watchIdea Bank also won the award for best innovation at BAI Retail Delivery last year LINK and this is the most notable feature of both the EFMA and BAI Awards. Both focus upon innovation and both give the most awards to two countries: Turkey, Italy and Poland.<a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Turkey.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Turkey\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Turkey.jpg \"/></a>EFMA had 224 shortlisted innovations from Turkish banks in 2015, 203 from Italian Banks and 141 from Polish banks. A near fourth place is Spain with 134 nominations.  Now you could say that this is because EFMA are European, but <u> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/10/the-most-innovative-banks-of-2015.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  BAI </a></u> had major placements for Turkish and Polish banks.You may say that this is because these are the banks that enter these awards, but you would be wrong.  It is because these banks are launching new, mobile first services, based upon fit for purpose back office systems implemented in the last few years.  Unfortunately, most US, UK and large banks of developed economises look positively straight jacketed by comparison.","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-24 21:20:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-24 21:20:39.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_c60xZS7.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-top-ten-trends-in-banking-innovation/\", \"post_id\": \"9452\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-24 21:20:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-24 21:20:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-top-ten-trends-in-banking-innovation\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9450\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4525\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Top-Ten-Trends-in-Banking-Innovation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"895\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456398000,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}

The research paper  is titled &ldquo; <a href=\"http://gsm.ucdavis.edu/research/boys-will-be-boys-gender-overconfidence-and-common-stock-investment\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Boys Will Be Boys: Gender Overconfidence and Common Stock Investment  </u>  . </a> &rdquo;</p><p> Odean&rsquo;s study was recently mentioned in a U.S. News article,  <u>  Are Women Better Investors Than Men? </u> , which answers its own question by stating that, &ldquo;[w]omen outperform relative to men&rdquo; in investing.</p><p> The article goes on to quote Abigial Sussman, assistant professor at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business and member of the Morningstar Behavioral Science Advisory Board as saying that &ldquo;men trade more excessively than women [attributable to overconfidence]&hellip; and this hurts portfolio returns relative to a lower level of active trading.&rdquo;</p><p> Other quotes in U.S News piece, some of which might not feel good to some male egos, include the following:</p><p> &ldquo;Women tend to be calmer, possess a longer-term outlook, do more research on their investments and remain steady under pressure.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Men can view trading and investing as a game rather than as a business. They are more likely to seek out and trade the hot stock tip and take poorly planned trades.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Women are more likely to give their investments time to grow. This is important because checking returns and acting on short-term fluctuations in stock performance leads to negative outcomes.&rdquo;</p><p> Research from Vanguard that looked at the trading of 2.7 million IRA investors seems to back this all up. It found that &ldquo;men were more likely to trade than women during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and they did so at the wrong times.&rdquo; The study also found that &ldquo;men were much more likely to sell stock at market lows.&rdquo;</p><p> The &ldquo;Boys Will Be Boys&rdquo; paper that I mentioned above, also analyzed investor returns by looking at the performance of over 35,000 brokerage accounts.</p><h3> What did it find?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Men trade more than women&hellip;&rdquo; which &ldquo;reduces men&rsquo;s net returns by 2.65% a year&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> And that:</p><p> &ldquo;Overconfidence can lead men to take on too much risk and&hellip; tend to believe their interpretation of news and market movement is sound&hellip; [even when] this isn&rsquo;t as true as they may think.&rdquo;</p><h3> Are these sorts of findings at the root of Christine Lagarde&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lehman Sisters&rdquo; quote?</h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t know specifically, but I am reminded of the culture at Lehman Brothers heading into the financial crisis. I still keep on my desk a cube that was handed out to all Lehman employees to remind everyone of Lehman&rsquo;s &ldquo;operating principles&rdquo; (see below).</p><p> <a href=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh1-e1456157267551.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Leh1\" src=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh1-e1456157267551.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\"/> </a> <br/> <a href=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh2-e1456157309378.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Leh2\" src=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh2-e1456157309378.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\"/> </a></p><p> <a href=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh12-e1456163770568.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"leh1\" src=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh12-e1456163770568.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\"/> </a> <br/> <a href=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh-e1456157132759.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Leh\" src=\"https://prestonmcswain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/leh-e1456157132759.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\"/> </a></p><p> In my time at Lehman, including at a few meetings I attended with Lehman CEO Dick Fuld, I found that &ldquo;the culture&rdquo; in parts of the firm was &ldquo;lead with your chin&rdquo; and boys&rsquo; clubby.</p><p> Was that male-dominated environment prone to taking on too much dangerous risk and in contravention of the &ldquo;smart risk management&rdquo; goal on the Lehman cube?</p><h3> The fall of Lehman suggests maybe so.</h3><p> <br/> At a minimum, the cube reminds me daily about the dangers of overconfidence that are highlighted in Odean&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boys Will Be Boys&rdquo; research findings.</p><p> So, do I think Lagarde was correct in suggesting that Wall Street banks would have been in better shape in 2008 with more women in leadership positions?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> Do I think Wall Street banks would be better now with more women in leadership positions?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> And, do I think we men could be better investors by following the lead of more women?</p><p> Yes.</p><p> When I spoke at Harvard&rsquo;s Dynamic Women in Business Conference, I ended my remarks by saying, &ldquo;we need more women in finance and on Wall Street.&rdquo;</p><p> I will end this piece by adding only a few points to that</p><h3> !!!</h3>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-25 14:29:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-25 14:29:08.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_UoA2QUs.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/lehman-sisters-would-banks-be-better-if-more-were-run-by-women/\", \"post_id\": \"9453\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-25 14:29:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-25 14:29:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"lehman-sisters-would-banks-be-better-if-more-were-run-by-women\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9450\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4527\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Top-Ten-Trends-in-Banking-Innovation.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"908\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456482600,"author_id":389,"chart_url":""}

If you claim to be customer-obsessed, like I do, you celebrate and fulfill those types of requests immediately!!!</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;flip-side&rdquo; (forgive that term as it is a vestige of my days as a disc jockey when the 45 RPM was king &ndash; for those too young to know what a 45 RPM is &ndash; here is a  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record\" target=\"_blank\">  wikipedia link </a> ). Back to my client&rsquo;s request&hellip;</p><h3> 5 Things Service Professionals Should ALWAYS Say&hellip; <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Hello, my name is&hellip; </strong></li><p> All business is personal. Offering our name, gives customers an invitation to be in a personal interaction, not a detached business transaction. More importantly when we offer our name customers are more inclined to share theirs. As we become aware of a customer&rsquo;s name, we should use it respectfully and kindly. Dale Carnegie once suggested that the most pleasant sound is one&rsquo;s name used lovingly.</p><li> <strong>  Yes&hellip;and&hellip; </strong></li><p> I came upon this phrase while doing training in improv comedy. Imagine two actors entering an empty stage to create an improvisational scene based soley on a suggestion from the audience. Whenever one actor utters something or makes a gesture the other actor is given a &ldquo;gift on which the scene can be advanced.&rdquo; If one actor says &ldquo;it sure is cold out&rdquo; the other essentially says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &mdash; begins to shiver &ndash; AND adds something to the scene like &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you come over to my fire&rdquo; (both actors begin to warm their hands above the fire imagined by the second actor). When we assist customers we shouldn&rsquo;t be acting. However, we should be ADVANCING the relationship by embracing and building on the wants, needs, and desires of our customer.</p><li> <strong>  Have you considered&hellip; </strong></li><p> There are many alternatives for this particular phrase but it&rsquo;s essence is to continue to show and inform your customer other service/product possibilities beyond their initial inquiry. More negative sounding terms for this service behavior include &ldquo;cross-selling&rdquo; or &ldquo;adding on to the customer&rsquo;s ticket.&rdquo; As I think about this, I am not focused on the sale as much as facilitating customer exploration and discovery.</p><li> <strong>  Thank You! </strong></li><p> Momma told us we should use these &ldquo;magic words&rdquo; right along side &ldquo;please.&rdquo; In truth, customers often feel a lack of gratitude for having chosen to &ldquo;browse, spend time in a business or for even making a purchase.&rdquo; Be the company that says thank you to every customer, every time they visit you on or offline.</p><li> <strong>  I look forward to seeing/assisting you again soon. </strong></li><p> Give your customer a reason to come back! Talk about an upcoming promotion or encourage them to update you on how they liked something they bought today. But most importantly let them know you are eager to see them again and hopefully to be of assistance to them again in the future.</p><h3> Ok, that&rsquo;s the flip-side&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s up to you to post this information and other resource information to drive the service words you want your customer to hear&hellip;</p><p> For more key components to great service interactions, I hope you will consider picking up my book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.d2dbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Driven to Delight: Delivering World-Class Customer Experience the Mercedes-Benz Way  </a> </u> .</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-25 14:32:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-25 14:32:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_mhi0sJR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-things-service-professionals-should-always-say/\", \"post_id\": \"9455\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-25 14:32:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-25 14:32:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-things-service-professionals-should-always-say\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9454\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4528\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-Things-Service-Professionals-Should-ALWAYS-Say\\u2026.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"564\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456513200,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

When families only focus on hard assets &ndash; the money &ndash; they lose sight of their most important assets.</p><p> You have three asset types and only focusing on the money or tangible assets leaves a gaping hole. If you are not able to properly pass on all assets to your heirs, you end up with break downs in family communication, misunderstandings, legal problems and squandered wealth.</p><h3> Assets of Excellence</h3><p> <br/> When most people think of assets, they think of physical things&mdash;money, homes, cars, jewelry&mdash;but these objects are a poor replacement for a person&rsquo;s most valuable assets.</p><p> Your assets can be broken into three main categories:</p><li> <strong>  Character Assets: </strong> Your meaningful relationships, values, health, spirituality, heritage, purpose, talents, and plans for giving.</li><li> <strong>  Intellectual Assets: </strong> Your business systems, alliances, ideas, skills, traditions, and wisdom.</li><li> <strong>  Financial Assets: </strong> Your physical wealth and how to pass along money in a way that is meaningful and is not going to harm its recipients by making them dependent and unhappy. <br/>  </li><p> It is easy to pass along your financial assets. Simply set up a trust or foundation and they are distributed as you have instructed.</p><h3> But what about your character and intellectual assets?</h3><p> <br/> Often these assets are lost simply because there is not a structured way to identify them and pass them along. But there is a way to properly structure and create a meaningful legacy that takes into account your intellectual and character assets and may very well be the thing that preserves your financial assets.</p><p> When you look at the stats above, you'll see that 85% of failed wealth transfers are a direct result of not properly passing on intellectual and character assets and much of the remaining 15% could be solved by transferring these two asset types as well.</p><h3> What is a Meaning Legacy?</h3><p> <br/> Simply put, a Meaning Legacy preserves your life, lessons you&rsquo;ve learned along your journey and vision for the future as a guide to those you care about. It&rsquo;s not only about leaving behind something great after you have died. It&rsquo;s about living life in a way that will positively impact those you love right here, right now.</p><p> A Meaning Legacy gives your loved ones so much more than good memories; it creates a dialog, a family narrative that will serve as the foundation for their decisions, loyalty and love. <strong>  When a family is able to openly discuss important issues, have fun together, learn together and support each other, everything is better&mdash;from transferring wealth to family vacations. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-25 14:41:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-25 14:41:17.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_udF3e7P.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/transferring-wealth-the-right-way/\", \"post_id\": \"9457\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-25 14:41:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-25 14:41:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"transferring-wealth-the-right-way\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9456\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4529\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Transferring-Wealth-the-Right-Way.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"514\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456615800,"author_id":294,"chart_url":""}

We&rsquo;re curious why you started a company if you weren&rsquo;t going to trust anyone to do the job you hired them to do. Ironically you taking the time to spy on us is just as work-avoidant as what you&rsquo;re trying to catch us at! The Cold war is over. It&rsquo;s 2016 not 1984. This isn&rsquo;t wiki leaks, we&rsquo;re not Edward Snowden, and you&rsquo;re not in The Manchurian Candidate. The Hunt for Red October is over.</p><p>  &mdash; -</p><h3> <strong>  Dear Employee, </strong></h3><p> <br/> I saw you writing that letter on your computer. You&rsquo;re not supposed to be writing letters at work, unless it&rsquo;s on letterhead to one of our clients. I also saw you click the like button on Facebook for a video showing dogs who are scared of staircases. Watch your step.</p><p> &mdash; - </p><h3> <strong>  Why your torture plan will surely backfire </strong></h3><p> <br/> Using spyware on your employees is actually a form of mental torture. It&rsquo;s a modification on the panopticon, a structure developed in the 18th century by English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham to replace physical torture in prisons. The panopticon is a structure that allows inmates (employees) of an institution to be observed by a single watchman (boss) without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. The mere threat that someone could be watching you is what keeps you in your place. Benthem described the panopticon as &ldquo;a mill for grinding rogues honest.&rdquo;</p><p> &mdash; -</p><h3> <strong>  Maybe Try This Instead? </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  There&rsquo;s another concept called &ldquo;trust&rdquo; that has shown to be useful when creating successful work atmospheres. </strong> Rather than create a prisoner mentality in your employees, foster a self-leadership mentality so they feel they have the space to get their work done. If you need proof of concept look to Netflix, one of the fastest growing companies in the last ten years, who nurture an autonomous atmosphere where quality over quantity is rewarded. If that doesn&rsquo;t do it for you, research has shown that little breaks in the workday actually promote productivity. At the 90-minute mark on a single task our brains tend to lose focus. Little breaks spent checking Facebook or watching a funny YouTube video &ndash; as well as anything else that doesn&rsquo;t have to do with work &ndash; serves as a mental reboot.</p><p> <strong>  Side note: It is understandable, for the security of your company, if you need to use blocking software and block certain websites. </strong> That&rsquo;s different than spying.

I say Hooray!!  </strong> No, I&rsquo;m not a masochist or a pessimist, but I am an optimistic opportunist.  This is the perfect time to show your leadership prowess with your clients and many of your prospects. Some advisors only know how to shine when the markets are rocking and rolling. We say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t confuse brains with a bull market&rsquo;! Embrace the volatility and find reasons to reach out to your top twenty percent of clients at least. But if you have the time, reach deeper into your book of business and contact as many clients as you can. Clients want to know what&rsquo;s going on, IF you know what&rsquo;s going on and more importantly if you really care about them. <strong>  Now is your time to go above and beyond what most advisors do during these times. Rise and Shine! </strong></p><h3> Remember the wild stock market in the late 1990s?</h3><p> <br/> Think back to the crazy markets in the 1990s. The DJIA increased dramatically during the 1990s. The DJIA hit 1,000 for the first time in 1972. It took 15 years to double to 2000 by 1987. On the first day of the 1990s, it hit 2,800. It hit 10,000 in March 1999, more than tripling in just over 9 years. This is because people invested heavily in the stock market during the 1990s. The DJIA hit a peak of 11,722 in January 2000 and the two words we heard plenty about were irrational exuberance. For the trailing twelve months from March 1999 to March 2000, there were over 250 mutual funds with returns of over 100%.  Yes, you read that right. Tech stock returns were astronomical and it looked like there was no end to these insane returns. Imagine all the financial advisors hired in the middle years of the 1990s. They learned and believed that the stock market just keeps going up and up and every stock or fund they chose for their client was a winner. Even monkeys throwing darts at a Wall St. Journal could pick winning stocks. Yes, that was an actual article in the WSJ. Clients told their advisors that they didn&rsquo;t want to own bonds in their portfolios anymore. They suggested five HOT stocks they wanted because their barber or mechanic made a killing on them and they wanted similar returns. Asset allocation models that averaged ten to twelve percent annually over the last forty years lacked any luster compared to 100% returns in twelve months. Investing in the stock market was a great big party and everyone was making more money than they could imagine! That is, until the bottom fell out and stock values plummeted and the financial world fell apart. Many stocks dropped 99% in value and the shock waves made millions of people tense and feeling broke to say the least. When I saw the stock market collapse and investors freaking out, I knew I had to take action and help my financial advisor clients with a strategy to calm the nerves of their clients. Advisors needed to take action also and do a lot of handholding during volatile markets like these. The 1990s provided one heck of a party for investors, but the hangover that started in 2000 was sickening. <strong>  The best advisors in our industry went to work and reached out to as many clients as they could possibly reach. Other advisors panicked and went into hiding, avoiding the frantic calls from their clients. </strong></p><h3> You&rsquo;ve got to be proactive</h3><p> <br/> I spoke to a very large audience of wirehouse advisors in 2000, immediately after the dot-com bubble burst in the first quarter.</p><p> At this meeting, I urged the advisors to get on the phone and meet with clients face to face to explain what just happened and what to do next.  Several young advisors raised their hand to comment. <strong>  &ldquo;My clients will kill me if I call them. Their portfolio is down fifty to eighty percent and they are devastated.&rdquo; </strong>   I took a long breath, looked them straight in the eye and calmly explained that if they don&rsquo;t call them, they will lose them as clients forever. We earn their confidence during the tough times, not during the raging Bull markets. This is when strong relationships are forged. This is also when clients fire their advisor for a lack of communication and concern. I urge you to pick up the phone and call as many clients as you can. Be proactive. Don&rsquo;t wait for them to call you. <strong>  Be the leader you are being paid to be. </strong></p><h3> How to make volatility your ally</h3><p> <br/> Your best course of action right now, during this volatile period is to reach out, schedule a face-to-face meeting with your clients and put them at ease. The advisors who did this in 2000 and 2008 solidified their relationships, proved their competence and commitment to their clients and subsequently gained dozens of great referrals. This is the time you act like a pilot on a jet that&rsquo;s taking passengers from Boston to Hong Kong. It&rsquo;s a long ride and there will likely be volatility, but if you communicate with them along the way, you will provide leadership, confidence and direction. In most cases, that&rsquo;s all they need to reassure them that you are their go-to person. Ask them if their financial goals have changed. Since stocks just went on a massive sale, ask if them if they would like to buy more while the prices are lower than last quarter. Ask what you can do to put them at ease. Then just listen. That&rsquo;s one of the best skills of a seasoned and successful financial advisor or anyone in sales. We ask questions and then we listen intently and make sure we are completely present and listening attentively. I know many of you know this already, but it&rsquo;s surprising how many advisors don&rsquo;t practice this. Listening is one of the most important actions you can do right now. Let them vent, raise their concerns, express their worries and tell you what they are hearing from the neighbors and the talking heads on TV. <strong>  Seek first to understand and then to be understood. </strong> I thank Stephen Covey for that quote of course.</p><h3> Create Raving Fans During Volatility</h3><p> <br/> When the markets turn into positive territory, your clients will remember that you were there for them during the volatile times. During a future review, you can mention the beginning of 2016 and how nervous people were. You can show how you and your clients took advantage of the &lsquo;sale&rsquo; and used it to add to their portfolio.  They will appreciate your leadership role and how you listened to their concerns. That&rsquo;s a perfect time to ask them a sincere question.  <strong>  &ldquo;Do you know anyone else I can help like I&rsquo;ve helped you with your retirement portfolio?&rdquo;  </strong>  If you&rsquo;ve done a great job during these volatile times, they will quite often personally introduce you to their wealthy friends who just fired their advisor.  We all know that volatility is just part of the investment world. We don&rsquo;t get big &lsquo;sales events&rsquo; like this very often, but when we do, run with it! Just remember to keep in touch with your clients and prospects during these times and you will be one of the best producers in our industry. Remember, you can reach all the goals you have in your life if you help enough other people reach their goals. It&rsquo;s a Win-Win relationship. <strong>  If you do this now, you may find more clients raving about you and giving you more money.  </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-25 15:18:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-25 15:18:35.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_QnOuqTZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/advisors-be-the-leader-you-are-being-paid-to-be/\", \"post_id\": \"9463\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-25 15:18:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-25 15:18:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"advisors-be-the-leader-you-are-being-paid-to-be\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9462\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4532\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Be-the-Leader-You-Are-Being-Paid-to-Be.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"646\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456549200,"author_id":362,"chart_url":""}

L. Doctorow </strong></p><p> This is lesson for financial services writers. It&rsquo;s about evoking emotion and a reminder that writing about saving and investing doesn&rsquo;t have to be dry. For example, simply saying that it&rsquo;s important to save for retirement isn&rsquo;t enough. It&rsquo;s better to paint a picture about what a comfortable retirement looks like, and explain how your clients can get there.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;To succeed, I do not need to be Shakespeare; I must, though, have a sincere desire to inform.&rdquo; &ndash;Warren Buffett </strong></p><p> It&rsquo;s nice to get a quote from someone who&rsquo;s not a professional writer per se, although his writing is legendary in the industry. The Oracle of Omaha reminds us that when you&rsquo;re writing for an audience that may not fully understand what you&rsquo;re doing, you need to go out of your way to use language that they do understand.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.&rdquo; &ndash;Benjamin Franklin </strong></p><p> We interpret this to mean that your writing, as well as your life, shouldn&rsquo;t be boring. As more and more millennials become your clients, you will be faced with two options: either learn this lesson the hard way or be prepared and start building stronger relationships using engaging copy.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Reading and writing, like everything else, improve with practice.&rdquo; &ndash;Margaret Atwood </strong></p><p> Don&rsquo;t give up if you&rsquo;re struggling with what to write about or how to write it. That struggle may produce some of your best writing.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;I find I have about six bloggable ideas a day. I also find that writing twice as long a post doesn&rsquo;t increase communication, it usually decreases it. And finally, I found that people get antsy if there are unread posts in their queue.&rdquo; &ndash;Seth Godin </strong></p><p> Sometimes shorter is sweeter. In our image-centric world, this message is more true today than ever before. Do you think that Seth&rsquo;s strategy would work for you?

{"original_id":4367,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 Key Insights Into the Future of News","link":"8-key-insights-into-the-future-of-news","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rossdawson\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Vanessa Cartwright  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://rossdawson.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ross Dawson  </u> </a></p><h3> The news industry is undergoing radical transformation. It is also at the forefront of 21st century innovation.</h3>The convenience and hype around live video recording, social media, and a variety of new platforms and interfaces are helping ordinary people to become not only consumers of news, but also creators of news. What does this mean for the future of the news industry?Leading futurist Ross Dawson gave some important insights on &ldquo;Creating the Future of News&rdquo; in his <u> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eIDEdRXwkI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  opening keynote to the 2015 International News Media Association (INMA) World Congress </a></u>. Despite the challenges facing traditional printed news, Dawson pointed to our increasing demand for information. &ldquo;Humans have an insatiable appetite for news and media, and that will continue to grow,&rdquo; Dawson told the New York congress attendees. &ldquo;News is exceptionally important for the future of individuals, for the future of companies, and for the future of humanity.&rdquo;Here are eight key insights into the future of news, drawn from Dawson&rsquo;s talk at the <u> <a href=\"http://www.inma.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  INMA </a></u> congress.<h3> 1. Every organization needs to develop their media capabilities</h3>We all thrive on the flow of news. The relationships between organizations and their customers are no exception. Today, &ldquo;every organization is a media company,&rdquo; Dawson observed. Consequently, organizations across diverse industries need to harness media capabilities. This involves creating an environment in which media skills can be developed and readily tapped. In fact, in the 21st century, most media is created for&mdash;and created by&mdash;everyone. The popularity of Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and many other platforms is turning individuals into news creators in widespread contexts.<h3> 2. News must be immediate, direct, and relevant</h3>The decline of print media is becoming a hard fact in many parts of the world. Dawson is well known for his <u> <a href=\"http://rossdawson.com/frameworks/newspaper-extinction-timeline/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Newspaper Extinction Timeline </a></u> that he created in 2010. Although the futurist believes predictions in general are unreliable, he created the Timeline to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; people who were falling behind in the world of modern media.The reality is, most people now expect news to be instantaneous. Recording functions on devices such as mobile phones and tablets mean that anything anywhere can be recorded and become part of the news. Open source intelligence is changing the news landscape as never before. As a result, timeliness and direct reporting are ever more important.Relevance is also key. Technology is making it easier to customize news for audiences and individuals. Dawson showed how the social value of news flows into the industry value of news, with direct implications for the revenue of news organizations.<h3> 3. Boundaries are there to be transcended</h3>Organizations must push the traditional boundaries of media if they are to survive in the competitive 21st century climate. In his keynote Dawson quoted Professor James Carse, the author of the influential book <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games\" target=\"_blank\">  Finite and Infinite Games </a></u>, saying: &ldquo;Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries.&rdquo;Dawson told the INMA audience that &ldquo;[the concept of] journalism is a boundary which we need to transcend.&rdquo; He cited recent developments in automated journalism as an example of this transcendence.<h3> 4. Engaging people&rsquo;s senses and emotions is key</h3>Visualization will be increasingly important to the future of news, as will interactive user experiences. Infographics, moving 3D charts and multi-format news are already on the rise. Media labs are now using emotion sensors to detect people&rsquo;s reactions to interactive media. The proliferation of interfaces from smartphones to wearables to virtual reality is seeing new experiences such as <u> <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/ja/rift/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Facebook&rsquo;s immersive Oculus Rift headset </a></u>, <u> <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Microsoft&rsquo;s HoloLens holographic computer </a></u>, and <u> <a href=\"http://www.magicleap.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Magic Leap&rsquo;s 3D computer-generated imagery </a></u>.Applying new user experiences to create interactive news media has significant potential. As Dawson noted, the total global crowdfunding raised for film, theater and music was 100 times greater than the amount for stand-alone journalistic pursuits. This suggests the value people place on exciting, immersive experiences.<h3> 5. Organizations need intelligent platform strategies</h3>The flow of news into the future will require platform expansion in order to create the multi-channel news and multi-party interactions appreciated by consumers. Consequently, organizations will need to build a structured method to understand how platforms develop relative to each other. Game theory can be applied to examine the trade-offs and contingencies of choosing particular platforms.Another solution news organizations could consider is building their own platforms. With the right tools and expertise, this can create unique and compelling offers to attract users.<h3> 6. Inviting active participation reaps rewards</h3>Nowadays, we are no longer mere recipients of media. We are participating in media. In some countries, people already spend more time on social media than on accessing formal news sources. News is mobile, and over the next five years, three billion more people will have access to smartphones and the Internet. In this context, news organizations need to consider the many benefits of inviting users to participate in news creation.News organizations must understand that relying on their media professionals alone will no longer be sufficient. According to Dawson, successful companies will harness the power of crowds and automation to add value to their products and services. In his book <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Results-Crowds-definitive-crowdsourcing/dp/0984783806\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Getting Results from Crowds </a></u>, the futurist listed 12 applications of crowdsourcing in news, from <u> <a href=\"http://ireport.cnn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">  iReport </a></u> for reporting to <u> <a href=\"https://storify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Storify </a></u> for story compilation to Cell Journalist (now <u> <a href=\"http://scribbleu.scribblelive.com/Event/ScribbleLive_tips_for_content_engagement/board\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ScribbleLive </a></u>) for video. Dawson believes that organizations who pay their contributors&mdash;including the crowd&mdash;will attract a greater proportion of talented people than their competitors.<h3> 7. Aggregation is critical to entice subscribers</h3>It seems logical that people are more likely to buy a subscription to a news source if it brings together most of the news that interests them. News aggregation is therefore critical to collating the types of individual, local, national and global news that appeal to an organization&rsquo;s target audience. Furthermore, subscriber memberships will need to evolve to make members feel part of a community, with shared values.<h3> 8. Value creation flows between individuals, communities, and ecosystems</h3>&ldquo;True community is connection,&rdquo; Dawson told the INMA audience. In line with this mantra, many newspapers aim to bring their readers together. Some, like <u> <a href=\"https://soulmates.theguardian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Guardian </a></u>, even extend this to creating their own dating websites.

I will be leading a team of five people and I don't have a clue what to do. What advice do you have for new managers? </strong></p><h3> <strong>  A: This is a pretty exciting moment in your career. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When I think back to my first management role, I can say with certainty (and a tinge of regret) that I underestimated just how challenging it was going to be. I talk in my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Corner-Office-Strategies-Business/dp/1601633203/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456079700&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=stealing+the+corner+office\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   book  </a> </u>  about how disheartening it was for me, after 5 years managing people, to finally realize that in fact I was a terrible manager and the people working for me were really not enjoying themselves. The truth of the matter is, every one of us sets out with the intention to be a great manager but so few of us get it right the first time. In the years leading up to our first management roles, most of us get to experience more than our fair share of bad bosses. We tell ourselves, I will never be like him. I'm going to be the best manager these people have ever had. But then the cruel irony of management takes hold. Everyone sets out, determined to be a great manager, but inevitably we fall short. There are just as many people complaining about their crappy manager today as there was ten years ago. No matter how hard we try, it seems being the manager we always wanted, is always harder than we imagined.</p><p> Like many of you, I was tossed into the management mix without much warning and absolutely no training. One day I was an individual contributor with a great track record and all the potential in the world, and the next day I was managing a team of 4 people and screwing it all up. I made every mistake. And what's worse, it took me many years to realize it. I did a lot of damage without even knowing it. To be perfectly honest, it wasn't until fairly recently that I started feeling like I really understand what the purpose of a manager is, and the mindset you need be a good one. My hope in sharing some advice, is that you can accelerate the path we all have to go through. Sadly, in my experience, there's no avoiding the mistakes entirely. I don't think anyone is naturally born to be a great manager - born with leadership qualities, yes - but effective management demands purposeful practice. You have to make a point of being a good manager, you don't just get to be one because you're talented.</p><p> Here are four lessons about managing people that took me a lot longer than it should have to learn. I often wish I had come to realize these things earlier. Maybe I could have had a more positive impact on the lives and careers of the people I was leading at the time. I hope you find value in them and become a great manager for the people you lead.  </p><h3> <strong>  1. Embrace your authentic style.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> There is no optimal style of leadership. There is no approach or personality or tone that you must follow. The only rule about management style, in my opinion, is to express your authentic self. The biggest mistake I see young managers make is be inauthentic. They behave as though they are playing the role of a manager on TV more so than exhibiting any kind of authentic leadership. They are \"acting\" like they think a manager is supposed to be instead of actually leading with the best parts of their true personality. The result, more often than not, is a very rigid, overly formal, disconnected manager, who is too busy portraying the stereotypical manager persona to actually connect in a meaningful way with the people they're meant to be leading.</p><p> One good litmus test for whether or not you're embracing your authentic management style can be found in your communication. Compare how you speak and write at work with how you speak and write with your family and friends. If you discover a material difference, you're not being authentic and you need to change. Sure, you should drop the F bombs when you're at work (probably with your family and friends too ... just sayin ...) but there really shouldn't be a significant difference between how you communicate in life and how you communicate at work. One of my biggest peeves in the workplace is how much faux-formal business correspondence there is. Managers spend so much time packaging their communication to sound professional that it completely comprises any measure of authenticity they might have. </p><p> My advice to managers is to drop the pretense. Stop with the formal communication. Stop positioning what you say. Stop trying to sound smart. Stop acting like a leader and just be one. When you write, when you speak, be your natural, friendly, goofy self and your team and colleagues will embrace it. </p><h3> <strong>  2. Stop directing traffic. Start enlisting support.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is one that took me a particularly long time to figure out. When you first start managing, you instinctively start telling people what to do. You think that's what a manager does - delegate, direct. But while direction and delegation have their place, they aren't what really drives a team to success. The best managers rally support for a common purpose and provide team members the autonomy to pursue it together.</p><p> Instead of focusing so much time telling people what you need them to do, you should spend far more time energizing people about what is possible. Directing is easy, inspiring is hard. The importance of this only increases the higher you get in an organization. By the time you're in the executive ranks, you can't realistically direct the people you're managing to how to do their jobs anyways - they're the experts. What you can do - what you must do - is give them personal reasons to embrace the vision and goals you have set for the team. If you can get your team to WANT to reach a goal, you'll have a much better chance of hitting it than if you simply deconstruct the goal into projects and delegate them to the members of your team. </p><p> Often times as managers we feel like we should always know what to do and how to do it. I disagree with that premise entirely. A great leader, in my opinion, provides a clear vision of the desired outcome and creates an environment for people to come up with creative ways to get there. They don't necessarily know how to get there themselves. Some of the best leaders I've worked with would come into a meeting and say something like, </p><p> \"Guys, we have to find a way to deliver the new web site this quarter. To be honest, I've never built a web site this big - that fast, but its important to the business, and could be a big win for us. How can we do it?\"</p><p> For me, as an employee, that would be exciting. Knowing that my boss had a clear vision but didn't have all the answers, and needed my expertise to get it done. That's what I want in my manager.</p><p> My advice to new managers is to stop focusing so much on delegation and direction, and start focusing more on providing a clear vision and rallying support of your team to help achieve it. </p><h3> <strong>  3. Get in the middle of it all.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> When we first get into management, I think a lot of us assume that the manager's job is to sit on the sideline and supervise. We've all had bosses like this so we naturally veer in this direction. I see a lot of managers maintain an arm's length from what the team is actually doing on a day to day basis. This is a mistake in my opinion, and I made it for years.</p><p> We tell ourselves as new managers that whatever we do, we won't, under any circumstance, be a micro manager. We've all had experiences working for micro managers and we hate it. And while our intentions are certainly noble enough, they too often result in unintended consequences. The only thing worse than a micro manager is a manager who is so disconnected from the team that they can't fairly assess the people on the team and they can't help people get better. The other damaging byproduct of sitting on the sidelines is that when your team does present their work to you, your role is reduced to criticism. Work is completed by the team and presented to you and then you tell them if its good or not. That's not management. That's assessment and it doesn't lead to high quality work or a positive workplace environment.</p><p> In my experience the best managers spend a ton of time sitting in the trenches with their teams - right in the middle of everything. They aren't micro managing - they're participating, helping, understanding. I'm sure some of you will be thinking, \"whoa, I don't want my boss hanging over my shoulder all day while I'm working ...\" but that is because you have a crappy boss. When you're managing effectively, and your team knows you genuinely care about them, they will want you in there with them. When you're there all the time, as part of the process, the pressure of presenting final work to you will be reduced and the probability that the work is of high quality will be increased.</p><p> My advice to managers is to get off the sidelines. Get out of your office. You need to strike a balance between being an active participant in the daily work lives of your team without becoming a micro manager. Its a delicate balance to be sure, but one that when reached will pay big dividends for you and your team members.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Find out what your team members want and help them get it.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> When I first started managing people I operated under the false assumption that they were there to help me reach my goals. I had objectives, targets, a quota ... and I had human resources in place to help me achieve them. Maybe that sounds callous to you, maybe it doesn't, but until recently I don't think I fully appreciated my real mandate as a manager. Nor did I appreciate how that mandate, when executed with sincerity, ultimately leads to optimal outcomes for the company and for my own career.</p><p> As I talked about briefly in my recent blog on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/blog-1/2016/1/2/the-unicorn-recruiting-trap-why-ive-stopped-hunting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Recruiting Unicorns  </a> </u> , the job of the manager, in my opinion, is to create an environment where people can be the best possible versions of themselves. A big part of that is to understand what each person on the team wants for themselves and for their careers, and to get personally invested in helping them achieve it. Where the real magic comes into place is when you find creative ways to align the attainment of those personal goals with the attainment of team and company goals. If you can do that, you create the kind of sincere energy you need to have a truly exceptional team.</p><p> Too many managers fixate on company and team goals and forget about the individual goals of each member of the team. Without a real connection and understanding of what people dream of for themselves, you can never get their full emotional energy directed at the goals and objectives of the company. My advice to managers is to start by seeking to understand the people on the team and then figure out how to tie the attainment of your goals with the attainment of theirs.</p><p> Managing people is tough and it's a journey. You may have been born with natural leadership qualities, but being a great manager takes practice and experience. I hope you can benefit from some of the lessons I've learned along my journey to being a better manager.

Some were great. And some went horribly wrong.</p><p> So what was the difference ? Invariably, I found that a big part of the difference was made by whether or not those selling to the C-suite answered 5 key questions before setting foot in the door.</p><h3> 1. What does this person care about ?</h3><p> <br/> All too often, I see people walk into the room and completely ignore the first step of any conversation: to connect with others on a human level. Yes, senior executives are human too. Yes, they appreciate good manners. And yes, they value being asked about their life outside of the office.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t overdo it. Be sincere. Ask a simple question to get things started. That&rsquo;s all it takes.</p><h3> 2. How will I start the conversation ?</h3><p> <br/> Much like investor pitches, presentations or the latest episode of your favorite TV-series, how you start predicts (mostly) how you&rsquo;ll end up.</p><p> When I ask clients about their pre-meeting prep process, most will tell me about their company research, how they uncovered 3&ndash;4 issues that are likely to be on their prospect&rsquo;s mind or what they want to accomplish during the meeting.</p><p> Few tell me about their strategy to start.</p><p> Think about the first thing you will bring up during the meeting when it&rsquo;s time to talk business. Which question will you ask first ? What issue will you bring up ? What unexpected facts or insights will you deliver ?</p><h3> 3. What value will I bring ?</h3><p> <br/> In  <u>  this presentation on Slideshare </u> , 10 of today&rsquo;s sales leaders paint a picture of what sales will look like in 10 years. All make good points.</p><p> But one makes a great one. Jill Konrath talks about &ldquo;sales people will create value in every interaction.&rdquo;</p><p> Value is not just about delivering new insights. It comes in many forms. Financial value. Value exchanged for time. Relationship value. Value in ideas. Value in information.</p><p> Before you walk into the meeting, ask three simple questions:</p><li> What kind(s) of value will I add in this conversation ?</li><li> How will I personally deliver value to this person ?</li><li> In what ways can we create shared value together ? <br/>  </li><h3> 4. What new ideas will I introduce ?</h3><p> <br/> According to RAIN Group&rsquo;s latest research on  <u>  &ldquo;What Sales Winners Do (Differently)&rdquo; </u> , the #1 factor that buyers cite when asked why they bought from firm A versus firm B was &ldquo;they educated me with new ideas and perspectives&rdquo;.</p><p> We&rsquo;re talking NEW ideas here. Not old ones. Not popular ones. Not generally accepted ones.</p><p> In others words, prospects buy from those who &ldquo;tell them something they didn&rsquo;t already know&rdquo;. What new ideas can you introduce ? What counterintuitive wisdom can you share ? How can you back up your claims ?</p><h3> 5. How will I end the conversation ?</h3><p> <br/> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/c-suite-advice-7-rules-for-meetings-with-top-execs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;7 Rules For Meetings With Top Executives&rdquo;  </a> </u>  on Inc.com, Geoffrey James&rsquo; last point is &ldquo;Close on a next step&rdquo;. Unless you have a clear idea of how you&rsquo;d like to end the conversation, one of three things is likely to happen:</p><li> Nothing (happens surprisingly often)</li><li> They will advance their agenda</li><li> You will advance your sale <br/>  </li><p> To Geoffrey&rsquo;s point, when selling to the C-suite it&rsquo;s often a great idea to ask the executive what they would like to do next. But in my experience, it&rsquo;s even better to present them with 2&ndash;3 scenarios to pick from.</p><p> Most likely, they&rsquo;ll come up with a 4th one that remixes elements from the 3 you mentioned. Great. They&rsquo;re on board, they&rsquo;re invested and you know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p><p> <strong>  Personally, I would not dream of entering an executive&rsquo;s office without answering these 5 questions. Try it out for yourself.

This Next-Gen CEO event was a fantastic opportunity to bring together progressive and innovative leaders from a variety of companies and industries to share insights and learn from one another.</p><p> The evening began with a TINYtalk from author and CEO  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talonnllc.com/meet-teri/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Teri Citterman  </a> </u>  (see above) on what it takes to be a next-generation leader. After that, attendees moved to breakout sessions to engage with one another on two questions that drilled down to the heart of leadership.</p><p> Here are some of the results from this meeting of the minds:</p><h3> \"Besides integrity, what&rsquo;s the one behavior or trait you think every leader must have in order to be great?\" <br/>  </h3><p> There was no limit to the insightful answers attendees gave to this question.</p><h3> Getting Through the Tough Times <br/>  </h3><li> \"Self-confidence\" was the answer given by <strong>  Stephanie Camp </strong> , VP of Marketing at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.limeade.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Limeade  </a> </u> .</li><li> \"Resilience\" was the answer given by <strong>  Carolyn Thayer </strong> , Senior Account Director at  <u>  <a href=\"http://adurolife.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ADURO  </a> </u> .</li><li> <strong>  Jena Miller </strong> of  <u>  <a href=\"http://gravitypayments.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gravity Payments  </a> </u>  chose resilience too, saying, \"As a CEO or business owner, you have a lot happening ...

He also noted the effect it had on employees, \"Enough passion from the top spills down and fills crevices below.\"</li><li> That idea echoes the response of speaker and author  <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://avawaits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Ava Waits   </a>  </u> </strong> , who chose, \"Leading by example.\"</li><li> \"Accountability\" was the choice of <strong>  Chris Canavan </strong> , Partner at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.facetadvisors.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facet Advisors  </a> </u> . <br/>  </li><h3> Taking Time to Take Care <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Dave Rigotti </strong> , Head of Marketing at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bizible.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bizible  </a> </u> , chose empathy, saying, \"For a lot of my employees, it's their first job, and you can forget what it's like to be young and fresh out of school. Empathy is big for culture and for your customers.\" He advises, \"You don't want to get too caught up with running the business and team,\" and forget about this quality. <br/>  </li><p> A couple of answers given by attendees who chose to remain anonymous included:</p><li> \"Fun. When times get tough, you need to have fun or just go in the corner and cry.\"</li><li> \"Humility. As great as you think you may be, there are always opportunities to learn and improve.\" <br/>  </li><h3> \"Have you served as a mentor to a future leader? If so, what do you think are the most important things you have imparted?\" <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Here is some of the wisdom our attendees have given young leaders. </strong></p><li> <strong>  Michelle Flandreau </strong> , Producer at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.king5.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   KING 5  </a> </u> , shared, \"Being an intentional leader: thinking about how you are mentoring those people and communicating the process and investing in them.

{"original_id":4373,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Bankers Will Survive the Next 20 Years","link":"why-bankers-will-survive-the-next-20-years","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently I wrote a blog on the  <u>  top 15 jobs most likely to disappear </u> . Quite a few readers asked me why bankers were not on that list. A valid and logical question. Technology is changing fast and the possibilities tech solutions bring us are innumerable, but still the world is not ready yet for an economic paradigm without bankers. Unfortunately, I might add. Fintech has set in the unbundling of banking, but are not making banks obsolete (yet). Is it in the first place because money exists? Because our payment infrastructure is too complex to disrupt? Here&rsquo;s why it will take longer for banker jobs to become extinct.</p><p> People who have money, want to do something with that money. To make sure their bank balance grows and &ndash; with that growth in mind &ndash; to minimise tax payments by looking for loopholes within the legal framework. Banking products are enabling them to do this. Besides that, we are dealing with an economic model that is being kept up by financial institutions and regulators that are very outdated. These traditional paradigms will keep on existing as long as fintech cannot fully cover all the necessary stacks in the payment value chain. It will take over 25 years to change into an infrastructure that can maintain a paradigm in which fintech start-ups can meet all needs and demands organisations and consumers have in relation to banking facilities. To realise that, the most important need that the paradigm requires in order to drive this enormous change is trust. After everything society has been through during the financial crisis and it&rsquo;s aftershock, trust might be the most difficult asset in the process. Not that people trust banks all that much, but they do have been relying on their finance monopoly for ages. Legacy is withholding bankers from their elimination. For now. Next to that, we should not forget that the entry into the banking system is very expensive as part of the regulatory environment that is protecting banks.  <u>  Regulators are government and therefore slow in change </u> .</p><h3> Unbundling of banking</h3><p> <br/> The above said, the process of changing has already been in progress for a while. Since the financial crisis, banks have to survive in a market that has been subject to strict new capital regulations. This causes a drastic reformation of the capital market. Furthermore, banks are experiencing competition from a significant volume of financial technology start-ups that don&rsquo;t have to obey these regulations.</p><p> What is happening today is that fintech initiatives are slowly taking over small parts of the payment stack value chain. This is called the &lsquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/disrupting-banking-fintech-startups/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unbundling of banking  </a> </u> &rsquo;. Just because banks have been sitting on the finance throne for ages, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are invincible. Although banks are trying to incorporate innovation, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they can keep controlling the economic paradigm. Start-ups are reinventing the banking business, particularly in retail banking. Many ambitious fintech start-ups come up with smart solutions that are capable to disrupt parts of the finance world.</p><h3> The disruption of money nearby</h3><p> <br/> Isn&rsquo;t money a bit old fashion by now? There are other ways of evaluating goods, assets and capital. Take for instance  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/12123482/The-fintech-revolution-that-promises-to-finish-off-the-big-bad-banks-for-good.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bitcoin or blockchain  </a> </u> . But let&rsquo;s begin with a simpler example. How often do you pay cash or take out money from the cash dispenser nowadays? And how many payments do you process through digital solutions? So, what is the added value of the current monetary system? I do not claim to have the answer, I&rsquo;m just curious on how this could be disrupted. Should it be disrupted?  <u>  <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#what-is-bitcoin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bitcoin  </a> </u>  is cool. Blockchain technology is deliciously disruptive. But it is not enough. Is this phase it could never replace traditional money. And before a tech solution could ever replace it, there is the urgency of security. The necessity of knowing what dilemma&rsquo;s will eventually be capable of endangering the data and capital of people is crucial. What can be invented, can be hacked. Right? The true currency of bankers is trust. Since others are less trustworthy than bankers, it will be a matter of time for someone to take up this glove and eliminate the old legacy burdened banks.</p><p> <img alt=\"Oldfashion tech\" src=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3213810377_0c8f7c7834_b-1024x683.jpg\"/></p>Photo credit CC: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhembach/3213810377/in/album-72157612810229390/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Jens Hembach</a><br/> <h3> The worthy component: security</h3><p> <br/> Changing the economic infrastructure by using different currency systems and payment technologies will require a whole lot more, like a different set of regulations and security measures.</p><p> Simplicity. Regulators are demanding this, customers are expecting it. Start-ups are emerging, delivering financial services with easy-to-use apps. The unbundling of banking is undoubtedly complicated.  Also, there are probably still numerous dangers that haven&rsquo;t been identified yet. Therefore, it is all about getting back to basics.</p><p> Digital payment are becoming more accessible. End-users (thus customers) are eagerly adopting digital payment solutions. Therefore, the emphasis within fintech and the unbundling of banking should be on security. The substantial investment in fintech will also significantly change how consumers deal with financial products. Fintech start-ups seem to address the changing needs of customers a lot better. Also, the technologies are highly scalable with the use of mobile platforms. This will increasingly change the way people will be enabled to borrow and to trade. Investing will become a whole different ball game. Imagine the profound implications for the way companies will interact with their customers. The transformation towards so called &lsquo; <a href=\"http://thefinancialbrand.com/55952/2016-top-banking-trends-predictions-forecast-digital-fintech/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  platformification </a>  &lsquo;, where companies will be offering a combination of goods and services on mobile platforms, has already began. Within a few years fintech solutions will be expanded considerably. Is our security ready for a technological evolvement like this? Or will a fintech disruption trample us? No and yes. Today that is.</p><p> So, there is still a long way to go. Security and infrastructure issues need to be covered and there is that matter of customer trust in order to achieve complete adoption. Until then, we won&rsquo;t wave the banker goodbye. Let&rsquo;s involve them in the transformation. They might be very traditional from mind, but they still hold a lot of important knowledge. Maybe this will even create the balance in the pace of innovation that we need right now.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-25 21:07:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-25 21:07:34.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_HjaQvlU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-bankers-will-survive-the-next-20-years/\", \"post_id\": \"9476\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-25 21:07:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-25 21:07:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-bankers-will-survive-the-next-20-years\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9475\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4540\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Bankers-Will-Survive-the-Next-20-Years.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"699\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456610400,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4374,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Improve the Omnichannel Experience, Reduce Customer Effort","link":"improve-the-omnichannel-experience-reduce-customer-effort","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How would your customers rate your omnichannel experience? It's probably time to make that a priority, if it isn't yet.</h3><p> <br/> Customer effort is (or should be) a huge area of concern for customer experience professionals; it's major point of contention and frustration for customers.  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2012/06/whats-your-customer-effort-score.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Measuring customer effort </a>  is probably one of the best ways to understand if you're delivering a great customer experience; effort is a key driver of satisfaction and of the overall experience, no doubt. If you're not asking a customer effort question on your transactional surveys, it's time to add the question; the responses will likely be eye-opening!</p><p> If you're thinking about reducing customer effort, one of the most impactful ways to do so is to take a look at your omnichannel experience. Don't confuse that with multichannel or any of the other \"xx-channel\" terms. There's a difference! Let's start with defining multichannel versus omnichannel.</p><h3> <strong>  Multichannel  </strong></h3><p> refers to offering or using multiple channels to interact with their customers, for purchases, support, or whatever the customer is trying to achieve with the company. Multichannel does not refer to a consistent, seamless experience across channels. The experience is not optimized across channels, and the channels are not integrated in any fashion. This can lead to a very fragmented experience for customers.</p><h3> <strong>  Omnichannel </strong></h3><p> refers to using these multiple channels to interact with customers (or for them to engage with you) but in a consistently seamless way. The experience is consistent with each channel, and companies know who the customer is and what she's done at any previous channel with which she's  interacted with them. In other words, omnichannel is all about delivering a seamless brand experience across and with all channels. Regardless of which of those channels your customers use, they feel like they are getting the same, personalized experience; they don't have to start from scratch with each interaction. To them, you appear as one brand from channel to channel. (It sounds odd to say that, but you know there are plenty of brands out there that are very disjointed from channel to channel.)</p><p> I'm going to focus on the omnichannel experience. I think most businesses know that they've got to offer multiple channels with which customers can interact with them. But far fewer have mastered how to make the entire channel ecosystem experience effective; they haven't made it a priority to integrate the experience across all of those channels.</p><h3> Why is this important?</h3><p> <br/> According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/us/industries/retail/retail-omnichannel-challenge-2374327.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research  </a> </u>  by Oracle Retail and Retail TouchPoints about the shopping experience...</p><p> <strong>  Omnichannel shoppers are the most valuable. These consumers are significantly more valuable compared to single-channel: More than 45% of retail executives report that omnichannel shoppers are 11% to 50% more valuable; and close to 3% said they are up to 200% more valuable. </strong></p><p> Three of the most significant ways that their value/profitability is measured include: frequency of shopping trips, total dollar value of purchases over time, and average basket size.  I don't think we can argue with any of those metrics when we think about the value of a customer. These types of results speak to focusing on the omnichannel experience - simplifying it and reducing the work that customers have to do when they are interacting with your company. <br/> <br/> If you want to effect change that results in reduced effort and an improved omnichannel experience, it will take a herculean endeavor. Why? Because, first of all, by definition, it's not something that each individual department can fix or improve on its own. It's an organization-wide transformation, and it begins with executive commitment and then moves into understanding your data inputs, outputs, infrastructure, and flow.  <br/> <br/> Once the executive team is on board (resources, budget, etc.) with this transformation, there are two key next steps:</p><li> <strong>  Silos must be broken down. </strong> This is a culture thing. Departments need to start talking to each other, working together, and sharing data and information. Key to this is helping each department understand how they impact the customer experience, i.e., importantly, that every department touches a single experience in one way or another. The best tool to facilitate this understanding is a  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/11/18-reasons-to-map-customer-journeys.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  journey map </a> .</li><li> <strong>  You must have a   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2015/04/achieving-single-customer-view-through.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    single view of the customer   </a>  </u>  . </strong> In order for this to happen, data must be shared. In order for that to happen, your CIO must prioritize the work; without that prioritization, forget about it. The key to an improved omnichannel experience and, hence, a reduction in customer effort, is data. It must be shared across departments and channels; in order to do that, you've got to have the right architecture and infrastructure in place to capture it, centralize it, and get it into the hands of the right people at the right time in a format that makes sense and is actionable. No small feat! It has to be given top priority. Now. <br/>  </li><p> The crux of the matter, the reason that the omnichannel experience breaks down, is that the business acts like it doesn't know the customer at every touchpoint. For the customer, that means that he has to \"re-authenticate\" at every interaction; he has to start each interaction with identifying himself, what he's trying to do, who he's already talked to, where he's been, etc. You're a customer. You know all about this. It's so frustrating. Why perpetuate this experience with your own customers.</p><p> Customers and prospects today are extremely savvy and informed. They want to browse, shop, talk, and otherwise interact with companies through a variety of channels: phone, web, in store, social media, app, mobile, web chat, and more. The bottom line is that companies need to allow customers to do so using whatever channel is most convenient for the customer; most importantly, those channels must afford a seamless and personalized experience. Then, and only then, will you have successfully reduced customer effort in a way that is meaningful and impactful.</p><h3> Are you ready?</h3><p> <br/> In the future, I'll write about a channel that you may not think about when you're making the transition and the transformation from multichannel to omnichannel experiences.</p><p> <strong>  The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be. -Bruce Lee </strong></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-25 21:17:39.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-25 21:17:39.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_JQGuclM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/improve-the-omnichannel-experience-reduce-customer-effort/\", \"post_id\": \"9477\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-25 21:17:39\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-25 21:17:39\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"improve-the-omnichannel-experience-reduce-customer-effort\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9475\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4541\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Bankers-Will-Survive-the-Next-20-Years.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"355\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456516800,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4375,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Eight Traits of Highly Successful Advisors","link":"eight-traits-of-highly-successful-advisors","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The advisor industry continues to evolve as innovation disrupts the status quo.</h3><p> <br/> Advisors are facing new challenges, whether they are harnessing the power of technology, confronting the prevailing downward pressure on fees, managing the impact of demographic shifts, or mastering a fast-moving market. What has worked in the past may not necessarily work in the future. But for those who can evolve with the industry, there will be greater opportunities ahead.</p><p> In our recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com/knowledge-bank/articles/advisor-authority-the-innovation-and-issues-that-rias-and-fee-based-advisors-care-about-most/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Advisor Authority  </a> </u>  study of 535 RIAs and fee-based advisors nationwide conducted by Harris Poll, Jefferson National examined the issues that advisors care about the most. The vast majority believe that the profitability of their own practice will increase over the next 12 months. Supporting a movement to greater simplicity, transparency, choice, and ultimately the creation of greater value, RIAs and fee-based advisors are driving this change&mdash;and helping to create the future.</p><p> To help all advisors learn more from the thought leaders and innovators of our industry, Advisor Authority focused on three segments of successful advisors:</p><li> <strong>  The High Earning Advisor  </strong> &mdash; Those advisors with personal yearly income of over $500,000 from their advisor business. Most of these advisors are marketing innovators and forward-thinkers regarding technology.</li><li> <strong>  The Advisor with High AUM </strong>  &mdash; Those advisors who individually manage a total AUM of $250 million or more. These advisors tend to be more tech savvy than the typical advisor.</li><li> <strong>  The Tech Innovator </strong>  &mdash; Those advisors who plan on integrating new technology in the next year, use 7 or more software applications, have a strategy to enhance integration of technology and software, and spend over $50,000 annually on technology. <br/>  </li><p> As we studied these three segments &mdash; evaluating their approach, their areas of focus and their use of technology &mdash; we identified eight traits of highly successful advisors who are driving change in our industry.</p><h3> 1. Become an expert:</h3><p> Target clients who are in a specific profession, specialize in a particular type of service or experience, or become a subject matter expert. The planner who can work with everybody ends up working with no one. One of the advisors we surveyed, Drew Bottaro, vice president and senior financial counselor at Weston Financial, echoed that sentiment: &ldquo;Our strategy focuses on targeting the right opportunities, rather than trying to capture them all.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. Be a Technology Innovator:</h3><p> Industry studies showing that advisors who effectively leverage technology achieve greater efficiencies, serve more clients and run materially more successful practices than those who don&rsquo;t. Advisors with high AUMs spend more on technology than the average advisor. They also use more technology to make their job more seamless. To them, the only thing more expensive than adding technology is not adding technology.</p><h3> 3. Be a Marketing Innovator: </h3><p> Successful advisors communicate the way that their clients want to communicate. They continue to adopt and integrate with new technologies that their clients are using. But remember &mdash; at the end of the day, people still want to talk to people. &ldquo;Marketing is not a department at our firm &mdash; marketing is the way we operate,&rdquo; says another advisor in the survey, Michael Grossman, president of AdviceOne Empowerment Coaching LLC and AdviceOne Advisory Services LLC.</p><h3> 4. Go Mobile: </h3><p> Growth comes from the power that you can hold in the palm of your hand. Clients and advisors alike are connected, but not tied down, to their offices. Anywhere you go at any time, you are connected to your clients. As new technologies are being integrated into practices, mobile features &mdash; especially mobile applications, smart phones, tablets, and cloud-based &mdash; are becoming increasingly important.</p><h3> 5. Be a Client Advocate: </h3><p> Your relationship is with the people who own the assets, not with the assets themselves. Do what is purely and utterly in the client&rsquo;s best interest. You and everyone on your team should be focused on retaining clients and creating ambassadors. Again, from Michael Grossman: &ldquo;If you and everyone on your team is focused on retaining clients &mdash; retaining ambassadors who will shout from the rooftops how great their financial advisor is&mdash;that&rsquo;s when your marketing goes through the roof.&rdquo; Satisfied clients are happy to pay you more and refer you more often.</p><h3> 6. Retain Heirs: </h3><p> &ldquo;First, we determine where the wealth is coming from,&rdquo; says Drew Bottaro, when determining if the heir will be a suitable client for his firm. &ldquo;Is it earned by the heir? Is it cascading down? Is it from a multi-generational wealth system? Next, we support that with a multi-person engagement team in which we pair clients and heirs with counselors of different ages.&rdquo; Focus on the right opportunities. Heirs leave because no one was thinking about them. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p><h3> 7. Ruthlessly Refine: </h3><p> Make the investments and take the deliberate cuts that will free up the time to deal with the challenges, take advantage of the opportunities and actually work on your business. One example is the use of industry technology. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing more and more industry studies showing that advisors who effectively leverage technology are running materially more successful practices,&rdquo; says Michael Kitces, partner and director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group. &ldquo;Technology lets you do more awesome stuff for your clients.&rdquo;</p><h3> 8. Risk Happens: </h3><p> Diversify and hedge portfolios with liquid alternatives and different risk streams like tactical fixed income, tactical all-asset and managed futures. In the face of volatility, there is still an opportunity to participate, to protect and, most importantly, to prepare the client.</p><h3> The industry is evolving. And RIAs and fee-based advisors have every reason to be optimistic.</h3><p> <br/> As the world gets more complex, the opportunity for advisors to provide holistic planning and guided advice continues to grow. Likewise, more clients recognize &mdash; and demand &mdash; the value of transparent and unbiased financial advice. Adopting the eight traits of highly successful advisors, advisors of all sizes and at every level of experience can navigate this changing landscape to build meaningful relationships with their clients, drive greater growth for their businesses and ultimately create greater value.</p><p> Mitchell H.

{"original_id":4376,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What You Should Expect to Pay for Content Marketing","link":"what-you-should-expect-to-pay-for-content-marketing","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The question of how much you should expect to pay for content marketing seems to be a mystery to most.</h3><p> <br/> Often times, it can be difficult to get a sense for how much you should be budgeting for content marketing and what a fair price to pay even is, especially if you&rsquo;re not quite clear on your marketing goals.</p><p> Not to worry. If you&rsquo;re thinking about investing in content marketing resources and are scratching your head over how much you should expect to pay for these types of marketing services, you&rsquo;re not alone! That&rsquo;s why in this post, I&rsquo;m going to untangle this largely untalked about topic and color the lines in for you.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s just jump right to it shall we, dear friends. Here is a breakdown of content marketing resource options and pricing:</p><h3> <strong>  Option 1: </strong>  Hiring an in-house content marketing specialist/strategist/manager ($50,000/yr to $100,000/yr)</h3><p> <br/> Having a full time employee can be a great option if you have the adequate resources to support this role and function. These individuals will be talented in crafting your content strategy, overseeing the execution of the strategy and will likely have creative and/or analytical core competencies for some of the deliverables (but probably not all). Knowing that many financial and other professional service firms function on a shoestring marketing budget, this can be a wonderful resource that definitely pays for itself over time. Visit  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Content_Marketing_Manager/Salary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   payscale.com  </a> </u>  or  <a href=\"http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=Content+marketing+manager&amp;l1=san+diego\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  indeed.com </a>  to search for these professionals and salary ranges in your area.</p><p> With this option, you should also be prepared to allow this role the ability shop out the skills he doesn&rsquo;t possess (and that don&rsquo;t currently exist within your firm) so that he can effectively do his job. Anything from graphic designer, SEO experts, web developers to copywriters and photographers may be on his wish list.</p><h3> <strong>  Option 2: </strong>  Outsourcing to a content marketing agency ($1,500+ content marketing strategy; $1,000/mo to $10,000/mo ongoing services)</h3><p> <br/> A content marketing agency will likely be your all-in-one solution for your content marketing needs and will supply the strategy with all the resources necessary to execute and manage your content marketing program. Content marketing agencies supply and manage the full team of talent required to run your content marketing program. Not to mention, they will either fold in the needed technical systems with their retainer or make it easy for you to select the right ones.</p><p> Due to the long-game nature of content marketing, agencies will most likely charge an upfront  <u>  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/content-marketing/this-is-how-to-plan-your-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   strategy planning  </a> </u>  fee and then propose a minimum 6 month to 1 year retainer for ongoing planning and services. This agency relationship and service is structured this way to ensure your content marketing program&rsquo;s success.</p><h3> <strong>  Option 3: </strong>  Hiring creative freelancers ($50-$300/hr; $100-$3,000 per deliverable)</h3><p> <br/> This is an ideal option if you are on a tighter budget and have a very specific project/function you need done. These are your writers,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.angie-webb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   graphic designers  </a> </u> , social media experts, marketing consultants, photographers, etc. Maybe you already have a marketing plan in place that you (or someone else) is managing and you notice a gap in skills or there is just a particular function you would prefer to outsource like copywriting for your blog, managing your social media or email campaigns and designing infographics.

I have hired freelancers my entire career for various projects as an in-house marketer, when I was starting my own business and even now if a special need arises.

That being said, pricing for content marketing truly does fall into a wide range depending on your needs, the content marketing professional&rsquo;s experience and geographic location.

They wanted to learn how to knit because they love infinity scarves, but they were apprehensive about starting something new because they were afraid of making a mistake.</p><p> <strong>  Clients often have the same bout of fear when they first start investing or planning for the future. </strong> Lack of experience can make people feel vulnerable or anxious. To help them overcome their fears, I told my daughters the same thing I tell my clients: Never let fear of the unknown prevent you from living your best lives.</p><p> I encouraged my daughters to read the manual and then try to follow the example. The same is true for the financial planning process. Although many people know that saving for their financial future is important, many don't know what steps to take to accomplish their goals. Whether you're aiming to purchase a home, pay for college or save for retirement, you have to figure out how to properly manage your financial resources in order to achieve your life goals. It's important to know that financial planning is a process, not a transaction.</p><p> <strong>  Here are some other ways to feel more confident about planning for the future: </strong></p><h3> 1. Have patience.</h3><p> <br/> My younger daughter, Karolina, was so excited about her project that she rushed her knitting and got her yarn twisted. I spent about 30 minutes to an hour untwisting $5 worth of yarn. (What was I thinking? I was so tempted to quit myself! After all, time is money.) The  <u>  <a href=\"http://rd.bizrate.com/rd?t=http%3A%2F%2Flink.mercent.com%2Fredirect.ashx%3Fmr%3AmerchantID%3DBackcountry%26mr%3AtrackingCode%3D2D764F3D-6672-E511-80F3-005056944E17%26mr%3AtargetUrl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Flucy-dashing-stripes-infinity-scarf%253fCMP_SKU%253dLUC004U%2526MER%253d0406%2526CMP_ID%253dSH_CNXTY%2526mv_pc%253dr111%2526003%253d7163333%2526010%253dLUC004U%2526utm_source%253dShopzilla%2526utm_medium%253dCSE%26szredirectid%3DSZ_REDIRECT_ID&amp;mid=23611&amp;cat_id=10130500&amp;atom=10340&amp;prod_id=&amp;oid=6556360959&amp;pos=1&amp;b_id=18&amp;bid_type=1&amp;bamt=a5fedf14fd8fec0d&amp;cobrand=1&amp;ppr=854553f8fb29ad4b&amp;af_sid=81&amp;mpid=LUC004U&amp;keyword=infinity%20scarf&amp;rf=af1&amp;af_assettype_id=10&amp;af_creative_id=2912\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   infinity scarf  </a> </u>  may have been too advanced for a beginner. Karolina said, \"Mom, I learned my lesson.\"</p><p> Careful analysis and preparation are essential elements of any sound financial plan. I have heard stories about folks so eager to start investing that they become impatient and rush into investments that aren't right for their situations. The unpleasant outcomes of doing so breeds resentment, and they become discouraged.</p><p> Well-planned diversification is key! Don't put all your hopes into one investment idea. And don't be afraid to start slowly by investing smaller amounts of money on a regular basis to build financial confidence.</p><h3> 2. Learn to enjoy the process.</h3><p> <br/> Once the colorful yarn was untwisted, the girls could see the intricacies of the process. They were inspired and discovered a new passion. Karolina felt as though she had started a new trend. She is thrilled to bring her yarn and loom to use in between her events at swim meets because it is calming. My older daughter, Sarina, loves the flexibility of knitting anytime and anywhere.</p><p> In financial planning and investing, clients should enjoy milestones, such as paying off student loan debt, creating an emergency fund or contributing the maximum amount to their retirement accounts. If you can find pleasure in the process, you will be motivated to do more.</p><h3> 3. Make it a family affair.</h3><p> <br/> I'm not exactly the craftiest person, but I encourage my girls to try something new and cheer them on. I reminded them what it was like when they started to learn how to play piano and swim butterfly.</p><p> It is no different with clients: I support their decisions and motivate them to take risks. As parents and financial advisers, we need to recognize people will make mistakes. Whether you do the wrong stitch or accidentally incur an overdraft fee, the most important thing is that you learn from your mistakes, apply your knowledge and gain confidence.</p><h3> 4. Celebrate the successes.</h3><p> <br/> The scarf is almost done, and my daughters can clearly see the product of their hard work. With financial planning, it is an ongoing process. Celebrate the small victories and learn from the challenges.

At work, at home, in life, every moment.Folks committed to checking in, not checking out. To being present, not distracted. To being human, not perfect. To showing up without the masks.</p><p> Folks who are successful in life &ndash; and you and I get to define what success is for us &ndash; know how to reflect on their experiences. Sounds obvious, doesn&rsquo;t it? Pretty much every facet of our fast-paced lives, however, conspires against carving out time to self-reflect. And when we reflect, what are we reflecting on? Here&rsquo;s a simple framework for daily reflection that may yield some powerful insights:</p><h3> STOP. CONTINUE. START.</h3><p> <br/> Easy words to remember, right? If they speak to you, why not make them part of your daily self-reflection. In the evening, as you think about what unfolded that day, consider these 3 questions:</p><li> <strong>  What do I want to STOP doing? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What do I want to CONTINUE doing? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What do I want to START doing? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Ask these questions in a spirit of curiosity, not self-flagellation.

{"original_id":4380,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Feel Rich—Even When The Markets Are Down","link":"how-to-feel-rich-even-when-the-markets-are-down","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> When markets are plunging and all the news is bad, it&rsquo;s difficult to stay focused on your current action plan.</h3><p> <br/> Even though the gurus, analysts, pundits, money bloggers, newsletter writers and journalists are bombarding the internet, radio, TV and every other media source with news of the next collapse, you can get through it if you boldly follow these six rules.</p><h3> 1. Maintain a rational amount of liquid savings for unexpected emergencies. </h3><p> <br/> The kitchen appliance that fails, the sudden dental procedure or the broken-down car that must be dealt with can all be handled without cashing in a portfolio&mdash;or heaven-forbid&mdash;your 401(k) plan. Take a measure of your insurance policies (medical, auto, homeowners or renters, disability, etc.) and total the deductibles and co-insurance liability. If you work in an industry with less job security than you would like, consider how much money you&rsquo;d need to stay afloat until you land a new position&mdash;days, weeks or months. Be conservative and make sure your savings will get you through that transition.</p><h3> 2. When it comes to your investments, be sensible. </h3><p> <br/> If you are investing money you need in the next five years or so&mdash;say for a down payment on a house, or to pay for a wedding or a car&mdash;you simply cannot put that money in stocks, no matter how &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; they are. The risk far outweighs the potential gains. If it makes you miserable to see that money earning near zero, think about how you&rsquo;d feel if the money you were counting on is reduced by a big number in a down year. Or two or three. Yes, you will forgo the upside, but the volatility that exists in the global market place is just too big to be considered sensible.</p><h3> 3. Stop checking your accounts frequently. </h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re invested sensibly for the long term&mdash;think asset class investing or indexing&mdash;why bother? If you&rsquo;re in your 30&rsquo;s or 40&rsquo;s and you&rsquo;re checking your retirement account, you&rsquo;ll either feel good or bad. But either emotion is wasted since the value on your statement is completely irrelevant to your long-term expected outcome. The same holds true&mdash;regardless of your age&mdash;if you expect to extract money in retirement as a stream of payments over time vs a lump sum.</p><h3> 4. Take stock of what you&rsquo;re doing right. </h3><p> <br/> If you are working from a well-conceived financial plan, than you should feel pretty darn good that you&rsquo;re following a path that considers your goals, risk tolerance, time horizon and&mdash;most especially&mdash;your values. That is something to celebrate in a big way! It&rsquo;s like the syllabus your teacher handed out on the first day of class. It described what the class was going to cover, what materials you needed, the action steps required and the outcomes. The only difference in a properly built financial plan is that you are the creator in concert with your planner.</p><h3> 5. Feel good about your success. </h3><p> <br/> When you&rsquo;re on a path that aligns with what is most important to you and your family, it&rsquo;s empowering. You&rsquo;re providing comfort and richness&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t left what&rsquo;s really important to chance. And it&rsquo;s vital to feel that richness in your life</p><h3> 6. Keep at it. </h3><p> <br/> Life has a way of bringing events and situations that necessitate adjustment and resilience: a new baby, a lost job, a bonus, an illness, a new spouse or an untimely death or divorce. You&rsquo;ll want to continue to amend and update your plan to reflect your situation, experience and beliefs.</p><p> When the markets are swinging wildly and you&rsquo;re bombarded with words like &ldquo;recession&rdquo;, &ldquo;plunges&rdquo;, &ldquo;turmoil&rdquo; and &ldquo;free-fall&rdquo; just know that there is nothing you can do about it. AND, any action you take in terms of your investment portfolio is probably wrong.</p><p> If you have a plan in place that includes an appropriate liquid side fund, you can ignore the babble and live your life, celebrating your unwillingness to buy into the hysteria. Knowing that you can get through temporary market turmoil will enhance your ability to feel rich indeed.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-28 15:46:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-28 15:46:34.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Tu1IyZy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-feel-rich-even-when-the-markets-are-down/\", \"post_id\": \"9491\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-28 15:46:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-28 15:46:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-feel-rich-even-when-the-markets-are-down\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9490\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4548\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-To-Feel-Rich\\u2014Even-When-The-Markets-Are-Down.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"575\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456741800,"author_id":343,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4381,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Content Marketing Road to Damascus: Are We There Yet?","link":"the-content-marketing-road-to-damascus-are-we-there-yet","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/nicola-michel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nicola Michel  </a> </u></p><p> When it comes to content marketing in financial services, the conversation has moved on significantly from the &lsquo;why&rsquo; of a few years ago to the &lsquo;how&rsquo;; specifically, how to optimise a content marketing strategy to achieve measurable results and improve ROI. <strong>  A lot has changed in those few years and there have been more than a few &ldquo;Road to Damascus&rdquo; moments on the way. </strong></p><p> The first big milestone on that road was the realisation that effective content marketing relies on social media; and vice versa. Stating the obvious? Just a few short years ago marketers and communicators were hard-pressed to sell either concept, let alone sell it as one intrinsically linked feature that should form an integral part of any marketing or communication strategy.</p><p> Against that backdrop, we thought we&rsquo;d take a look at what we (and others) have been saying about content marketing and social media in that time to see exactly how far we&rsquo;ve come.</p><p> What we found was surprising, even for those of us who&rsquo;ve long embraced the content and digital revolution and its implications for our financial services clients.</p><h3> Three years ago business was actively rejecting social media</h3><p> <br/> In the middle of 2012, the Australian Financial Review declared that &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/business/accounting/accounting-firms-have-no-business-on-facebook-20120724-j27eo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Accounting firms have no business on Facebook  </a> </u> &rdquo;, and asked what on earth a social media campaign could possibly offer clients of a financial services firm. The crux of the argument was that B2C communication strategies might benefit from social media, but that it has no place in a B2B strategy.  Our  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/social-media-for-b2b-why-its-the-content-that-counts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   view  </a> </u>  then (and now) is that social media can and should be used to distribute compelling, consistent and valuable content, and that it can be just as effective in financial services as in any other business. </p><p> By September 2012, BlueChip had attended the Content Marketing World masterclass in New York, and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/content-marketing-world-nyc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   shared  </a> </u>  the lessons we learned there. Back then, content marketing was described as a &lsquo;buzzword&rsquo;, presenters were &lsquo;trailblazers&rsquo;, and we were highlighting the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/old-wine-new-bottle-or-brand-new-variety/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   benefits  </a> </u>  of helping our clients in a &lsquo;new&rsquo; way, through content marketing.</p><p> In early 2015, the world had moved on enough that we were less focused on what content marketing is and more on how to help our clients use it to improve their business results, collating  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/the-top-five-of-the-top-five-in-content-marketing-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the best tips  </a> </u>  from an analysis of the most shared, most liked articles on the subject.</p><p> In fact, it&rsquo;s incredible how quickly some of the early adopters (including BlueChip, by the way!)have moved from big picture concept to the nitty gritty.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/10-dos-and-10-donts-to-optimise-your-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Now  </a> </u>  our conversations tend to be so far beyond the &lsquo;why&rsquo; that they delve instead into the brave new world of content optimisation, including how best to optimise images, ensure page load times are lightning fast, and exploring the mysteries of meta descriptions. Not to mention highlighting the importance of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/content-distribution-for-financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   distribution  </a> </u> .</p><h3> So where are we now?</h3><p> <br/> Our understanding of the moving parts of content marketing is now greater than it&rsquo;s ever been. We have a better understanding of the benefits (or otherwise) of different social channels and what formats work best with what audiences. Of whether infographics are more effective than video, or if we should be using Twitter or LinkedIn (or both) for particular audiences. Or what works best to attract customers, and what&rsquo;s best to retain them.</p><p> At its heart however, the central message of content marketing remains the same. And that, dear readers, is the &lsquo;why&rsquo; &ndash; something we should be coming back to time and again to help keep us on the straight and narrow of the road and not the side track.</p><p> We sometimes lose sight of the rationale and purpose of content marketing in our excitement about the discoveries we&rsquo;ve made along that road.</p><p> So here it is, folks. Put simply, content marketing is taking thought leadership, or any other compelling story or content about your brand to your audience in a way that delivers them something they want and value. Which means they begin to value and appreciate your brand. (And that something is not always &ndash; in fact, almost never &ndash; a product or service.)</p><p> Why? To  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/an-idiots-guide-to-the-perfect-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   paraphrase an old journo  </a> </u>  (because we&rsquo;re all still human), one way or another, it&rsquo;s still all about the story.

Maybe That Is What Advisers Are Not Doing Well","link":"being-there-maybe-that-is-what-advisers-are-not-doing-well","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I&rsquo;ve just been reading through a very interesting piece of research that came out of the last census here in NZ, compiled by Statistics NZ, and it immediately highlighted some problems in our process as advisers that suggest we may be missing the mark with many consumers. The key statistic that matters for the purpose of this post is that 7 out of 10 adult consumers in the country experienced a significant change in circumstances in the previous year.</p><p> <strong>  Change of employment, housing, family circumstances, illness&hellip;these were the key contributors to what was determined by the consumers themselves as significant changes. </strong> 70% of them across the country&hellip;.and they are not turning to professionals for help usually.  The overwhelming majority turn to their social networks &ndash; friends, family, work colleagues and community members &ndash; for assistance before turning to professionals.</p><p> At the same time the noise levels over the &ldquo;underinsurance&rdquo; issue, and the &ldquo;lack of financial literacy&rdquo;, and the lack of engagement in obtaining professional advice on the part of consumers has risen significantly from the financial services industry.</p><h3> So what are we to make of the fact that the industry says too few are engaging with us, yet the actual experience of the consumers is that the overwhelming majority are experiencing significant changes in their lives that would appear to warrant some professional advice in many cases?</h3><p> <br/> I suspect that the disconnect between consumers day-to-day experiences where professional advice could be beneficial, and them actually thinking of us, is more about top-of-mind-awareness than anything else.  They simply do not think of us as a potential solution or source of help.  It quite possibly isn&rsquo;t an issue of &ldquo;literacy&rdquo; per se, as consumers seem to be able to figure out well enough when something is significant and they might need help, and then they mostly to go to their families and support networks for that help.</p><p> This line of thought reminded me of a fabulous book called &ldquo;Fish&rsquo;, which was about how a very ordinary business was excelling and doing extraordinarily well. <strong>  A fish market in Seattle of all things, that was selling precisely the same stock to the same customers in the same locality as 2 other fish markets. </strong>  Yet it was doing something like 3 x the turnover.</p><h3> One of the keys to it&rsquo;s success was &ldquo;Be there&rdquo;.  </h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The staff were in the moment. They were fully engaged with customers. They were having fun at work and expressing themselves. </strong> They made noise in a fun way , and let potential customers know they were open for business and happy to engage.  They also let people know they were happy to engage whether people wanted to buy something or not.</p><p> The result was that people went to the fish markets when they wanted to buy fish of course, <strong>  but the majority went to this particular fish market instead of the other two. </strong>  An additional result was that those who didn&rsquo;t want to buy fish today, but would tomorrow, went to this fish market in their lunch hours to be entertained and be part of the atmosphere.   <strong>  Guess where most of those people would buy their next fish from? </strong></p><h3> It doesn&rsquo;t seem too big a stretch of the imagination to me to conclude that one of their secrets &ndash; Being There &ndash; is potentially the financial advisers missing ingredient.</h3><p> <br/> If the majority of consumers have significant life or financial planning requirements changes in any given year, and they are not thinking of or turning to us, then we are simply not present in their minds in the right way.  It may be that they know who we are, and that is a maybe, but clearly they don&rsquo;t have a grasp of what it is we can do to help them.  They are not linking the significant change in life circumstances to our areas of expertise and the positive outcomes we can help create for them.</p><p> It would follow that much of our marketing effort must be about maintaining a constant presence, and creating that top-of-mind-awareness with our potential and existing customers. <strong>  More importantly though, we have to educate and patiently explain, and remind, and remind again, of the types of problems we can help resolve and the sorts of outcomes we can help them achieve. </strong>  We have to work diligently and patiently at creating the sense of &ldquo;being there&rdquo; if we want them to turn to us when significant changes happen in their lives.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-28 16:34:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-28 16:34:27.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_zmOf179.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/being-there-maybe-that-is-what-advisers-are-not-doing-well/\", \"post_id\": \"9494\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-28 16:34:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-28 16:34:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"being-there-maybe-that-is-what-advisers-are-not-doing-well\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9493\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4550\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Being-There.-Maybe-That-Is-What-Advisers-Are-Not-Doing-Well.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"594\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456773300,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4383,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Four Ways You Are Making Your Employees Feel Small","link":"four-ways-you-are-making-your-employees-feel-small","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Good leaders make people feel that they&rsquo;re at the very heart of things, not at the periphery.&rdquo;&mdash;Warren Bennis </strong></p><p> Without even realizing it, you may be making your employees feel small. Too many leaders let their ego, pride, and hidden agendas get in the way of doing what is best for the employees they are supposed to be serving. You can&rsquo;t succeed alone and making employees feel small is one of the quickest ways to disengage and disenfranchise the very people who have the skills and abilities you need. Learn to recognize these four leadership behaviors that make your employees feel small.</p><h3> Your ego is front and center</h3><p> <br/> Your attitude, as a leader, has a huge impact on your employees. When your ego is front and center, your attitude will belittle employees making them feel small. Your ego screams that you identify yourself with power and superiority. It separates you from your employees rather than building community and cohesion.</p><h3> You micromanage</h3><p> <br/> Nothing appears to demonstrate a lack of trust more than micromanagement. When employees do not feel you have confidence in their abilities to do their jobs, it makes them feel small. But, if you are micromanaging, chances are it says more about you than it does about your employee&rsquo;s abilities. One of the most important tasks of a leader is to make sure teams work well together and that employees feel engaged and valued. People need to feel competent and in control of their own work. Micromanagement undermines relationships, trust, engagement, performance, and loyalty.</p><h3> You focus on their shortcomings</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s important to employees that their work is significant and that they are making a meaningful contribution. When you focus on the shortcomings of your employees you make them feel that their contributions are not of value and this, in turn, makes them feel small. While it is not beneficial to overlook subpar performance, employees must see that you take as much notice of good performance as you do poor. As a leader, it is your responsibility to help employees overcome their shortcomings, not to continually rub their faces in them.</p><h3> You have hidden agendas</h3><p> <br/> When employees get the feeling that you are less than transparent and are operating based on hidden agendas, it tells them that you do not trust them enough to include them in the true agenda. This builds a culture of distrust that makes employees feel small. Hidden agendas make employees feel vulnerable and prevent the team from being able to work together toward shared goals. Your agenda should always be a shared agenda; hidden agendas never achieve positive results.</p><h3> Start Making Employees Feel Valued</h3><p> <br/> If you are ever going to succeed as a leader, you must stop making your employees feel small and start making them feel valued. Keep your ego out of it. Your employees need to see that your leadership is about them, not you. Stop micromanaging. Give you employees the training and support that they need and then let them do their jobs. Stop focusing on their shortcomings. Make sure that you acknowledge their strengths and help them to overcome their weaknesses. And, get rid of the hidden agendas. Develop a shared agenda where every employee is working toward the same goals. Your employees will perform to the level that your behavior tells them they should work at; stop making them feel small!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-28 16:49:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-28 16:49:13.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_QhZmMCt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-ways-you-are-making-your-employees-feel-small/\", \"post_id\": \"9496\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-28 16:49:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-28 16:49:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-ways-you-are-making-your-employees-feel-small\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9495\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4551\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Four-Ways-You-Are-Making-Your-Employees-Feel-Small.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"816\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456772400,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

The influx of opportunity helps RIAs enhance their overall strategy and engage with prospective clients, while also offering a real-time read of their return on investment.</p><h3> <strong>  So what are some of the &ldquo;new age&rdquo; approaches the fastest growing RIAs are using? </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Writing thoughtful and engaging content</h3><p> <br/> Creating your own blog has become the norm for RIAs serious about establishing their voice in the marketplace. The owned platform enables you to share timely insight and commentary on issues important to clients, prospects and referral sources. Through a blog you control everything including the visuals, content, point of view and overall message. This allows RIAs to establish a unique style and thought leadership on issues most relevant to potential clients and partners. Blogging is also a timely way to keep current clients up to date with relevant company and industry news.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fortpittcapital.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fort Pitt Capital  </a> </u> , a client of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u> , does a great job  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fortpittcapital.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   demonstrating thought leadership  </a> </u>  on retirement planning, market navigation and other subjects relevant to their targeted audience. Their page also allows visitors to easily access a bevy of content on different topics by clicking on the wealth management, investments, asset allocation and community involvement tabs clearly displayed at the top of the screen.</p><p> More importantly, a blog serves as the core for all marketing and communications efforts. It can be syndicated in email campaigns, on social media feeds and in newsletters, which expands its reach and makes it a worthwhile long-term investment.</p><h3> Leveraging today&rsquo;s social platforms </h3><p> <br/> New social media platforms seem to crop up almost overnight, but the &lsquo;originals&rsquo; &ndash; LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook &ndash; continue to hold their ground as the leaders, and each can play a role in your marketing plan. They all offer the opportunity to increase visibility with clients, prospects and key referral sources, as well as bolster your presence in the industry. Each platform offers access to a different audience. Facebook and Twitter tend to play especially well with individuals. If targeting businesses is your goal, LinkedIn might be the choice for you. But  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/uncategorized/top-takeaways-from-the-fpas-nexgen-business-development-panel/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   as we&rsquo;ve discussed in the past  </a> </u> , all these channels should work together to build your brand and differentiate your practice.</p><p> Coordinating efforts on a variety of platforms can easily become overwhelming from an execution standpoint, not to mention compliance. Thankfully, there are a number of resources and tools available to streamline the process of managing multiple social media feeds, such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://hearsaysocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hearsay Social  </a> </u>  (which is designed specifically for financial services),  <u>  <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://sproutsocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sprout Social  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Building an email marketing campaign</h3><p> <br/> Snail mail has fallen out of vogue given the quick, easy and affordable nature of email as a way to connect and monitor outreach. But merely using email isn&rsquo;t enough. RIAs must make sure their content is packaged in a visually appealing way to avoid getting lost in already overflowing inboxes. With email marketing, less is more. Create a plan and be strategic about what message you are communicating and how often. Be both reactive and proactive with the content you share, and see what garners the best results. Tracking results and implementing the findings is also key to future success. While data monitoring may sound like a daunting task, there are affordable and easy-to-use options out there to help, such as  <u>  <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MailChimp  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Constant Contact  </a> </u> .</p><p> Now more than ever, opportunities exist to bring your firm&rsquo;s brand awareness to the next level by taking advantage of blogging, social media and email marketing. Chances are tomorrow will bring another marketing platform to consider, so keep your eyes open and stay curious about what new services you can add to your arsenal.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-28 17:00:50.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-28 17:00:50.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Vs05pXI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-the-fastest-growing-rias-are-marketing-themselves/\", \"post_id\": \"9497\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-28 17:00:50\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-28 17:00:50\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-the-fastest-growing-rias-are-marketing-themselves\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9498\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4552\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-the-Fastest-Growing-RIAs-Are-Marketing-Themselves.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"699\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456748100,"author_id":235,"chart_url":""}

Marketers can&rsquo;t view them as a vehicle to &ldquo;get picked up by the Wall Street Journal&rdquo; and solicit coverage by other mainstream journalists anymore. Social media, direct engagement and curation tools have largely replaced the press release in this avenue. Yet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should turn your back on the press release distribution altogether.</p><p> There are still many benefits, as Daryl Willcox, chairman of DWPub, told  <u>  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/blog/8836-the-death-of-press-release-distribution-services-the-expert-s-view/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eConsultancy  </a> </u> . He explained that &ldquo;social media pick-up&rdquo; and &ldquo;direct to consumer communications&rdquo; function well &ldquo;as part of a concerted, long-term PR or content marketing campaign.&rdquo; Press releases will always have a place in certain complex industries &mdash; like finance and biomedical tech.</p><p> These days, the press release services market is quite crowded, making it difficult for marketers to decide where their money is best spent. To choose the best press release company, industry veteran  <u>  Sarah Skerik </u>  recommends focusing on these four questions:</p><li> <strong>  What websites syndicate your content and will display my news? </strong> (Hint: Industry niche matters!)</li><li> <strong>  How do you measure online distribution? </strong> (Hint: Do impressions indicate potential or actual views?)</li><li> <strong>  Which media do you reach and how? </strong> (Hint: Are industry bloggers included?)</li><li> <strong>  How do you measure media activity and what type of reporting will I receive? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Of course, you&rsquo;ll also want to consider which press releases receive the most social shares and web traffic referrals. You also only want to pay for the level of distribution you need, so the pricing structure will obviously matter as well.</p><p> In our experience, here are eight companies offering the best press release distribution services (along with a few free companies to consider as well!)</p><h3> <strong>  Best Press Release Distribution Sites </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;ve got some capital to spend, the eight widely lauded top press release sites include:</p><h3> <a href=\"http://www.releasewire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   ReleaseWire  </u> </a> <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"releasewire pricing\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/releasewire-pricing.png\"/></p><p> ReleaseWire is our &ldquo;go to&rdquo; press release distribution service. We like ReleaseWire because it&rsquo;s affordable, easy to use and has great reach. It also functions well for clients in a number of different industries.</p><h3> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PR  </a>  <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Newswire  </a> </u></h3><p> <br/> PR Newswire is the top dog when it comes to search engine referral traffic, according to  <u>  traffic trends by ComScore and Experian </u> . It&rsquo;s the oldest (more than 60 years old) and largest (200,000 distribution points) press release company &mdash; but also the most expensive. Some say their Account Manager turnover is high and customer service is little to be desired, although they themselves say they have won &ldquo;more than 20 awards&rdquo; for serving customers with professionalism. Even so, they&rsquo;re still highly recommended by most analysts, especially when it comes to B2C business.  <u>  <a href=\"http://promotions.prnewswire.com/rs/prnewswire/images/2014_Domestic_Pricing_Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The pricing structure  </a> </u>  can be a bit confusing, but ranges from $545 for local distribution beyond $2,000 for national coverage.</p><h3> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/prweb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PR Web  </a> </u>   <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"PR Web Pricing\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pr-web-pricing.png\"/></p><p> PRWeb is one of the better-known press release companies that receives lots of exposure. In a test,  <u>  SteamFeed found </u>  that one of their releases received 57,489 impressions, 1,096 reads, 109 online pickups and 49 desirable interactions. There are five price tiers, ranging from $99 to $369.</p><h3> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BusinessWire  </a> </u> <br/>  </h3><p> BusinessWire, a large but progressive site, has a partnership with PR Web that serves smaller  <u>  <a href=\"http://metzgeralbee.com/our-thoughts/pr-vendors-how-to-choose-the-best-monitoring-media-database-and-wire-service-options-for-your-business-part-iii-of-iii/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   B2B companies  </a> </u>  and startups well. For $399, you can get distribution on both PR Web and BusinessWire&rsquo;s US 1 network. They offer good geographic control over distribution markets, multimedia integration, and results tracking as well. As  <u>  <a href=\"http://bigfishpr.com/businesswire-vs-prweb-which-service-should-you-use/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BIGfish Communications  </a> </u>  puts it: &ldquo;With more than 92,000 subscribing journalists and a distribution that goes out to more than 89,000 media outlets, your release is very likely to be seen by a relevant reporter and syndicated in top outlets.&rdquo;</p><h3> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Marketwired  </a> </u></h3><p> <br/> If you need SEO on a budget, you&rsquo;ll find more basic reports and decent local pickup with Marketwired. Their Account Reps are reportedly friendly and their rates are more competitive than PR Newswire and BusinessWire, making it a decent buy for IT industry and local market releases, You can score press release distribution for as little as $150 entry-level.</p><h3> <u>  <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Globe Newswire  </a> </u></h3><p> <br/> This network is ideal for publicly traded corporations and releases focusing on business growth or investing news. Pricing ranges from $150 to $560, so it&rsquo;s a more budget-conscious option that still gives you access to industry-standard tools, multimedia integration capability, mobile optimization and reports. </p><h3> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ereleases.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eReleases  </a> </u></h3><p> <br/> At least  <u>  <a href=\"http://fitsmallbusiness.com/best-press-release-service/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   one press release services review  </a> </u>  insinuates that many bloggers and journalists check out the site, particularly the iReach service. With eReleases, you&rsquo;re guaranteed appearance on at least 100 websites with its Newsmaker service. They employ legit editors, rather than simply skimming through for a misspelled word, and boast a 94% delivery rate (not just bragging about where your release has been submitted.) Plans range from $249 to $499.</p><h3> <a href=\"http://www.cision.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Cision </a></h3><p> <br/> A  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.g2crowd.com/press-release/best-press-release-distribution-fall-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   crowdsourced report from G2 Crowd  </a> </u>  found that Cision ranked highest among the best press release distribution networks for customer satisfaction. One professional explained that Cision &ldquo;makes vital information for PR professionals easily accessible&rdquo; &mdash; so it&rsquo;s easy to keep contact information, preferences and outlet information organized in one place. Added perks include free webinars and permanent archiving. Analytics data is another strong suit for Cision&rsquo;s press release service. However, with a price starting at $5,700 annually, Cision is one of the more expensive newswires out there.</p><h3> <a href=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pr.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"pr\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pr.png\"/> </a></h3><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.pr.co/post/108825558122/what-can-we-learn-from-50k-press-releases\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Blog.pr.co  </a> </u></p><h3> BONUS: Best Free Press Release Distribution Sites</h3><p> <br/> Many marketers want to know: &ldquo;Are free press release services worth using?&rdquo;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/article-marketing/free-press-release-websites/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smart Insights  </a> </u>  looked into this query and found a few points worth mentioning that could sway your decision.

{"original_id":4386,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"5 Ways to Effectively Manage Your Emotions During Divorce","link":"5-ways-to-effectively-manage-your-emotions-during-divorce","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  Divorce is by far one of the most stressful and unsettling events that can occur in a person&rsquo;s life. </strong> It shakes the once-solid foundation of the marriage&mdash;and the family.</p><h3> It disrupts lives, changes routines, and often makes people feel like they are in an emotional spin cycle.</h3><p> <br/> Although it may feel impossible at first, learning how to manage that emotional fray is one of the first steps toward healing your heart and finding peace. The key? Remembering that it&rsquo;s a process&mdash;and one that takes time. Sometimes sadness or anger will get the better of you, and that&rsquo;s ok. What matters most is that you do your best to keep moving forward from wherever you are. These steps can help:</p><h3> Compartmentalize. </h3><p> <br/> Being able to compartmentalize your life is an invaluable skill and it&rsquo;s one that can be learned. Often, when going through a divorce, a person spends an enormous time thinking about all the different aspects of the split. Hours, even days, can be lost. Not only is this behavior detrimental to the recovery process, it rarely provides the mental break and space needed to make clear, rational decisions. Instead, try to place limits on the amount of time you dedicate to divorce thought. In fact, you can even schedule it into your day. For instance, say you&rsquo;re at work and find your mind wandering. Tell yourself you&rsquo;ll come back to the issue for 30 minutes at lunch. It may seem awkward in the beginning, but actually this exercise is a way of reclaiming control. When it&rsquo;s &ldquo;divorce time,&rdquo; have at it&mdash;go all the places you want to go. But when time&rsquo;s up, it&rsquo;s up.</p><h3> Check Yourself. </h3><p> <br/> Learn how to identify your thoughts and emotions. Ask yourself, what are the feelings and thoughts that I am currently experiencing? Where am I in this process? Are my feelings relevant? What purpose do they serve? What is the true meaning behind what I am experiencing? Often times, what we feel is something deeper than what it appears to be. By taking the time to check ourselves &ndash; where we are, where we want to be &ndash; helps keep us centered and present.</p><h3> Practice mindfulness. </h3><p> <br/> This technique helps you learn to recognize and accept your feelings without passing judgment on them. You recognize a thought or emotion, but don&rsquo;t try to analyze it to the bone. Instead, you acknowledge it and then let it go. It can be a very powerful way to alleviate the pain of negative feelings. To learn how to do it, visit <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p><h3> Release expectation. </h3><p> <br/> If you go in thinking that your divorce should be a certain way or that you&rsquo;re wrong for feeling the way you do, you&rsquo;ll set yourself up for a vicious cycle of guilt, self-doubt, and low self-confidence. There is no right or wrong way to feel during a divorce. Expect that there will be days that will simply blindside you. You really will sometimes make two steps forward, only to take three back. When this happens, tell yourself that it&rsquo;s ok and all part of the process. This simple reminder is can give you just enough space so you have room to accept your feelings and move on from there.</p><h3> Focus on the big picture. </h3><p> <br/> In the moment, it might feel good to be lost in your emotions. And there is a benefit to being truly present for them. However, part of the journey through divorce is also setting new long-term goals&mdash;and practicing visualization is a good way to do it. Here&rsquo;s what to think about: What do you want your future to look like? How will you know when you have arrived? What steps (big and small) might you take to get there?

So, there is definitely a theme of consistency. It seems many of you continue to be prioritising making a measurable commercial difference in your businesses and investing in your own leadership ability.</p><h3> Alongside that consistency, there is also more variety in goals selected this year. <br/>  </h3><p> After the top two, a wider range of options have been chosen for joint third place. This perhaps reflects both the growing diversity of our readers and the greater breath and diversity in their roles.</p><p> Having talked to many insight leaders over the last year, especially across Financial Services, it seems no one  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/org-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   preferred structure  </a> </u>  of  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/polls/planning-for-your-growing-team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   resourcing model  </a> </u>  has emerged. There are leaders with a primarily database-marketing, analytics, data or research focus, fewer with combinations of those remits &amp; many with other responsibilities in their &lsquo;mix&rsquo; (like BI, reporting, risk, customer experience, strategy or operational efficiency).</p><p> It seems clear that the Customer Insight Leader role is still in a state of flux.</p><p> But let&rsquo;s get to those goal choices. What have most of your peers chosen as their goals for 2016?</p><h3> Your top two choices (with 17% each) are: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Improved measurable commercial impact from applying insights. </strong>  Hopefully some of our content to date on  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/?s=marketing+effectiveness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   measuring marketing effectiveness  </a> </u>  has helped, as well as advice on  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/i-want-to-make-changes-but-they-demanding-a-business-case/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business cases  </a> </u> . I will look to include more content on both measurement &amp; financial measures in future months.</li><li> <strong>  Your leadership. </strong> Continuing to invest in developing your own leadership capability is also a theme I&rsquo;ve heard in conversation with leaders. Sadly, it seems many struggle to get internal support/funding for the leadership coaching which would help them most. But, meanwhile, I hope content here on  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/?s=coaching\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   coaching  </a> </u>  &amp;  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/?s=leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   leadership  </a> </u>  themes is helpful. <br/>  </li><h3> Those interesting third choices (with 11% each), span 5 different goals: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Improvements in technical capability across your team. </strong> Given the growing focus on Data Science &amp; the increasingly technical expectations of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/data-scientists-need-a-better-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data scientist role  </a> </u> , this is not a surprise. Many businesses will find the candidates they recruit don&rsquo;t possess all the technical skills they need or are unfamiliar with the commercial software used in their business. Despite the amount of content on this blog about softer skills, leadership development, strategy &amp; customer focus &ndash; technical excellence does still matter. Hopefully some of our content on  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/need-know-machine-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   tool  </u>  s </a> , especially those to help with  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/round-up-of-data-insight-news/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data visualisation  </a> </u>  or  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/will-microsoft-own-the-research-toolkit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   newer research methods  </a> </u>  is helping.</li><li> <strong>  Specific goal(s) related to analytics. </strong> This appears to align closely with the one above. Particularly amongst FS firms, many appear to still be seeking to increase their use of analytics across the business, facing new business challenges as they go. To help these analysts be effective in achieving business goals, I recommend looking at both the  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/planning-your-analysis-with-a-model-for-greater-value/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   9-step-model summary  </a> </u>  and consider  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/are-softer-skills-for-analysts-being-neglected/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the softer skills  </a> </u>  as well as technical excellence they will need to influence senior stakeholders.</li><li> <strong>  Improved measurable customer experience improvement from applying insights. </strong> I&rsquo;m glad to see this goal complementing the one focussed on measurable commercial outcomes. In my experience the maximum profitable growth comes from keeping your focus on both impacting this year&rsquo;s commercials with insight &amp; improving customer experiences for longer term retention &amp; customer development. Hopefully our  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/?s=customer+experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   customer experience  </a> </u>  content, especially from  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/?s=guest+blogger\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guest bloggers  </a> </u> , is helping you with that.</li><li> <strong>  Balance in your life. </strong>  With so much media coverage of people&rsquo;s desire for work-life balance, or the impossibility of achieving this, it would be surprising not to see this. Plus, it&rsquo;s really important to achieving all the other goals. If you are burnt out or depressed, you are much less likely to achieve the others. For that reason, I&rsquo;ll continue to share a wider range of more holistic leadership content to help in this regard; like recent theme on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/are-you-getting-enough-for-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   importance of sleep  </a> </u>  for leaders.</li><li> <strong>  Stakeholder management. </strong> This last of the 5, is also critical to customer insights being acted upon to improve those commercial numbers or customer scores. Without the ability to effectively manage &amp; influence stakeholders, too many times insights end up back on the shelf without the decisions needed being taken. Hopefully, some of the content on  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/insight-leaders-project-failures/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   managing stakeholder in projects  </a> </u>  &amp;  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/can-influence-top-table/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   influencing senior leaders  </a> </u>  has been helpful. This feels like another theme where I will look to bring in more content. <br/>  </li><p> What do you think? Do you agree? If not, there is still time to vote with your goals or let me know what you will be prioritising this year.</p><p> Good luck with your goals. May you have a successful &amp; effective 2016, a year of which you can be proud! We will check back in on your progress later in the year.</p><p> Do let me know if there is any other content you&rsquo;d like to see, or have to share, to help all our readers on the above topics.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-28 17:43:07.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-28 17:43:07.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_ijfOE1n.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/your-goals-for-2016-keeping-focussed-on-value-growth/\", \"post_id\": \"9504\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-28 17:43:07\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-28 17:43:07\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"your-goals-for-2016-keeping-focussed-on-value-growth\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9503\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4555\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Your-Goals-for-2016-Keeping-Focussed-on-Value-Growth.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"559\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456776000,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4388,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Hewlett-Packard Packs Up Its Innovative Culture","link":"hewlett-packard-packs-up-its-innovative-culture","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When you think of Hewlett Packard, development and manufacturing of computer equipment comes to mind. These days, the company is typically associated with the tech industry. <strong>  Never would you think that its initial revenue stream came from the first electronic shock jiggler fat machine. </strong> The company can be credited for creating products ranging from medical equipment to audio oscillators, from welding equipment to public address systems. What made the company successful was not the range of products it created, but rather what became known as the HP way -  <a href=\"http://www.inflexion-point.com/Blog/bid/74097/5-Timeless-Principles-Revisiting-the-HP-Way\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   five fundamental principles  </u> </a>  that drove the company forward.This ideology reflected the personal core values of the co-founders, Bill Hewlett and David Packard. These values would extend into a comprehensive set of operating practices, business strategies and cultural norms. In 1937, Hewlett Packard exemplified the power of building a company based on a framework of principles. Today, we take these beliefs for granted, but when they were first conceived they were visionary - and - quite radical at the time.</p><h3> <strong>  The HP Way </strong></h3>From the beginning, Hewlett and Packard rejected the &ldquo;hire and fire&rdquo; management style of the early 60s and 70s. David Packard once said:<strong> &ldquo;A company has a responsibility beyond making a profit for stockholders; it has a responsibility to recognize the dignity of its employees as human beings, to the well-being of its customers, and to the community at large.&rdquo;</strong>Most entrepreneurs ask the question &ldquo;How can I succeed?&rdquo; From day one, Packard and Hewlett pursued a different question &ldquo;What can we contribute?&rdquo; This alone helped the company attain extraordinary success. In turn, this enabled the company  to invest more into contributing, which, for a while, created a &lsquo;contribution to success&rsquo; cycle. This belief of &lsquo;contribution&rsquo; extended to Hewlett Packard&rsquo;s employees, who were given stock options, allowed to work four day work weeks, and treated as family members. Hewlett&ndash;Packard invented strategies such as, 'flextime', and 'quality cycles'. Always aware of the needs of its employees, Hewlett&ndash;Packard achieved massive growth that far outshone its competitors' wavering fortunes, even with radically different products from those responsible for its initial boom. If you think Google was the first company to allow its employees to spend a portion of their own time working on their own projects, think again. HP gave its employees the freedom to innovate and to explore without hindrance. This led to a wave of cutting edge products, such as the printer, the calculator, the scanner and the world's first desktop computer. As one <u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2000/10/19/1019malone.html\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes </a></u> journalist said:<strong> &ldquo;I started to understand the key to the greatness of Bill Hewlett and David Packard. They held no attachment to things, only people. Audio oscillator and thousands of other products&ndash;all abandoned in the endless pursuit of something better. Only the people remained, and they were cherished and respected, far more than by any corporation in history&rdquo;</strong>Today, the &lsquo;HP Way&rsquo; is seen as a model for corporate culture, and many firms have tried to imitate the model by adopting measures such as stock options, innovative work rules and team-work, but none were able to emulate what HP had. According to Bill Packard, one key element to the company was the pioneering policy of Management by Objective (MBO). David Packard <u> <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/14299761\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  said </a></u>:<strong> &ldquo;No operating policy has contributed more to Hewlett-Packard&rsquo;s success than the process of MBO. This gave our people the flexibility to work toward goals in ways that they determined best for their own areas of responsibility&rdquo;</strong>In the process of MBO, overall objectives are clearly stated and agreed upon. People are given the freedom to reach the overall goals in whichever way they please. Defining MBO&rsquo;s hinges on the entire organisation agreeing on what each manager should be working toward and then breaking that down into what their teams, and what individuals should be doing. The management team then monitors a range of performance measures, designed to help stay on the correct path towards its objectives (either bi annually or annually).<h3> <strong>  HP loses its way </strong></h3>Today the modern Hewlett Packard is a ghost of what it once was. In the late 90s, the company brought on its first outsider CEO, Carly Fiorina. This marked a turning point for what was the most innovative and disruptive company the world had seen.During her tenor as CEO, Carly Fiorina started dismantling the &lsquo;HP Way&rsquo;, as the company had become complacent and, consensus driven decision making was hindering company growth. Shortly after she had arrived, she began making major changes to employee benefits. The company replaced the profit sharing benefit scheme, for a bonus award system whereby employees would only receive additional funds provided the company met financial expectations. What&rsquo;s more, she removed a number of employee back office functions and cut the product lines from eighty four, to twelve. She implemented dysfunctional operating practices, such as management by walking around, which meant managers would randomly &lsquo;pop in&rsquo; and check to see the employee was doing his or her work. One executive <u> <a href=\"http://web1.calbaptist.edu/dskubik/fiorina.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  explained </a></u>,<strong> &ldquo;The feeling was, here was Carly, who wasn&rsquo;t a long time in the HP culture, who doesn&rsquo;t understand our business and the HP Way, and doesn&rsquo;t understand our strengths, particularly in businesses that were viewed as so successful for so long.&rdquo;[...] &ldquo;The HP we knew is gone&rdquo;</strong>Another mistake Carly made was the merger between HP and Compaq. The companies were built on values that were polar opposites of each other. Hewlett Packard had a culture of consensus decision making, engineering focused and sales driven. Compaq was built on a culture of rapid decision making. The poor fit resulted in nine years of bitter internal fights, and an estimated loss of <u> <a href=\"https://resources.globoforce.com/globoforce-blog/6-big-mergers-that-were-killed-by-culture-and-how-to-stop-it-from-killing-yours\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  thirteen billion dollars </a></u>. Culture clashing can be a large stumbling block when attempting to create a profitable merger. In a recent Society for Human Resources Management <u> <a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/corporate-culture-can-break-or-make-a-merger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study </a></u>, it found that HR professionals listed incompatible cultures as among the biggest obstacles to success. Companies may go in and do due diligence, look at finances, think it's a good market fit. But, in reality the culture and people issues cause the demise of a successful merger.When mergers occur, not every aspect can be controlled. Having a culture where employees know and understand each other can protect the company from many bumps and bruises that occur. It&rsquo;s important the company protects its core values. Before the merger, the executives must understand how the values of each company will fit together. At Hewlett Packard, the company's core value meant innovating, and contributing. According to a <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/96663370/The-Soul-of-an-Organization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Gallagher study </u>  </a>&ldquo;an organisation that reinforces it core value is more likely to be successful then those that don&rsquo;t. When a company, like Hewlett packard, fails to integrate these core values into their way of business, it eventually fails. Employees from every department must understand the core values the company believes in.Mergers can be disruptive to employee workflows. When companies merge, it generally calls for a management reshuffle. This destabilizes the hierarchical structure and drains employee confidence. During this delicate stage, it&rsquo;s important that managers listen to employees&rsquo; concerns and problems. Open up communication channels and allow employees to be heard. Nothing is worse for team morale than lack of communication. <a href=\"http://www.impraise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Impraise</a> facilitates the communication between manager and employee. What&rsquo;s more, through anonymity, the platform facilitates open and honest discussions. Hewlett Packard&rsquo;s problem was that the company was not listening to its employees, which <u> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2012/05/08/how-hewlett-packard-lost-its-way/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  resulted </a></u> in very low engagement levels across every department. It's important to encourage the forging of relationships between  companies when a merger occurs. Make it possible for employees to recognize and appreciate their team members.","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-28 18:06:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-28 18:06:24.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_O5ZqpSd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/hewlett-packard-packs-up-its-innovative-culture/\", \"post_id\": \"9506\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-28 18:06:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-28 18:06:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"hewlett-packard-packs-up-its-innovative-culture\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9505\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4556\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hewlett-Packard-Packs-Up-Its-Innovative-Culture.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"898\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456765200,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

Both can cause problems for you and your team.</p><p> That said, \"excellence in edginess\" was demonstrated to me -- as the recipient -- early in my own work history.</p><p> Before I became a coach, I was a corporate exec. At one point in my career I was managing a multimillion dollar project that had hit some major stumbling blocks. Out of the blue, my boss's boss got on the elevator I was on. It was just the two of us. After a few floors, she looked me in the eyes and said, \"I hear your project hit a big snag.\" She paused, and I nodded yes, and she added, \"We both know too many people who left this place on rails when they over-promised and under-delivered. I'd hate to lose you that same way.\" Pause. Wow. \"Make it work, and let me know what you need.\" Silence. Ding. Off she went.</p><p> It worked. While it was hard to hear, I took it as \"fuel\" to get my project back on track. It worked because it was in character for her (e.g., authentic), and she offered both consequences and support. It was neither mean nor rude. It was clear.</p><p> These days I'm often presented with executive clients who've yet to master their sharper edge skills, and instead have gotten feedback about being too mean or too \"needing to be liked.\" I've worked with a lot of people on this, and have found the common factors that help with both styles. They've helped my clients, and can work for you too:</p><h3> 1. Use toughness sparingly.</h3><p> <br/> In the example, she wasn't constantly prodding or micromanaging me me given the issues in my project. It was a sharp sting, but one that needed only be delivered once. It's 15 years later and I still remember it verbatim.</p><h3> 2. Deliver it privately.</h3><p> <br/> No one else was on the elevator. It was NOT in front of a group, my team, her team or anyone else. It was one-on-one, which is the way I recommend my clients deliver critical or even tough messages. Praise in public, punish in private, as the saying goes.</p><h3> 3. Be thoughtful and deliberate -- and not reactive -- about it.</h3><p> <br/> Critical or sharp-edged messages delivered in the heat of reacting to something are always a mistake.

She was the youngest of 13 and has outlived all of her siblings.  She has outlived two of her three sons and has been a widow for 20 years.  Below is a picture of her and my Grandfather Herby long before I came along.  I can&rsquo;t imagine that she ever thought she would live to 90 and be widowed for so many years.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-8.46.16-AM.png\" width=\"583\"/></p><p> I have spent some really nice time with both of my grandmas over the past six months.  Here is a picture of Honey and Marina in 2015.  Honey&rsquo;s parents were both born in Italy and she is the only living child of seven.  Neither Honey nor Marina feels safe driving anymore and they rely on family members and a paid helper to bring them groceries and to take them to their many doctor visits.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-8.46.27-AM.png\" width=\"626\"/></p><p> The last time we went to a restaurant I noticed that neither of them could read the menu.  Someone once said that from 65 to 75 you are in the go-go years of retirement.  75 to 85 is the slow-go years.  After 85 you enter the no-go years. Honey and Marina are definitely in the no-go years and wouldn&rsquo;t accept a free trip to anywhere in the world because of pain from walking, the possibility of danger, and being away from their doctors.</p><p> The longer you live, the greater the chance that you will spend more on healthcare and need some sort of long term care.  According to <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ownyourfuturetexas.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.ownyourfuturetexas.org  </a> </u> there is a 70% chance that someone 65 or older will need long term care and the average private room at a nursing home costs more than $67,000 per year.  Older people also tend to get more and more conservative with their investments and run the risk that their savings will not keep up with inflation.</p><p> In my financial planning practice, I try to be conservative with my assumptions on returns knowing that a client in their 80s may not be willing to keep the 60% stock portfolio they started retirement with.  I also usually run my retirement projections showing people living to 95 or 100, just in case.</p><h3> What can you do to Minimize Longevity Risk?</h3><p> <br/> If you are worried about longevity risk, consider working longer.  65 is just a stupid number that we need to quit anchoring to.  It is not even considered full retirement age for Social Security anymore.  Repeat after me, &ldquo;I am not a loser if I work past 65.&rdquo;  Some of the most successful people in the world like Warren Buffet, Carl Icahn, and T. Boone Pickens are still working in their 80s.  Working longer allows you to save more and reduces the number of years your portfolio will need to sustain you.  It also has the added benefit of keeping you mentally sharp and feeling needed.</p><p> The second best thing to consider is taking Social Security later.  If you die early and your payment is bigger than your spouse&rsquo;s, he or she gets to take over your larger payment for the rest of their life.  Don&rsquo;t think about &ldquo;my&rdquo; Social Security.  This is a joint life decision and an act of love.  If your benefit is $1,000 at age 66, it will be $1,320 at age 70.  If you die early, you didn&rsquo;t have long to blow much money and your kids will still get an inheritance.  The risk is small if you die early in retirement.  You won&rsquo;t remember how nice life was at 62 when you took Social Security early if you make it to 100 and don&rsquo;t have two dimes to rub together.</p><p> You should also consider putting some of your money into either an immediate or a deferred annuity and taking payments for life.  At the time of this writing a 65 year old woman can put $100,000 into an immediate annuity and get a monthly payment of $500 for the rest of her life, even if she lives to 120.  Annuities are the only investments that have mortality credits and can guarantee you a payment for life.</p><p> Getting long term care insurance through traditional long term care or buying a life insurance policy with a good critical care rider can protect you from some of the expenses of long term care.  If you don&rsquo;t insure this risk, you should designate part of your portfolio or another asset like your home as your self-insured long term care plan.</p><p> Lastly, you are going to need to hold some allocation to stocks to try and beat inflation.  When you buy a CD or a bond, you are a loaner and you hope to get interest payments and your principal back at maturity date.  When you buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, you are an owner and get to participate in the future profits of the best companies on earth.  Human progress in my Grandma&rsquo;s lifetimes has been astonishing.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how much life will change over my lifetime with so many talented scientists all connected via the internet.</p><p> Nobody knows when they are going to die, but I recommend that you plan to live a long life because you never know what a biotech company in California is dreaming up to invent to keep you alive past 100.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-29 16:47:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-29 16:47:26.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_SpEX9or.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-is-longevity-risk/\", \"post_id\": \"9511\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-29 16:47:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-29 16:47:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-is-longevity-risk\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9507\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4558\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Know-When-and-How-to-Be-Tough.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"807\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456844400,"author_id":123,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4392,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Rise of the RIA","link":"the-rise-of-the-ria","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How IBD advisors are reconsidering their future in a changing business climate and landscape</h3><p> <br/> The independent broker dealer (IBD) space has experienced a transformation of late, just short of the consolidation we witnessed in the wirehouse world during the financial meltdown of 2008. Today, a changing regulatory environment and an increase in the overall cost of doing business has placed an enormous burden on independent broker dealers, no matter their size. Small broker dealers that lack the scale necessary to invest in their compliance and overall infrastructure are rapidly becoming an endangered species. As a result, mergers and acquisitions in the IBD space abound, and many IBD reps are finding themselves at firms that look nothing like the ones they joined years ago.</p><p> Acquisitions and the consolidation that&rsquo;s ensued have resulted in enormous upheaval for IBD reps, and these advisors are often faced with a home office ill-equipped to support the new larger entity and an overly taxed compliance department focused on managing to the lowest common denominator. These unsettling changes have been the tipping point for many and as business owners, they are taking the opportunity to evaluate their long term business strategy. While some will seek out a new broker dealer offering greater stability, scale and support, others desire an even greater modicum of freedom, flexibility and control and are choosing to launch either a hybrid RIA (for advisors who want to continue capturing revenue from commission business) or an RIA (for advisors with fully fee based practices). The RIA channel has been growing steadily in terms of both headcount and assets under management, with IBD advisors representing a new wave of breakaways. Having built successful, stand-alone businesses, these confident entrepreneurs want true open architecture in order to best serve their clients, greater customization of technology and compliance, a community of like-minded advisors and the final word when it comes to their bottom line.</p><h3> The New Breakaways</h3><p> <br/> For advisors with predominantly fee-based businesses and assets exceeding $100mm, the broker dealer world can be limiting in terms of economics, platform, technology and compliance&mdash;not to mention many advisors have found that their businesses have grown too complex to be supported by this model. IBD&rsquo;s can be expensive &ndash; with many hidden costs &ndash; while advisors often feel constrained as they&rsquo;re limited to a set menu of investment products and often less sophisticated technology. With average rep production in the IBD space hovering around $400,000, broker dealers offer core services designed to serve the smaller advisor. Plus, heavy-handed compliance departments built to manage to the lowest common denominator often create inefficiency, which results in a decrease in productivity for highly successful advisors.</p><p> As an RIA, advisors keep a greater share of their revenue and have complete control over fees and expenses. Advisors who have outgrown the IBD space often require more sophisticated services to meet their clients&rsquo; needs, and access to an open architecture with the ability to leverage the best of what Wall Street has to offer &ndash; allowing RIAs to better customize the client experience. With client assets held safely at a custodian, the advisor sits on the buy side, becoming a client of &ldquo;The Street&rdquo; on behalf of his clients.</p><p> Superior technology, including better CRM and portfolio management systems along with more advanced performance reporting, often top the wish list for advisors contemplating a move. Many find utopia in the RIA world as there&rsquo;s more optionality when it comes to software solutions and greater customization in terms of compliance.</p><p> With greater control over supervisory decisions, RIAs have more flexibility and experience an overall ease of doing business. As a fiduciary, RIAs deliver highly personalized advice and must avoid any conflicts of interest. In this model, advisors offer investment recommendations to their clients and purchase services from a custodian, whereas broker dealers must act in accordance to a suitability standard which in turn imposes limitations on how an advisor can run his business.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s in a Move?</h3><p> <br/> Launching an RIA is not as herculean a task as many perceive it to be. With most of the infrastructure already in place, there are essentially 3 components involved for the IBD business owner transitioning his business to an RIA model:</p><li> <strong>  Custodians:  </strong> Custodial services go beyond holding client assets and choosing a custodian often comes down to identifying the right fit. Custodians will guide advisors as they formulate and execute their business plan and prepare to launch their firm. As business-to-business partners, they provide access to a wide array of investment and banking products, not to mention highly integrated technology solutions. Custodians have to earn &ldquo;their clients&rsquo;&rdquo; business every day and offer ongoing practice management as well as technology and operational support.</li><li> <strong>  Technology:  </strong> Leveraging the best of what the street has to offer, RIAs can pick and choose from a broad array of dynamic technology solutions designed to benefit the needs of their business. Rather than being limited to a technology platform that&rsquo;s one size fits all, customization defines the RIA space and given today&rsquo;s technology is anything but static, advisors will often find software solutions that surpass what they had in the broker dealer world. Whether it be a turnkey package from a custodian or individual systems that &ldquo;talk to&rdquo; one another, advisors will find solutions that are highly integrated.</li><li> <strong>  Legal Support: </strong>  Having spent years relying on a broker dealer for compliance supervision and support, the legal considerations surrounding an RIA practice are often the most daunting for advisors coming out of the broker dealer world. RIAs have far greater autonomy and control over the decisions they make and as such, there are a number of regulatory requirements that must be met. For starters, most RIAs will hire a compliance consultant to walk them through registering their firm with the SEC, filing their Form ADV (the uniform form investment advisors must submit to the SEC that specifies their investment style, assets under management and key officers of the firm) and drafting their compliance manual. As for ongoing supervision, custodians provide some surveillance but most RIAs will hire a compliance consultant. In fact, an entire cottage industry of third-party consultants and experts has been born to support the independent advisor and with superior economics, the cost for these services has minor impact on an RIAs bottom line.</li><li> <strong>  Platform Providers: </strong>  With a greatly evolved independent landscape, there are more turnkey solutions available than ever before. Platform providers such as Dynasty Financial Partners and HighTower Network alleviate much of the heavy lifting by offering access to fully built out, customized platforms that advisors can, for a fee, leverage. <br/>  </li><p> While advisors in the IBD space enjoy many of the benefits of operating independently, a desire for even greater freedom and control has led many to plot a path to the RIA world. Add to that the angst that plagues many in the space who worry that their firm isn&rsquo;t equipped to deal with the changing regulatory environment and who may not have the financial stability to remain competitive. In making the transition to an RIA, advisors should think about it as unbundling the services that their broker dealer provides with the luxury of selecting and paying for only those that they need. While there&rsquo;s indeed some heavy lifting involved, having a well-oiled machine already in place coupled by access to an entire cottage industry of consultants to handle legal, compliance and technology, charting the path to become an RIA is relatively seamless.</p><p> When considering evolution, Charles Darwin stated, &ldquo;It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.&rdquo; The flexibility offered in the RIA space provides advisors with the opportunity to grow and prosper in what&rsquo;s proving to be a highly unsettling business climate.

{"original_id":4394,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Get a Good Night's Sleep ... Hire Well!","link":"how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep-hire-well","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Each role in your firm counts.</h3><p> <br/> It is necessary for the strength of an organization and the well being of your team for individuals to succeed in their role.  Most managers have encountered the challenge of managing a difficult employee at one point or another.  Credibility, hiring mistakes and other items often influence your mental ability to have the courage to deal with difficult situations once you have them. To get in front of this situation consider your hiring practice- I personally believe that hiring well will be the most important thing you can do, but few of us have the time to create the process. </p><p> One way to mitigate problems with employees is to start at the beginning.  Am I hiring correctly?  Do I have the right people in place?  Is there something I can do to change the results I am getting?</p><h3> Begin with the end in mind</h3><p> <br/> Does your job description accurately reflect the role and responsibilities that you are looking for with your potential hires?  Is it consistent with the metrics by which they are being measured?  Does the person understand fully what is expected of them?</p><h3> Strategic Interviewing:</h3><p> <br/> I once worked for an organization that scheduled final rounds of interviews for 30 minutes each with 5 different people.  We all asked basically the same questions.  \"So why are you leaving your company?\"  \"What did you find challenging about your last role?\"  \"Why are you interested in coming here?\"  When we all wound up with the same answers and no new information, we realized that our process 1) Gave the person the opportunity to practice repeatedly the \"good answers\" and 2) Did not allow us to learn anything new about the candidate.  Proper strategic coordination of multiple person interviews are integral to accomplishing the goal of GAINING NEW INSIGHT into that person.  It requires a few things:</p><li> <strong>  A list of what you need to uncover about the candidate </strong> , or what has not been discussed in more detail before a hiring decision can be made.</li><li> <strong>  Divide up the roles for each of the interviewers (or parts of the interview if you are doing this solo) and stick to the discipline for each format.  </strong> Keep it as scripted as possible to keep inexperienced interviewers from asking \"no-no\" questions about age, marital status etc.  Have HR review the list if possible. </li><li> <strong>  Schedule a formal debrief immediately after the interview sessions to capture fresh impressions and gut reactions. </strong>   Little things that people pick up tend to get remembered differently as time passes, and important queues or details could be lost. </li><li> <strong>  Create a uniform grading schedule for each person evaluating the new talent. </strong>   It does not matter if you use a \"recommend\", \"recommend with reservations\", \"not recommend\" system or a 1-10 grading scale, just make sure you are all evaluating the same things, and can prioritize the candidates.</li><li> <strong>  Be fearless when it comes to ratings. </strong>   While you may be under the gun to get a hire, make sure you are objective with the evaluation, and pay attention if you are consistently getting mediocre feedback.   Most candidates are on their very best behavior or extraordinarily polished when interviewing, so I like to incorporate layers of interaction.  I like to see them in informal and formal settings, and learn something personal about them.  While nobody is perfect, you just need to ensure that you have a strong sense for how this person handles adversity, and what motivates them. </li><li> <strong>  Allow yourself the proper time for interviews. </strong>   I strongly recommend spending at least an hour in person (After several phone interviews by a manager or a recruiter).  Have other interviewers spend 45 minutes to one hour with the candidate.  A half hour is too short, and you don't start getting into the good stuff until several minutes into the interview.  <br/>  </li><h3> Manage the Candidate experience:</h3><p> <br/> Lastly, manage the expectations of the candidate for the hiring timeline, and when you will next reach out to them.  You do not want a desirable candidate thinking you don't like them because they haven't heard from you in a week, and thus lose them to a competitor.  Conversely you don't want a candidate that you wish to cut loose calling your team or recruiter every 5 minutes to check in. </p><p> To learn more about us visit us <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-hire-well-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-29 17:58:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-29 17:58:03.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_hViJN8b.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep-hire-well/\", \"post_id\": \"9521\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-29 17:58:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-29 17:58:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep-hire-well\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9520\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4562\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Get-a-Good-Nights-Sleep-...-Hire-Well.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"775\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456854300,"author_id":323,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4395,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Retaining Employees Is Worth the ROI","link":"why-retaining-employees-is-worth-the-roi","source_link":null,"content":"<p> You might think that your organization would be better off letting employees leave so that you can hire new team members at lower salaries, reducing your expenses along the way. You&rsquo;d be wrong. It actually costs a lot more to hire new employees than retain your existing ones &mdash; even if those folks draw ever-increasing salaries.</p><h3> The Cost of Replacing Employees</h3><p> <br/> Swapping employees is nowhere as easy as it sounds. Organizations that are searching for new employees have to devote resources to recruiting and interviewing. When a candidate is finally chosen for the position, they then have to spend time onboarding that individual. Not only does a new hire spend their time learning how to do the job instead of actually doing it, but managers also have to devote their energies into getting rookies up to speed.</p><p> If that weren&rsquo;t enough, organizations are forced to do all that while incurring productivity losses until the new hire can produce at a high level. According to the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/labor/report/2012/11/16/44464/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Center for American Progress  </a> </u> , this all translates into serious costs:</p><li> <strong>  For jobs that pay $30,000 or less, it costs businesses 16.1% &mdash; almost $5,000 &mdash; to replace an employee. </strong></li><li> <strong>  For jobs that pay $50,000 or less, it costs businesses 19.7% &mdash; nearly $10,000 &mdash; to replace an employee. </strong></li><li> <strong>  For jobs that pay $75,000 or less, it costs businesses 20.4% &mdash; more than $15,000 &mdash; to replace an employee. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Notice a trend here? Data isn&rsquo;t available for jobs that pay more than that, but you can safely conclude that the more an employee is paid, the more it costs to replace them. Altogether, the average company spends 12% of its pretax income on rehiring and training new employees, according to an infographic on  <a href=\"https://www.mindflash.com/blog/2012/06/infographic-why-retraining-current-employees-is-cheaper-than-hiring-new-ones/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  retraining employees </a>  from Mindflash. For companies that are impacted by turnover the most, that number jumps to a grotesque 40%.</p><h3> Keep Them Around By ...</h3><p> <br/> Since it&rsquo;s way more expensive to hire new employees than retain your existing ones &mdash; even if you give them hefty raises &mdash; how exactly can you go about convincing your team members to stick around?</p><h3> 1. Giving them a raise</h3><p> <br/> According to our  <u>  Employee Engagement Report </u> , nearly 25% of employees would leave for another position that pays 10% more. Seeing as  the cost of replacing employees is almost certainly more than 10% of their salaries, you&rsquo;d be wise to pay up to match the increase in living wages.</p><h3> 2. Recognizing employee efforts</h3><p> <br/> Our report also found that less than 33% of employees feel valued at their jobs. To increase the likelihood employees will stay put, work on improving that statistic as much as you can at your organization. An easy way to do that is by embracing  <a href=\"https://www.tinypulse.com/blog/sk-18-creative-employee-recognition-ideas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  employee recognition </a>  and expressing gratitude to your amazing workers on a regular basis.</p><h3> 3. Investing in professional development</h3><p> <br/> Another finding from our report revealed that only 25% of employees feel as though their organizations provide ample opportunities for professional development. Employees &mdash; and particularly millennials &mdash; will stick around if you make professional development a top priority.</p><p> The longer your employees stay put, the better they&rsquo;ll be able to serve your customers because they&rsquo;ll know your operations inside and out. For this reason, employee retention should be one of your organization&rsquo;s core points of focus.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-29 18:02:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-29 18:02:01.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_395sWCM.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-retaining-employees-is-worth-the-roi/\", \"post_id\": \"9523\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-29 18:02:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-29 18:02:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-retaining-employees-is-worth-the-roi\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9522\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4563\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Why-Retaining-Employees-Is-Worth-the-ROI.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"764\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456839000,"author_id":416,"chart_url":""}

Not only does it help we with some self-study continuing education credits (CCEUs) to maintain my coaching certification, but  also feeds my deep-rooted need for continuous learning. Unfortunately, this time, I made a poor choice of courses.</p><h3> You may be thinking, So what? Who cares? They&rsquo;re free, Right?</h3><p> <br/> Yes, while you can take just about any course for free, if you want the completion certification certificate (for CCEUs) you need to prove you took the course and passed. Also,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   many MOOCs  </a> </u>  these days are grouped into specializations and unless you pay, you can&rsquo;t take the capstone where all the learning is put into motion.</p><p> Anyway&hellip;</p><p> This time, I paid a substantial amount of money for a five-course specialization from a major well-respected US university. After the first few lessons, I asked for a refund. Why?</p><li> Typos in almost every document</li><li> Mis-coded answers in the quiz (right answers, confirmed as correct by the system are marked as wrong and vice versa)</li><li> Poorly written with nearly impossible to follow questions on the quizzes</li><li> An unresponsive course team that didn&rsquo;t respond to some people pleading for clarification on the first few assignments <br/>  </li><p> Money refunded, I&rsquo;m moving on but I&rsquo;ll never take another online course through this particular university. I trusted that it would be polished, offer great content and if I applied myself have tons of learning. Unfortunately, it was nothing short of a sloppy mess.</p><p> On top of it all, they&rsquo;ve lost my trust. </p><p> I gave them money and trusted I was getting quality. I didn&rsquo;t.</p><p> The course designers probably prioritized getting it out in the world over a QA check; I get it. They likely also assumed that content would trump format. Wrong. Both components needed to be strong to hold a smart learners attention and keep their trust that they made a good investment.</p><p> Think they have any clue that their sloppy approach lost my trust? I&rsquo;m in their target audience, willing to pay, and incredibly engaged yet I&rsquo;m waving bye-bye.</p><p> Got me thinking&hellip;</p><p> When do you and I unintentionally erode trust in different parts of our lives? What small actions and seemingly inconsequential decisions are taking the bonds of trust and throwing them out the door?</p><p> Trust is the cornerstone of all relationships. </p><h3> According to Google&rsquo;s Dictionary: </h3><p> <br/> TRUST</p><p> trʌst/</p><p> noun </p><p> firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something.</p><p> &ldquo;relations have to be built on trust&rdquo;</p><p> Would you willfully wave a flag that says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unreliable, not true to my word and a big believer in telling lies?&rdquo; I highly doubt it.</p><p> Bad news, you may be waving that flag and not even realize it. Assess yourself against the list below and find out.</p><h3> <strong>  12 Ways You&rsquo;re Eroding Trust and Don&rsquo;t Even Know It </strong></h3><h3> <br/> 3 Ways You&rsquo;re Eroding Trust With Family</h3><h3> <br/> Putting off time together for work&hellip; and then putting it off again&hellip; and again</h3><p> <br/> You tell your kids that you&rsquo;ll  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/life-leadership-lego/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  build LEGO tomorrow </a> , got to work tonight. Sadly, tomorrow comes and your child is thrilled it&rsquo;s the big night. You wish you could, but you can&rsquo;t.  Raincheck for tomorrow? Your child loves you and agrees.</p><p> TIP: Never doubt for a moment that they&rsquo;re learning that your word is worth less than that always promised raincheck. The work will still be there in 30 minutes, make time for the people who love you now before they stop asking for good.</p><h3> Using your smartphone in really dumb ways&hellip; i.e. it&rsquo;s always on</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;How was your day?&rdquo; you ask your spouse. During their answer, you check your phone seven times and return two texts. Of course, they were important. Too bad you&rsquo;re showing your spouse that they are far less important than everyone else. &ldquo;Trust me, I love you, you matter,&rdquo; you say.</p><p> TIP: Stop with the empty words and show them.  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/technology-training-wheels/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Leave your phone in the other room </a> . Listen, make eye contact with the person sitting across from you and not a screen for a change.</p><h3> Important meetings at work always trump important meetings in your life</h3><p> <br/> Can&rsquo;t remember the last time you made it to your child&rsquo;s sports game or school event? What about the long-planned date night with your spouse that you have to miss because you have another last minute business trip?</p><p> TIP: You decide how you take control of your schedule; your schedule does not run you. Block out time for life events, not only work events and make them sacred. Show up for the people in your whole life, not only at the office.</p><h3> 3 Ways You&rsquo;re Eroding Trust With Friends</h3><h3> <br/> You promise to be there and you will&hellip; eventually</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait for dinner with you! Seven is perfect!&rdquo; (and you show up at 7:45)</p><p> Your friends talk amongst themselves, you know. When they want you there by 7:45, they tell you 7:00. They also offer to pick you up because the wait for you to show up can be excruciating.</p><p> TIP: Honor your commitments &ndash; that starts with showing up on time. Yes, you may need to cut something else short but you need to ultimately decide  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/life-and-leadership-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  what matters most </a> .</p><h3> Personal emails can wait when you have a billion work emails, right?</h3><p> <br/> You can hardly believe that the email you told yourself you&rsquo;d respond to when you had the time is now six months overdue. They probably understand. I mean, who wants to email at night after doing it all day?</p><p> TIP: If you can&rsquo;t send the long response you want to send, give yourself 48 hours to respond instead of putting it off for weeks that turn into months. Go with: I miss you. Thanks for the note. Super busy but want you to know I got this. Also, put a tickler on your calendar for two weeks out. If still no time for a long follow-up, continue to ping yourself until you get it done.</p><h3> Every time they call, you&rsquo;re magically unavailable</h3><p> <br/> Caller ID is amazing, isn&rsquo;t it? What did we do before you could knowingly avoid someone. (answer: picked up the phone). Bad news, people know when you&rsquo;re ignoring them.</p><p> TIP: You&rsquo;re supposed to be friends, act like it. If you never want to take their call, it&rsquo;s time to re-evaluate your friendship. If you&rsquo;re worried that they want something from you, it&rsquo;s time for you to  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/rekindle-your-confidence-and-creativity-through-self-mentoring/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  do some self-development </a>  and figure out how to turn avoidance into connection.</p><h3> <strong>  3 Ways You&rsquo;re Eroding Trust With Your Colleagues and Team </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Willing to throw people under the bus if it saves your a$$ </h3><p> <br/> If your go-to response is &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it but so and so did,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve got a prob and so does your team.</p><p> TIP: Leaders take responsibility and hold themselves accountable instead of looking for the nearest scapegoat. All you&rsquo;re showing them is that they should trust that you&rsquo;ll pin every failure and misstep on someone else.</p><h3> Only reporting out at team meetings and never opening up the agenda for questions</h3><p> <br/> When weak leaders don&rsquo;t have the answers or are afraid to share, they shut themselves off from questions. People notice when the agenda is so tightly controlled people are shut down and any question raised is met with a scowl and a suggestion you take it off-line.</p><p> TIP: Strong leaders are unafraid to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo; Strong leaders confidently admit when  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/leadership-beyond-illusion-of-perfection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   things are less-than-perfect  </a> </u> . Be a strong leader.</p><h3> Always using the word &ldquo;I&rdquo; when describing your team&rsquo;s contribution in lieu of &ldquo;we&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re the only one representing your team&rsquo;s work in senior leadership meetings, It&rsquo;s easy to slip into I-mode. I had the team do this, I asked for that, I suggested, I created, I envisioned. You get the picture.</p><p> TIP: Even better than &ldquo;we&rdquo;, name the people who put in the time and effort by name. Let them get the credit they deserve.</p><h3> <strong>  3 Ways You&rsquo;re Eroding Trust With Customers </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Unresponsive on social channels where you bothered to set up an account. </h3><p> <br/> Your small business (or big one) set up a profile on Twitter, Facebook, you name it. You even hired someone to constantly fill your stream with relevant posts. The one thing you may have forgotten is engagement with real people, real time, is at the heart of social media.</p><p> TIP: When customers have problems or questions, they reach out to you. No more hanging on the telephone for hours to talk to a real human being. Show them that you  are real and you care about their needs by responding. Social media is not email, (see above) and people don&rsquo;t want to wait days, weeks or longer for a response.</p><h3> Delivering the minimum &ndash; late. </h3><p> <br/> Work plans are best estimates; people understand that there are real reasons for over-runs. It may be that your client asked for an increase in scope or that you discovered the complexity is far greater than anticipated. It may also be that you had other priorities and didn&rsquo;t get to this particular client&rsquo;s deliverable. The choice is to push yourself or ask for more time &ndash; yet again.</p><p> TIP: People love the phrase &ldquo;under promise over deliver&rdquo; for a reason. Never forget,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/25-ways-quiet-heroes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   everything you deliver builds both trust and confidence  </a> </u>  in you, your product, and business or erodes it.</p><h3> Never responding to heartfelt comments on your blog. </h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m guilty as charged. Last week I had ISP issues and literally couldn&rsquo;t do it. (excuses, excuses) Still, it&rsquo;s a great place to let people know that you see them, appreciate them and engage with their insights.</p><p> TIP: Do you best. Be present. Engage. If you can&rsquo;t do it every time, forgive yourself. It&rsquo;s okay and your readers understand that you&rsquo;re human. If you never do it, now&rsquo;s the best time to start.</p><p> Starting today, what is one change that you&rsquo;re going to make to BUILD trust instead of  erode it?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-29 18:18:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-29 18:18:44.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_Tr4FltR.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/12-ways-youre-eroding-trust-and-how-to-stop/\", \"post_id\": \"9529\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-29 18:18:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-29 18:18:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"12-ways-youre-eroding-trust-and-how-to-stop\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9528\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4566\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12-Ways-You\\u2019re-Eroding-Trust-and-How-to-Stop.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"725\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456834500,"author_id":15,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4400,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"8 College Repay Plans – and Counting","link":"8-college-repay-plans-and-counting","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> This was going to be a quick blog post about the new student loan repayment program rolled out by the federal government in January.</h3><p> <br/> But the differences between it and the seven plans that preceded it were too confusing to figure out on a tight deadline.</p><p> This isn&rsquo;t just the view of one cranky blog writer. Craig Lemoine, a financial planning professor and student loan expert at the  <u>  <a href=\"http://ticas.org/blog/new-income-driven-repayment-plan-now-available-all-federal-direct-student-loan-borrowers-repaye\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American College  </a> </u>  of Financial Services, which trains financial planners, also admits to being confused about the repayment options, which keep increasing in number.</p><p> If Lemoine were a student, he asked, &ldquo;How on earth would I know which one to pick?&rdquo;</p><p> His confusion pales in comparison with that of a lovely and loved young member of my family. She&rsquo;s vague on the details of how her own student loans work. Here&rsquo;s a rough approximation of our recent telephone conversation:</p><p> <strong>  Me: </strong> Are your student loans from a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/blog/how-to-pay-off-private-student-loans-from-sallie-mae-and-other-lenders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   private lender  </a> </u>  or the  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans#direct-and-ffel\" target=\"_blank\">   federal government  </a> </u> ?</p><p> <strong>  Family member: </strong> I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p> <strong>  Me: </strong> There are repayment programs for recent graduates with low incomes that would reduce your monthly payments.</p><p> <strong>  Family member: </strong> Oh yeah, I called, and I think they said that&rsquo;s what I have. I owe $450 per month. I think they deferred them, but they said I can pay them if I want to.</p><p> <strong>  Me: </strong> Send me the paperwork.</p><p> The U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s newest loan repayment plan is called  <u>  <a href=\"http://ticas.org/blog/new-income-driven-repayment-plan-now-available-all-federal-direct-student-loan-borrowers-repaye\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   REPAYE  </a> </u>  &ndash; the Revised Pay as You Earn Plan. It caps monthly payments at 10 percent of the borrower&rsquo;s after-tax, discretionary income and is for people who are &ldquo;having trouble affording your monthly payments.&rdquo; That description also fits the PAYE repayment plan.</p><p> The  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans#direct-and-ffel\" target=\"_blank\">   other options  </a> </u>  on the DOE website are the Standard Repayment Plan, the Graduated Repayment Plan, the Extended Repayment Plan, the Income-based Repayment Plan, the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan, and the Income-Sensitive Repayment Plan.</p><p> Lemoine said one of REPAYE&rsquo;s distinguishing features is that, in contrast to the more restricted repayment options made available in the past, REPAYE applies to virtually all federal student borrowers. Another good thing to know is that individuals can &ldquo;flip between&rdquo; the various repayment plans, depending on their circumstances, he said. There is also a repayment plan now for  <u>  <a href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/consolidation\" target=\"_blank\">   consolidated loans  </a> </u> , he said.</p><p> Lemoine understands the complexities of figuring out which plan is best for each individual.</p><h3> Yet he still asks this question: &ldquo;Is there some reason we can&rsquo;t have one repayment plan?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This blog plans to write more in coming months about weighing various student loan repayment options. Meanwhile, here are some resources:</p><li> ClearPoint Credit Counseling has an extensive  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/blog/how-to-pay-off-private-student-loans-from-sallie-mae-and-other-lenders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog post  </a> </u>  explaining the refinancing options for private student loans financed by Sallie Mae, banks and other financial institutions.

Keeping your business running smoothly in a transition means addressing the needs of your employees before, during and after the change. So let&rsquo;s start at the beginning and work forward.</p><h3> Before the Change Takes Place, Open a Dialogue</h3><p> <br/> People are creatures of habit and naturally resist changing their routines. Change creates stress, and status quo is comfortable. So setting up the change is important. Give yourself time to announce the change early enough that your employees get used to the idea. Create an open dialogue during which they have the opportunity to ask questions of you, discuss the transition with each other and make suggestions. Let them know that you&rsquo;ll be helping them each step of the way and that you&rsquo;ll make yourself available to them to address their concerns.</p><p> Your employees look to you for guidance when things get unfamiliar, and they&rsquo;ll follow your lead. If you&rsquo;re excited about the transition and looking forward to the end result, that excitement will be communicated. If you&rsquo;re hesitant or fearful of the change yourself, they&rsquo;ll pick up that vibe as well. They&rsquo;re your team! Be positive. Let them know that you value their expertise and skill and that you&rsquo;re in it together with them.</p><h3> Make it Safe</h3><p> <br/> According to an article from Inc.com,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/samuel-bacharach/four-reasons-your-employees-resist-change-and-how-to-overcome-them.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   4 Reasons Your Employees Resist Change  </a> </u> , the reasons why employees resist transitions have to do with feeling secure:</p><li> <strong>  The need to feel competent:  </strong> You feel the most secure in your position when you know the ropes inside and out and have your feet firmly planted in confidence that you can do your job well. When a person is thrust into another job or their job description changes dramatically; Now suddenly, they feel less confident, more unsure of their abilities&mdash;less safe. <br/>  </li><p> Think about this when changing your team&rsquo;s mission, culture, or work processes. Some thrive on new challenges, while others feel vulnerable. For them, change means learning new skills and giving up the things they&rsquo;ve become good at.</p><li> <strong>  The fear of failure: </strong>  We all fear failure. It makes some hesitate, and for others it can lead to complete immobility. Change easily draws out an individual&rsquo;s fears; fear that they&rsquo;ll mess up and look bad.But also, people fear what comes with failure: being laid off, not getting promoted, missing out on a bonus, etc.It&rsquo;s your job to understand this fear and be sympathetic to it. There will be mistakes during transition, so let your employees know that you understand this, and that you&rsquo;re willing to accept some stumbling along the way. It&rsquo;s up to you to create a safe learning environment and remind employees that this time period is for learning from mistakes&mdash;not being punished for them. Mastery will come with time and practice.</li><li> <strong>  The need for stability of status:  </strong> When positions are getting shifted around and reporting structures change, people often feel that their current social status in the company is threatened. Be sensitive to this, and maintain a supportive dialogue with individuals who will be most affected by the change. <br/>  </li><p> Understanding why your employees may resist change, where they&rsquo;re coming from in terms of their comfort level, job security and fear of failure can help you make the transitory environment less threatening.</p><h3> Keep the Customer Focus</h3><p> <br/> Even if you&rsquo;ve done your homework and have fully prepared your employees for a big shift, there&rsquo;s lots of competition out there. During times of upheaval or change, focus on the customer&rsquo;s needs can easily fall by the wayside if you&rsquo;re not careful. To make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen, coach your employees on why customers keep buying from you, and get their input on potential new paths to customer happiness.</p><p> Allow them thinking time to look at their customers&rsquo; needs through the lens of your transition and give them leeway to bridge gaps in service and come up with their own ideas to enhance experience. Just as your dialogue with them needs to stay open, you should also encourage them to collaborate with each other to find the best way to help customers as team. Employees with a customer focus will naturally be creative and intuitive if they feel safe during the change and you&rsquo;ve given them elbow room.</p><h3> Stay in the Trenches with Them</h3><p> <br/> The best leaders are those who demonstrate a willingness to roll up sleeves and work side-by-side with their team to accomplish goals. You&rsquo;ve demonstrated that you&rsquo;re aware of the problems they may have with transition. You&rsquo;ve opened a dialogue and have empowered them to think outside the box.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve made the transition environment safe for them and have them focused on the end goal of providing a fantastic customer experience. Now is not the time to just leave your employees to the job and walk away. Show them your support by working through the kinks with them. Help them navigate unexpected hurdles and emergencies. Keep the dialogue going and keep tweaking the system to work out the bottlenecks.</p><p> When I was President/CEO of a publishing business in 2005 we transitioned from an outsourced warehouse and distribution to handling in house. The change was brutal, we were incredibly behind with delivery, and it was &ldquo;all hands on deck.&rdquo; Imagine the look on everyone&rsquo;s face, and the boost in morale, when I worked morning until night packing, lifting and delivering hundreds of those 40 pound boxes.</p><p> During a transition, you&rsquo;ve got to wear a lot of different hats in your relationships with employees. Sometimes you&rsquo;re a cheerleader&mdash;sometimes you&rsquo;re a counselor&mdash;and sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to pick up that wrench and dive in with them to get something done. Your job as a leader is to get your employees ready and comfortable with the changes you&rsquo;re making. When you do, you&rsquo;ll see a huge return on those relationships in terms of loyalty and trust, which leads to high performance and job satisfaction.  <u>  #RonR </u> &hellip;  <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/so-what-is-noletup/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   #NoLetUp  </a> </u></p><p> This originally posted on <u>  <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ted Rubin  </a> </u></p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-02-29 19:09:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-02-29 19:09:23.000000","image_url":"2016/2/article_placeholder_yxEefmj.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/change-management-is-hard-here-are-4-ways-to-make-it-easier/\", \"post_id\": \"9535\", \"post_date\": \"2016-02-29 19:09:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-02-29 19:09:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"change-management-is-hard-here-are-4-ways-to-make-it-easier\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9534\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4569\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Change-Management-is-Hard-Here-Are-4-Ways-to-Make-it-Easier.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"604\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456828200,"author_id":471,"chart_url":""}

It was just the last straw.</h3><p> <br/> He never laid a finger on me - never even lifted a hand. And I knew that he would never hurt me.</p><p> Yes, adults in loving relationships (married or not) argue.</p><p> But these did not feel like arguments -- they were fierce and regular. They typically started as a silent treatment to show disapproval and were then followed by a spewing of vitriolic words that left me quaking and unsteady - oral hits to my character, my loyalty and my choices.</p><p> Although I would never consider myself much of a confrontational person, I threw the verbal blows right back at him in defense.</p><p> In the end, we would sit back down and talk rationally again until all settled out and our relationship world was whole again.</p><h3> Until the next time.</h3><p> <br/> That is not to say that the relationship wasn&rsquo;t good.

{"original_id":4403,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisor Roundtable: Communicating During Volatile Markets","link":"advisor-roundtable-communicating-during-volatile-markets","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Introduction: Following a month of stocks bouncing around the market&rsquo;s most recent bottom, SunStar Strategic clients participated in a Peer Roundtable to share their collective wisdom on how to best address investor concerns.</h3><p> <br/> This edited transcript of the conversation omits specific participant and firm names, thus references to &ldquo;we&rdquo; represent multiple speakers/firms. </p><p> When the market drops, investors get nervous and interact more with their financial advisors.</p><p> <strong>  Do you have a communication strategy? </strong></p><p> <strong>  What do you say to calm investors and advisors? </strong></p><p> <strong>  How can you  be a step above the competition? </strong></p><h3> Help is Needed</h3><p> <br/> Advisors want help and fund firms are stepping up. In a recent interview in Money Management Executive, Mark McKenna, Putnam&rsquo;s Head of Global Marketing, said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crucial moment to provide a driving manual for anyone selling your product....[D]istributors are large organizations, but ...[are saying],  &lsquo;Help us package this information and help us put it into an understandable fashion for advisors.&rsquo;&rdquo;  <br/>   <br/> There is definitely increased anxiety. We&rsquo;re getting calls from advisors that want a little color on the quarter and on what we think is going on in the market right now.  It&rsquo;s picked up considerably just in the month of January.</p><h3> Stick to Your Messages</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;re trying to do our best job to educate investors and keep our messaging consistent. We&rsquo;re emphasizing that fundamentals are what&rsquo;s important, even in a market right now where fundamentals are not reflected.</p><p> We know the businesses in our portfolios and feel comfortable with what we own, despite the fact that the market is not rewarding fundamentals.</p><p> We believe fundamentals will eventually matter.</p><h3> Address Emotions</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a lot of emotion that people experience at times like this. People just are so full of emotion. We generally manage balanced portfolios, so where appropriate, we say, &ldquo;Your overall portfolio is preservation oriented,&rdquo; but some people can only hang in so long. If you just try to go back and forth with them, they feel like they&rsquo;re trapped and have no options. At that point, we say, understandably, some people can&rsquo;t take this.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t recommend that you get out of the portfolio that we put you in, but if you&rsquo;re at the end of your rope, it can be done. <br/> <br/> That gives them ownership of the situation- often taking the level of emotion down so that they at least feel like, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m not being forced to stay here,&rdquo; and perhaps take the longer view.</p><h3> Seize Opportunities</h3><p> <br/> Many clients are concerned about the markets and the big picture. However, each manager typically is just one slice of the asset allocation of a large portfolio.</p><p> Once diversified, as they generally are, the messages that we stress, whether in difficult times or in good times, are that quality matters. The quality of your holdings is critical. Valuation matters dearly. What you pay for those assets is critical.</p><p> Moreover, we tell them that active management is the best way to get to those things.</p><p> As active managers, we can be a bit opportunistic and separate the fundamentals from the hysteria. It&rsquo;s just this sort of time that we&rsquo;re able to capitalize on that and try to assure clients that this is just a short-term thing. The businesses and their values, their intrinsic values today are just what they were yesterday.</p><p> The market is just giving us a little better opportunity to step into their stocks. </p><h3> Offer Historical Perspective</h3><p> <br/> We stress that in the market, there are ups and downs and, unfortunately, things don&rsquo;t just go in one direction.</p><p> Volatility is a part of the world we live in. We try to put it into a historical perspective. This has happened before, it will happen again.</p><p> We know our companies well and we just tell a story. We start talking about a specific business and why it&rsquo;s trading beneath its intrinsic value and how we&rsquo;re really focused on individual companies.</p><p> We talk about market timing and then the different statistics. We try to show historically why market timing is so challenging, getting in and getting out at exactly the right times is nearly impossible. <br/> <br/> In March 2000, the market felt good, and then the NASDAQ went down 70 percent plus from that point. Looking at March 2009, everything felt terrible, yet that would have been the best time to have invested.  Presenting that history helps people understand. We just have to hold investors hands through this volatile time.</p><h3> Be Proactive in Your Outreach</h3><p> <br/> We have been calling clients, advisory firms, or consultants and offering to do a conference call with one of the portfolio managers. Those have been really well received. </p><p> We are always evaluating our ideas for insightful thoughts that we can turn  <br/> into content.</p><p> One of our managers made a few internal comments about the types of stocks that shine toward the end of a bull market. He paired that with thoughts about the first thing that moves, historically, as we exit a bear market. That&rsquo;s the kind of thought process we can use to put together a communication to our clients, noting, &ldquo;This is the way we see things and we&rsquo;re looking for any sign that a change is imminent.\"</p><h3> Consider the Full Array of Communication Tools <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Emails: </strong> Some of the larger firms like Schwab do a good job of communicating with their shareholders, their advisors, through regular e-mail communications to let people know their perspectives. Another smaller firm that does a good job of communicating is U.S. Global. </li><li> <strong>  Webinars: </strong> Webinars are a great way to get in front of a number of your shareholders to tell them what&rsquo;s going on in your portfolio, your thoughts on the markets, and where you can add value. Financial advisors need to talk, they&rsquo;re getting the same calls that your firms are getting from them, but from their clients</li><li> <strong>  Podcasts:  </strong> James Investments does a daily segment on their local radio station, which they turn into a podcast and post to their website. Vanguard and JP Morgan did podcasts highlighting some of the risks today and talking about volatility.  </li><li> <strong>  White papers: </strong>  While some  studies show that there is a decreased demand for white papers, a well-written one can still be an excellent way to show the basis for your thinking.</li><li> <strong>  Videos: </strong>  Some video hosting websites also produce your video, such as Asset TV, which has become very popular.  If you can do it on your own, we suggest that you do so regularly and send them out to your advisors. </li><li> <strong>  Commentary: </strong>  Get as much content on your website as possible.  If you have thoughts and views on the markets, let people know what you&rsquo;re thinking and what&rsquo;s going on in your portfolios.  </li><li> <strong>  Blogs:  </strong> Blogs can be time consuming. To be effective, you have to contribute regularly or people won&rsquo;t be visiting your blogs.  Some companies found this to be an excellent tool to keep the advisors engaged.  </li><li> <strong>  Media:  </strong> Being in the media is an important tool. So is leveraging your media, your TV appearances, online quotes and other media mentions. As you try to alleviate some of the anxiety that people have about this market, a media presence keeps you in front of your investors and can provide another touch point via email. </li><li> <strong>  Social:  </strong> This can be a tough nut to crack for smaller firms. Nevertheless, follow some of the larger firms that are on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. They may not be creating new content for social media, rather, they typically repurpose content they have or send out some of their media appearances. <br/>  </li><h3> Dig Deeper</h3><p> <br/> It is important to lead with empathy and use a very personalized approach. During past volatile periods, we have sent out some canned messages. We have also tested different messaging and put together quick &ldquo;white papers.&rdquo; But, we found that advisors said they got that kind of communication from everybody &ndash;what they really were looking for were companies that empathized with and acknowledged the concerns they had. </p><p> This time, we are developing thought leadership, sending out market memos periodically as circumstances warrant.</p><p> Often, they are for internal use primarily, but serve as talking points for our sales staff.  They include market commentary updated regularly. We might pull from them to send mass emails to clients.  We try to look for the reasons behind the volatility and share that insight.  </p><p> We publish video Q&amp;As with our portfolio managers. Part of the video is free form, part typical quarterly commentary. In times like this, we emphasize not only our role as a stock picker, but also our role as a person to guide you in asset allocation.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve written almost every client a letter describing their asset allocation. While performance of late may be troubling to many, we stress that down markets are often followed by sharp rallies and you don&rsquo;t want to unnecessarily panic and get fully out of equities. </p><h3> Rely on an Infrastructure</h3><p> <br/> Many fund firms of the thousands out there don&rsquo;t have a communications infrastructure set and are hoping to get discovered through good performance. Many may not  have a way to develop content, to develop a story that resonates, or to get the story to the right people.</p><p> During difficult markets like this one, firms struggle if there is no process in place to create content. </p><p> One thing that I think that those of us who are fairly well prepared have in our favor is the ability to get something out there when we have something to say.  For example, with portfolio managers that are accessible, I think you can really stand out by taking advantage of that regularly, not just waiting for the quarter-end cycle when everyone expects a commentary.  </p><p> It&rsquo;s effective to publish content at unusual times, or maybe in a different format. That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ve been able to capture advisors&rsquo; attention.   <br/> <br/> The most heartening thing is when an advisor uses your piece and then comments, &ldquo;You really helped me write a letter to my clients, because I got that piece of content from you, repackaged it and used it with my clients.&rdquo;   <br/> <br/> We&rsquo;ve gotten some traction in those off-cycle, unusually timed commentaries or ideas.

We eventually landed on investigating some of the gaps around the customer, the insurer, and distributors.  I won't bore you with these now almost 10 year-old results, but they generally centered around better leveraging data, personalizing the experience, and leveraging digital as an enabler.  Customers were becoming more price sensitive and distributors overwhelmingly saw Internet as their biggest threat. <br/> <br/> We have certainly seen insurance evolve over the past decade, but the industry faces some of the same challenges as it did a decade ago.  However, that pace of change is accelerating.  Our  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.worldinsurancereport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   World Insurance Report 2016  </a> </u> , released today by  <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Capgemini  </u>    </a> and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.efma.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Efma  </a> </u> , takes a look at how the Internet of Things and increasing digital demand may be signaling major disruption on the horizon for the insurance industry. <br/> <br/> We surveyed over 15,500 insurance customers and interviewed over 180 senior insurance executives across 30 countries.  Our analysis found three overarching trends: <br/> <br/> <strong>  1. Gen Y customer behavior is foretelling the future for insurers. </strong>   With twice as many interactions and heavy digital channel usage, Gen Y has the lowest positive experience levels. <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. The inevitable advance of Connected Technologies/Internet of Things (IoT) will impact how insurers connect with customers and drive transformation. </strong>  Affluent customers show the highest propensity to adopt Connected Technologies. <br/> <br/> <strong>  3. Connected Technologies/IoT will require insurers to change how they fundamentally assess and manage risk. </strong> Risk is decreasing, increasingly transparent, and more likely to be shared. <br/> <br/> You can explore more findings and download the full  <a href=\"https://www.worldinsurancereport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   report  </u> </a> .

{"original_id":4405,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Client Attraction: Is It Part of Your Everyday Activity?","link":"client-attraction-is-it-part-of-your-everyday-activity","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Clients do not arrive at anyone&rsquo;s door without us attracting them. They don&rsquo;t.</h3><p> <br/> So what do you think attracts clients to work with you and is it an intentional part of your everyday activity? [The operative word being &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; in the question.] If you hesitated to answer, then check this out.</p><p> First, let&rsquo;s define the subtle differences in Push Marketing vs. Pull Marketing:</p><li> <strong>  Push Marketing is a strategy intended to sell you something outright. </strong> You set-up a direct-selling environment to be face-to-face in sales with a client.</li><li> <strong>  Pull Marketing is a strategy which involves motivating a client to seek you out of the crowd. </strong> You get the client to come to you. <br/>  </li><p> Both push and pull marketing strategies are an important part of a marketing plan for any business. Push marketing, however, seems to be more natural for many of us in financial services to do and today, I&rsquo;m will share three ways you can be  more intentional in implementing push marketing tactics for client attraction:</p><h3> Giving Away Value</h3><p> <br/> Free. Zilch. Zip. You simply give value away. Sounds crazy, right? I know some of you are thinking, &ldquo;Sheryl, giving away my craft doesn&rsquo;t pay my bills.&rdquo; Think about it this way though. You&rsquo;re at the cash register paying for your groceries and your favorite baseball team has a pocket takeaway for you to have a list of all their games right in your wallet. You grab it and go.</p><p> &hellip;that was pull marketing through giving away value.</p><p> What can you give away which would attract people to your business? Could you:</p><li> <strong>  &hellip;give a class at the local library on debt reduction? </strong></li><li> <strong>  &hellip;become a JA teacher for a local school and teach kids about finances? </strong></li><li> <strong>  &hellip;write a weekly column for your local paper about money? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Be intentional about what you plan to give away and make it something of real value to someone. Don&rsquo;t go into this thinking you&rsquo;re going to only give half of something away and make them work for the other half, it doesn&rsquo;t work like this and you&rsquo;ll be perceived as a jerk. Give away value and you will attract clients to your practice. If you give value away every day, people will have even more reason to do business with you.</p><h3> Social Media Amplification</h3><p> <br/> You know I have to get social media in this!  <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/70-marketers-will-spend-more-social-media-ads-year-162291\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Salesforce reported 70 percent of brands </a>  are increasing their social media spending in 2015. (I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s more for 2016!) Today, it&rsquo;s easier to connect with our clients via social media and make better purchasing decisions.</p><p> Any pull strategy requires a highly visible brand and social media helps amplify it. Your clients expect you to entertain and inform them. As mentioned above about giving away value, this is no longer considered &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s an expectation. Clients also expect to find this value through social media.</p><p> Using the local library class as an example, you could:</p><li> <strong>  &hellip;invite clients to attend the class and bring someone else would benefit from the material by posting this on Facebook and Twitter. </strong></li><li> <strong>  &hellip;with your class outline create a small graphic with some key points by using a cool tool called Pablo </strong> (found at  <a href=\"http://www.buffer.com/pablo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.buffer.com/pablo </a> ) and talk about the material with your followers.</li><li> <strong>  &hellip;connect on LinkedIn to the program director at the library and ask them to share your invite with their communit </strong> y. <br/>  </li><p> Have social media do the legwork for you. It has the ability to amplify far past what you can do by one-by-one. Social media is one-to-many.Leveraging social media is a smart marketing strategy with any push or pull marketing plans and it should be a part of your everyday activity.</p><h3> Word of Mouth Referrals</h3><p> <br/> This is the holy grail of pull marketing and some of the most effective ways to grow your business. Too often we wait until after the sale to ask for the referral. Instead, when the relationship is full steam ahead and clients are happy, why not ask during the process? You must have a specific process in place too. It might be filling out a form or sending them a question in a survey.</p><p> Going back to the giveaway, what if you gave your current client a 30-minute consultation to give to a friend who would benefit from similar services? My trainer, Chris Meier, recently gave me five business cards with one free workout to give to friends. It took me less than 2 hours to give those away. Doing something unexpected goes a long way with clients referring you!</p><p> How are you handling birthdays and thank you notes? I tried for one year to send out handwritten notes &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I have more than 3,000 connections and it was not feasible. However, I had time to send a thoughtful email or order a Starbucks gift card with a note and send it out. I had a much higher return on those than the handwritten note, which I still send out about 400 per year. When advisors have been referred to me, many have come with the set-up that I&rsquo;m thoughtful and incredibly thankful for business, which I truly am. I&rsquo;m intentional in making time for this every single day too.</p><p> <strong>  So what are you willing to do TODAY to attract clients to your business? What new habit are you going to begin working on TODAY to invite new people to learn about your practice? Client attraction must be an intentional part of your day-to-day duties. </strong></p><p> Write back and share with me. Any questions, I would love those too!</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-01 17:37:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-01 17:37:32.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_mtHflTU.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/client-attraction-is-it-part-of-your-everyday-activity/\", \"post_id\": \"9542\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-01 17:37:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-01 17:37:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"client-attraction-is-it-part-of-your-everyday-activity\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9540\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4573\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IoT-and-Increasing-Digital-Demand-Signals-Major-Insurance-Industry-Disruption.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"686\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456981200,"author_id":441,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4407,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Great Client Relationships ... Really?","link":"great-client-relationships-really","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The desire to improve is the first prerequisite for building better, deeper, and broader relationships with your clients.</h3><p> <br/> If you don&rsquo;t think there is a gap waiting to be filled, why would you go through the pain and cost of changing how you act? The problem is that many successful professionals are complacent about the quality and strength of their client relationships.</p><h3> There are two reasons for this.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First, </strong> in good relationships, people often overstate their role and attribute too much to their own actions. If you&rsquo;re a partner in a large professional firm, and you take over a relationship that your firm has had with client for over 20 years, how much credit do you personally deserve for retaining the client for another year or two?</p><p> <strong>  Second, </strong> people can easily overstate how good their client relationships really are. For example, here are some potential &ldquo;false positives&rdquo; that may not necessarily indicate a great relationship:</p><li> <strong>  Your client is highly responsive and always answers your phone calls </strong></li><li> <strong>  You are good friends with your client </strong></li><li> <strong>  The client has given you more business this year </strong></li><li> <strong>  The client does business with you year after year </strong> <br/>  </li><p> While these are potentially good signs, I can think of cases where these factors were present but the relationship was actually pretty mediocre. The responsive client, for example, may simply be very polite and have idle time on their hands; and just because you retain a client&rsquo;s business from year to year doesn&rsquo;t mean you have a built a trusted advisor relationship with them and are part of their inner circle.</p><p> Only by understanding the signposts of a great relationship, and honestly judging how your client relationship stack ups against each one, can you develop that all-important desire to improve.</p><h3> At an individual level, here are six critical signposts you should look out for in your client relationships: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Trust: </strong> How strong is the client&rsquo;s trust in your professional competence, your integrity, and your willingness to always focus on your client&rsquo;s agenda? Can you work informally, without constant checks, controls, and updates? Does your client require extensive documentation and analysis to support everything you say, or are they willing to consider your judgment and insight without challenging it?</li><li> <strong>  Thought leadership: </strong> Are you perceived as a trusted business advisor who brings both subject matter depth and broad business knowledge and judgment to the table? Are you shaping and leading the client&rsquo;s agenda, or simply reacting to it? Would your client say that you bring them new ideas on a regular basis? Do you have strong &ldquo;share of mind&rdquo; in terms of the group of individuals who are shaping how your client thinks?</li><li> <strong>  Inner circle: </strong> Do you have a &ldquo;seat at the table&rdquo; for significant strategic and operational conversations and decisions? Does your client call you and say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just thinking about this idea and I wanted to bounce it off you at an early stage&hellip;&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Transparency: </strong> Does the client openly share information with you about their plans, programs, priorities, and upcoming initiatives? Or are you kept in the dark, at arms-length? The willingness to be transparent is a manifestation of trust.</li><li> <strong>  Loyalty: </strong> Will the client always use you and the firm in areas of acknowledged competence?

{"original_id":4409,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Exit Planning Begins with Step One: Set Goals","link":"exit-planning-begins-with-step-one-set-goals","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In prior posts we have mentioned The Seven Step Exit Planning Process&trade;&mdash;the proven, owner-centric process that business owners use to plan successful exits from their companies.</p><p> The process benefits both owners and their companies even if they never plan to exit, but it begins and ends with an owner&rsquo;s principal exit objectives: 1) the date the owner wants to leave, 2) the amount of money owners want in the bank when they leave and 3) the successor they chose to take over their companies.</p><p> Once owners set these three objectives with your help and that of the other members of their Exit Planning teams, they can proceed through the next six steps of the process: determining and, if necessary, building and protecting business value, managing and coordinating business continuity and estate planning issues and finally, executing the transfer so that it meets the owner&rsquo;s financial and other goals.</p><p> <strong>  For some owners, a thumbnail sketch of a plan to achieve their goals is adequate. </strong> They know they should be planning for the most significant financial event of their business careers, and they like the fact that this Exit Planning Process is all about them. With these owners you can immediately dive into the planning process. Other owners however, need more of an explanation. They want to know exactly how the process works or, perhaps, why they can&rsquo;t skip some of the steps.</p><p> To answer that question, or at least to explain why they can&rsquo;t skip Step One, there are three pieces of information that must be accurately quantified before anyone can create a coherent or comprehensive Exit Plan: 1) a target departure date, 2) a preliminary financial needs analysis, and 3) a chosen successor.</p><p> The reason many owners never begin Exit Planning is that they have not spent any time considering the terms and conditions under which they would happily leave their businesses. Nor will they begin unless and until you initiate a discussion with them about those &ldquo;terms and conditions&rdquo; (their exit goals). Your discussion involves asking owners a lot of &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions designed to clarify their thinking and uncover goals they may not be aware of. In order to do that well, you need a solid understanding of exit goals, so let&rsquo;s begin with the goal most owners have floating around in their minds.</p><h3> Target Departure Date</h3><p> <br/> Setting a target departure date is indispensable to creating an Exit Plan. For example, a plan for an owner who wants out in two years looks quite different from a plan for that same owner with a departure date ten years later. BEI&rsquo;s survey of owners indicates that almost all owners have an exit date in mind: half want to exit within 5 years and 80 percent within 10 years.</p><h3> Types of Departure Dates</h3><p> <br/> Interestingly, while owners set their departure dates first, it is the one objective that owners most often adjust, and adjust repeatedly. This ongoing tinkering is so prevalent that Exit Planner&rsquo;s refer to it as the &ldquo;perpetual five-year Exit Plan.&rdquo; Owners want to exit in five years, but since they never start the exit process, they are always five years away from leaving. These owners typically pick a date&mdash;&ldquo;five years from now&rdquo; out of the air. Since the date has no particular meaning for them, it is easy to ignore. You can determine if a departure date holds meaning for an owner by asking a number of questions such as, &ldquo;Why do you want to exit in five years? What do you see yourself doing in five years?&rdquo;</p><p> Many owners pick an event-related departure date. For example, do they want to work until their children reach a certain age or level of education? Other owners want to remain until the business value reaches a certain level, or until the business can operate without them.</p><p> Still other owners base their exit date on more personal reasons. For example they may calculate the number of active years they want to live without working to arrive at a departure date.</p><h3> Departure Dates Prompt Action</h3><p> <br/> When owners set a departure date based on their personal aspirations, they are more likely to take action. These owners are pulled into action because they want to exit on a specific date for specific reasons.</p><p> The message is clear: If you let an owner off the departure date hook, you have handed that owner a license to procrastinate. When that happens, owners take no action, you have done them no favors, and you do not have an Exit Planning client. Owners must set, even tentatively, a departure date to give their Exit Plan a stable framework. Until that date is set, you cannot begin to create a successful Exit Plan.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-01 18:26:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-01 18:26:21.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_lEb7rcA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/exit-planning-begins-with-step-one-set-goals/\", \"post_id\": \"9549\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-01 18:26:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-01 18:26:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"exit-planning-begins-with-step-one-set-goals\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9548\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4578\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Exit-Planning-Begins-with-Step-One-Set-Goals.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"941\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456915500,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4410,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Advisors: 4 Tips to Make Your Blog More Socially Shareable","link":"advisors-4-tips-to-make-your-blog-more-socially-shareable","source_link":null,"content":"<p> 88% of millennials used Facebook as their main source of news in 2015. <strong>  As a financial advisor, you should be continuously trying to reach a wider audience in order to help build brand awareness and thought leadership. </strong> Content marketing helps boost your websites SEO, increasing the overall traffic to your website and ups your position as a thought leader in the financial industry.</p><p> Blogs are a great way to attract future clients and keep current clients up-to-date. Here are four tips to help make your blog more socially shareable.</p><h3> Cut the Jargon</h3><p> <br/> As a financial advisor, you&rsquo;re well-versed in your trade. When it comes to making your blog more socially shareable, however, you&rsquo;ll want to keep specialized financial vocabulary to a minimum. Always keep in mind that your audience, for the most part, is not comprised of other financial advisors who have a background in Financial Planning and are familiar with terms like &ldquo;annuity,&rdquo; &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; and &ldquo;asset class diversification&rdquo;.</p><p> To make your blog more socially shareable, write simply and clearly. Avoid using jargon, but if you have to, make sure that you explain it in a simple and direct way. Always take your audience demographic into consideration.</p><h3> Be Mindful of Your Audience</h3><p> <br/> Cutting the jargon does not, however, mean dumbing down your language. Instead, write informative and direct posts about a variety of subjects. You can write about general topics like retirement, or much more specific ones like what you need to know about your RRSP as this year&rsquo;s deadline approaches. Make sure that they are well-researched and well-written, as clients and prospects will continue to visit your blog if they feel that they are receiving unique, valuable and sound financial advice.</p><h3> Get Connected</h3><p> <br/> A great way to attract more visitors to your blog is to advertise it on social media. Get connected through the use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. These platforms will allow you to promote your blog regularly in creative and interesting ways. The key word here is regularly. In order to maintain public interest in your blog, you will need to post frequently. People will lose interest very quickly in your blog if you&rsquo;re only posting once every few months. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to post three times a day (in fact, that&rsquo;s probably overdoing it), but rather that you should come up with a reasonable schedule and stick to it. Websites that are updated with fresh content regularly generally receive significantly higher traffic than those that are not.</p><h3> Keep Your Word Count to a Minimum</h3><p> <br/> This is a crucial tip. When you&rsquo;re writing blog posts, don&rsquo;t churn out a Moby Dick length novel of financial advice. Keep your posts short and to-the-point so readers aren&rsquo;t overwhelmed or bored. It is important to keep in mind that the majority of website visitors scan a new page, rather than read it word for word.  By keeping your blog posts short and concise, or in list form, it will make it easier to engage visitors who prefer to scan a page.</p><p> Just as you keep your posts to a reasonable length, make sure that you stick to the point. As a financial advisor, people are visiting your blog to read valuable advice and gain unique insight into financial activities so be sure to fulfill that component.</p><p> Social media is a great way to build your personal brand. Making your blog sharable across several platforms will help you keep your current clients informed while expanding your reach to new prospects. An increase in traffic for your website, over time will position you as a thought leader in the financial planning industry.

{"original_id":4411,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Data Should Be a Two-Way Conversation, Not Just a Marketing Tool","link":"data-should-be-a-two-way-conversation-not-just-a-marketing-tool","source_link":null,"content":"<p> From <u>  <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/fitbit/surge/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tracking devices  </a> </u> that inspire people to get up and move to <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/01/microsoft-hands-on/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   goggles  </a> </u> that add a digital overlay to the material world, electronics are becoming inseparable from our everyday lives.</p><p> The data revolution is in full swing, and companies now have access to an unprecedented amount of information about our activity. But for this technology to truly enhance our lives, the data revolution must coincide with a user experience revolution.</p><p> Our electronics no longer separate us from the physical world but can actually contribute to and reshape our experience of it. However, many companies lack the imagination to take advantage of this opportunity. They glean data only to optimize marketing and operations, and in doing so, they miss out on the chance to play an integral role in improving users&rsquo; lives and strengthening their relationships with consumers.</p><h3> Data Should Be a Two-Way Street</h3><p> <br/> Data should be a two-way conversation, not a mining operation. Consider fitness trackers like the <u>  Jawbone UP </u> . They not only monitor how you sleep, where you go, and how many steps it takes to get there but actually use this information to alter your behavior, suggesting ways to sleep better or exercise more. These trackers are not just digital logbooks, though. By turning data into an interaction with users, Jawbone and Fitbit act as catalysts for change. This is why these tech companies are associated with healthy living &mdash; not just zeros and ones.</p><p> Other companies could use their data for this same kind of mutually beneficial relationship. Visa, for example, has a ridiculous amount of purchasing information: what people buy, where they go, what they like. The company uses this data for marketing purposes, but it could be doing so much more. This data could generate a menu of new experiences for the user: new food choices, new nightlife options, and new vacations. But Visa is just sitting on this potential because it doesn&rsquo;t think of data as a two-way street or ask if anything more is possible.</p><h3> Data Tracking Should Be Intuitive</h3><p> <br/> More intuitive ways to gather data are springing up all the time, but many businesses fail to take advantage of them. Look at the healthcare industry as an example. The intake process is still a series of antiquated form-based interfaces on iPads that get passed from one sick person to the next.</p><p> Much of the information on these forms is already recorded on the electronic health record, and Google probably knows most patients&rsquo; symptoms before they even enter a doctor&rsquo;s office because patients look them up before making an appointment.</p><p> Eventually we should reach a point where checking in is the beginning and the end of the data-entry process for the patient and the healthcare provider. Hospitals could even create an experience where a small microphone picks up a patient&rsquo;s name and connects that greeting to a voiceprint, providing all of the necessary data for each appointment. We have the potential to streamline an inherently stressful process, but only if the healthcare industry is willing to question what&rsquo;s possible and turn the data it collects into a conversation with each patient.</p><h3> Data Interfaces Should Be Intimate</h3><p> <br/> Data isn&rsquo;t just numbers. It shows the intimate minutia of our day. Fitness trackers record our sleep and exercise habits. Web searches represent our hopes and fears. The GPS on our phones show where we go, whom we&rsquo;re with, and how we spend our time. Tracking this data represents a personal involvement in users&rsquo; lives, so the user interfaces should feel intimate and human.</p><p> Experiences are already beginning to elbow their way off of our screens and into our lives. Amazon&rsquo;s Echo is a great example of a well-designed user interface. Instead of relying on a screen, Echo communicates through a voice interface. Her ability to respond is incredible, and the voice quality is remarkable. The physical object is barely noticeable because the user can simply talk. That&rsquo;s the future of reimagined interface design.</p><h3> The User Experience Revolution Begins with Imagination</h3><p> <br/> To build a two-way, intimate, and intuitive data conversation, businesses need to enter the design process with the user experience in mind. Everyone from the CEO to the design team should be trying things firsthand &mdash; wearing wearables, spending too much time in virtual reality, and 3D-printing tools instead of buying them.</p><p> Turning these personal experiences into breakthrough innovations is just a matter of imagining what&rsquo;s possible and tying it to what&rsquo;s practical.

{"original_id":4412,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Requalifying Will Make You a More Successful Closer","link":"requalifying-will-make-you-a-more-successful-closer","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As I&rsquo;ve suggested before, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to requalify your prospect at the start of your demo or presentation.</h3><p> <br/> Doing so allows you to anticipate objections and position your presentation to speak to whatever resistance you may face later on.</p><p> When I make this suggestion, I get a lot of pushback from sales reps. &ldquo;But if I ask for the deal before I&rsquo;ve given the presentation, before I&rsquo;ve given the value, they&rsquo;ll just say no!&rdquo; is the most common objection I get.</p><p> So let me make it clear: You&rsquo;re not &ldquo;asking for the deal&rdquo; at the beginning, instead you&rsquo;re using a trial close to access the next steps and to get a feel for the kind of pushback you might get at the end of your demo. Getting this information is crucial for you to leverage the rest of the call.</p><h3> There are several ways to use a trial close.</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s the aggressive way below that is appropriate if you&rsquo;ve been aggressive on the first call and identified the decision maker and time-frame. <strong>  If you have, then something like this will work: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, as we talked about last week, I&rsquo;m going to go through everything now, answer any questions you have, and if, at the end of the demo today, you feel this will definitely help you drive more business, then is this something you can put to work for you today?&rdquo;</p><p> Some sales reps (O.K., most sales reps) will be uncomfortable with this kind of requalifying because they haven&rsquo;t done a thorough job up front. If that&rsquo;s the case, then here is a softer trial close:</p><p> &ldquo;_________, I&rsquo;m looking forward to covering everything with you today. Just out of curiosity, if at the end you feel this is just what you are looking for, what would be the next steps to putting it to work for you?&rdquo;</p><p> This is a soft, non-threatening way of finding out what his/her answer is going to be at the end when you ask for the sale. All of you have to agree you&rsquo;d like to know that, right?</p><p> <strong>  Another, in-between way, of requalifying at the beginning is: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;__________, at the end of today&rsquo;s demo if you like what you see, is there anything that would prevent you from putting this to work for you in the next two weeks?&rdquo;</p><p> The positive way of asking this is:</p><p> &ldquo;__________, at the end of today&rsquo;s demo if you like what you see, is this something you could put to work for you in the next two weeks?&rdquo;</p><p> O.K., so there are the ways of using a trial close at the beginning. Now, what happens if you get push back? <strong>  Here&rsquo;s how to handle it. If you&rsquo;re prospect says: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready to make a decision&rdquo; (or any variation of that), you simply respond:</p><p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no problem and I&rsquo;m not asking you to. We haven&rsquo;t gone through the benefits here nor have I answered any of your questions. All I&rsquo;m trying to get a feel for is IF you like what you see and you think there is value here for you and your company, what would you have to do to get this approved?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you and don&rsquo;t mistake my question for pressure. All I&rsquo;m asking is IF, after the end of our demo today, you see value here and want to pursue this, what are the next steps on your end?&rdquo;</p><p> What you&rsquo;re trying to do is isolate and uncover what the objection or stall is going to be at the end so you can position yourself to deal with it and advance the sale. For example, if your prospect then says something like:</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take it to the committee,&rdquo; (or show it to the boss, etc.), <strong>  then you isolate this now: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand and most people I speak with do as well. Tell me, if you really like this, though, what kind of influence do you have over that process?&rdquo;</p><p> AND:</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you. And if you are in favor of this, would that affect their decision?&rdquo;</p><p> Again, you want to isolate the objection and understand the stall so you can deal with the close at the end better. <strong>  For example, if your prospect tells you they DO have influence, then at the end of your demo, this is how you close: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;So, does this sound like something you feel is the right fit?&rdquo;</p><p> [Get buy in here, then]:</p><p> &ldquo;Great, then what can I do to help them agree with us?&rdquo;</p><p> See how this goes?</p><p> If the objection or stall at the beginning of your demo is the &ldquo;No budget&rdquo; stall, <strong>  then say: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m not asking you to invest in this right now, and we can deal with where you&rsquo;d get the budget from later. All I want to know now is that IF you found value here and were determined to move forward, is there a way you could find the resources &ndash; again, if you were convinced?&rdquo;</p><p> If the answer is no, then you need to deal with the money issue now rather than spend the next 45 minutes on a demo that will end with the same objection!</p><p> I know this isn&rsquo;t going to be a popular answer for many of you &ndash; again, I know you&rsquo;d rather pitch until you&rsquo;re blue in the face &ndash; but if your prospect can&rsquo;t afford to do it at the end, why would you want to?</p><p> What I&rsquo;m suggesting here is what I&rsquo;ve taught for many years, and what I personally do when closing on my training services: properly qualify prospects upfront &ndash; on the cold call or prospecting call &ndash; on the six qualifiers, <strong>  and then requalify before you waste the time of giving a long pitch to someone who isn&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t buy at the end. </strong></p><p> Doing this will make you a more successful closer &ndash; and a more confident one as well.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-01 18:43:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-01 18:43:47.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_vl15yMJ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/requalifying-will-make-you-a-more-successful-closer/\", \"post_id\": \"9555\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-01 18:43:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-01 18:43:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"requalifying-will-make-you-a-more-successful-closer\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9554\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4581\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Requalifying-Will-Make-You-a-More-Successful-Closer.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"523\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456925400,"author_id":348,"chart_url":""}

Have some companies lost touch with real consumer points of interest and excitement that they blurred the line between industry talk and consumer talk? If so maybe this is one of our many ailments in banking.It&rsquo;s innovation for you, dear company, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; or &ldquo;better&rdquo; for the consumer. Yes innovation is good, innovation is grand but that&rsquo;s an internal conversation, you do so for yourself, so that you remain relevant to your consumer, it isn&rsquo;t a gift for the customer.What matters to the consumer is that you give them &ldquo;good&rdquo;, &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and &ldquo;useful&rdquo; products, services and features (well in banking those would translate to &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;, &ldquo;not mind-numbingly boring&rdquo; and &ldquo;usable&rdquo;) not whether they are innovative. <img alt=\"lowstandards\" src=\"https://cdnstatic.duenablomstrom.com/dblomstromcontent/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/lowstandards.png \"/> Maybe this is why some banks are content building and maintaining an Innovation Lab instead of delivering anything out of it to the end customer because they believe &ldquo;innovation is for them&rdquo;.To consumers innovation translates to progress and progress is expected. No one expects technology to do anything other than deliver better, faster and bigger experience returns ever so often. From electronics to cars to apps, we&rsquo;re a generation of consumers with a high threshold for amazement and incredibly lofty expectations of progress and improvement in everything in interact with and purchase in shorter and shorter time spans. We didn&rsquo;t even know that a tablet would exist a few years ago, but we now instinctively expect the next version to be lighter, smarter, brighter and generally better in every way and we expect the next version to reach us within months of the first one. Or else.We&rsquo;re fickle and impatient as consumers, now. Innovation is not for us, it&rsquo;s for you company selling us something to stay in the game and satisfy our impatience and penchant for awe.Granted, as I said many times, in banking the sense of urgency and necessity is dramatically lower as consumers keep giving digital and physical services from banks a hall pass they give no other type of retailer.When I ordered a cold drink at Starbucks and they handed me a hot one &ndash; do you know what happened? They apologised profusely for the mix up that cost me five minutes&rsquo; delay and handed me a card explaining they would do anything for my love including giving me a free beverage next time I&rsquo;m back. I was stunned and pleasantly surprised and resolved to remain loyal. (The first time only, the next time that it happened, I expected it.)When I tried to close my business account with HSBC and jumped through 1000 loops that cost me hours and they assured me it was done only to send me a statement the next month as if none of that had transpired &ndash; do you know what happened? A lady on the phone told me in monotone &ldquo;computer says NO&rdquo; tones that there was likely a mix up and I would have to come in and do it all over again.

But like an orchestra, a meeting is only as good as the &ldquo;conductor.&rdquo; A poorly conducted meeting can just as easily demoralize, de-motivate and create disrespect and resentment among attendees.</p><p> Are people inspired and motivated by your meetings? Do they hear 100 percent of your message and then communicate it effectively to the rest of the organization?</p><p> Here are some time-proven strategies to make your meetings more effective:</p><li> <strong>  Distribute an agenda. </strong> Provide a meeting agenda two or three days in advance. Some attendees won&rsquo;t bother to review it ahead of time. Not reviewing the agenda may be their way of telling you they consider your meetings a waste of time. Make the attendee accountable.</li><li> <strong>  Send support documents. </strong>  Include this information in advance with the agenda. These documents may be reports or updates. Provide instructions on what recipients should do with the information before the meeting, especially when preparation is necessary or additional information is required. Most people do not like being put on the spot when the documents are reviewed during the meeting.</li><li> <strong>  Meet in the morning. </strong>  Afternoon meetings require presenters to fight attendee&rsquo;s &ldquo;food coma&rdquo; in addition to other distractions such as a preoccupation with what&rsquo;s on their desks and stress anticipating the additional work you&rsquo;re about to give them.</li><li> <strong>  Nothing new. </strong>  Do not distribute new reports at meetings. Stick to what&rsquo;s on the agenda.</li><li> <strong>  Hold Meetings That Matter&trade;:  </strong></li><li> <strong>  Start on time; end on time. </strong> Starting late can become habit forming. Ending late will provoke resentment forming.</li><li> <strong>  Cut the length.  </strong> Trim two-hour meetings to 75 minutes, one-hour meetings to 45 minutes, and 30-minute meetings to 20 minutes. You&rsquo;ll accomplish as much and attendees will appreciate getting back more of their work day.</li><li> <strong>  Cellphones off. </strong>  At this point in our electronic advancement, do we really need to ask people to turn off their devices?</li><li> <strong>  Do not jump right into the agenda.  </strong> People typically need a few minutes to get extraneous thoughts off their minds, clear space, and get on the same page. A five-minute general conversation, check-in, or just asking attendees to greet each other usually suffices. You could even ask people to bullet-point on paper what&rsquo;s currently on their minds. Doing so is proven to help the brain absorb new information, making it easier to replace the thoughts that were just written down.</li><li> <strong>  Review and present. </strong>  Review the agenda aloud and state a specific outcome for the meeting. If you can&rsquo;t articulate a purpose for the meeting, don&rsquo;t have it.</li><li> <strong>  Note action items. </strong>  As the meeting concludes, assign tasks and responsibilities. There should be no more than three action items per meeting. Each must include a &ldquo;Who&rdquo; and a &ldquo;When&rdquo; plus any &ldquo;milestones&rdquo; for follow-up.</li><li> <strong>  Recap.  </strong> Restate what&rsquo;s been discussed and agreed to, including the &ldquo;Who&rdquo; and &ldquo;When&rdquo; of any action items.</li><li> <strong>  Get out the calendar. </strong>  Before dismissing attendees, schedule your next meeting.</li><li> <strong>  Follow-up. </strong>  It&rsquo;s important to check in immediately with individuals responsible for actions items. The best way to follow up is in-person; second best is by phone. Email is not an effective follow-up.</li>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-01 22:14:17.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-01 22:14:17.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_bjTWmjP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/time-proven-strategies-to-make-your-meetings-more-effective/\", \"post_id\": \"9563\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-01 22:14:17\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-01 22:14:17\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"time-proven-strategies-to-make-your-meetings-more-effective\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9562\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4585\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Time-proven-strategies-to-make-your-meetings-more-effective.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"510\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456938000,"author_id":458,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4417,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Five Simple Steps to Help Reduce Stress at Work","link":"five-simple-steps-to-help-reduce-stress-at-work","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In the past two decades, increasing numbers of reports, surveys and studies confirm what most of us already knew: For the majority of American employees, work equals stress.</p><li> 80% of employees are stressed at work due to at least one factor;</li><li> Almost half of them confess that they don&rsquo;t know how to manage occupational stress and need guidance;</li><li> 25% cite their job as the number-one stressor in their lives;</li><li> Work-related stress causes employees to entertain violent thoughts &ndash;</li><li> A quarter of stressed-out workers have felt like lashing out because of their stress; and</li><li> More than half of that number felt like striking a co-worker.</li><p> We all have felt some pressure at work at one point or another in our professional lives, as any job will contain areas that can cause employees to become stressed out. Even though these factors can vary depending on the individual and his or her particular occupation, the hits often keep on coming at most jobs. The daily demands, lack of control, long hours and heavy workloads, work-to-personal-life imbalance, uncertainty about their employment future, lack of support, intimidating bosses, and inexperienced or uncooperative co-workers, as well as employees&rsquo; own reactions to these things, mean that stress continues from day to day.</p><p> While some of us can manage work-related pressure well and don&rsquo;t let it affect our personal lives, for others coping is not so easy. Many loathe coming to their workplace every morning because they already know that they will not have a good day there. When days like this start to pile up, workers are at risk of becoming chronically stressed, which in turn can cause numerous health problems, in particular hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. When you say &ldquo;My job is making me sick,&rdquo; you might just be right!</p><p> Furthermore, occupational stress doesn&rsquo;t affect only the person subjected to it; it also impacts our relationships with co-workers and various other people in our lives.</p><p> How does an article on empathy help with managing stress? Empathy is all about understanding others; it&rsquo;s a skill that allows us to relate to other people and their problems by being able to imagine what they are going through as if those experiences were our own. When it comes to stress, learning empathic skills toward co-workers or even those in charge can help to reduce a stressful response.</p><p> Unfortunately, the skill of empathy and the vagaries of the workplace don&rsquo;t often coincide. Maybe when we talk about understanding and accommodating the needs of our customers or clients, empathy does matter, but it rarely is mentioned in the context of work relationships with colleagues, and virtually never when issues involve bosses and supervisors. Some experts argue that the problem with business today is misattributed to a dearth of innovation, whereas it should be ascribed to a lack of empathy.</p><p> Quality of work relationships does matter, and there is now a good bit of scientific evidence to prove that being empathetic at work can not only create a more collaborative environment and foster good relationships with co-workers, but also reduce the amount of work-related stress. A recent  <u>  European study </u>  of nearly 3,000 managers found that more than 60% of them feel stressed at work. The researchers from BI Norwegian Business School discovered that managers who had good relationships with their employees, who in turn understood the managers&rsquo; challenges and participated in solving those problems, experienced significantly less stress.</p><p> While it is true that there are many obstacles to achieving a stress-free work environment, our relationships with co-workers constitute one obstacle we can influence. We don&rsquo;t get to choose the people we work with &ndash; a modern workplace is a hodge-podge of cultures, personalities and experiences &ndash; but we can choose to openly communicate with our colleagues and treat them with compassion, dignity and respect.</p><h3> Supportive, empathetic relationships may not come naturally, and it does take exercising an &ldquo;empathy muscle&rdquo; to get good at this.</h3><p> <br/> So here are some ways in which we can build cordial relationships with colleagues and bosses and, in turn, reduce stress at work.</p><li> <strong>  Practice reframing. </strong> Stress stems from our own reactions to situations and people, and we are the ones who react and frame the situation. Reframing can help us see things in a different light or from the perspective of another person. Oftentimes we react to problems a certain way because of our feelings and subjective interpretations of others&rsquo; motives and intentions. But not everyone is the same, so a desire to get things done can be misconstrued as being overly aggressive and pushy. A person who needs to think things through can be perceived as disengaged and unwilling to act. Reframing means noticing the judgmental words we apply and making them more objective in response.</li><li> <strong>  Identify and effectively manage negative thoughts and feelings. </strong>  Our thoughts and subsequent behaviors influence the people we interact with much in the same manner as their actions affect us. Negative self-talk not only worsens our own state of mind, it can also adversely affect our communication with other people. It&rsquo;s important to identify the triggers that set off our negative self-talk, and make a conscious choice to stop it and turn it to more positive language. Any negativity will diminish our capacity for empathy and will heighten our stress responses.</li><li> <strong>  Practice being grateful.  </strong> When work gets stressful, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to focus on how bad things are and disregard everything good that we still have or get to experience. Things don&rsquo;t always work out smoothly, so it is beneficial to remind ourselves once in a while about what we are grateful for. If the job is stressful but your co-workers are wonderful and supportive people &ndash; show your gratitude and appreciation to them; if the people you work with are causing you stress but you still love your job &ndash; be grateful for it; if your job is nothing like your dream job but it helps you take care of your family, than it is also something to be grateful for.</li><li> <strong>  Avoid negative people. </strong> As much as you don&rsquo;t want to be a source of negativity for your co-workers, you don&rsquo;t want others&rsquo; stress and discontent to affect you. Co-workers who always complain about their jobs and bosses, judge and gossip about others, or do not care about doing their work well are not the sort of crowd you should stick with. Colleagues who struggle with their workload, for example, deserve your empathy and will likely appreciate the help offered, but there are also people who thrive on making others feel miserable, and no amount of empathy can change them, so the wise decision would be to avoid such people altogether.</li><li> <strong>  Communicate. </strong> Honest and open communication is key to creating and maintaining empathetic relationships with co-workers. Instead of keeping your doubts, concerns and frustrations to yourself, choose to discuss them with your colleagues. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to avoid misunderstandings and related stress. Communication brings people closer together, and allows them to get to know one another better and therefore understand each other&rsquo;s position, motivations and behaviors, and way of thinking. Communication may not be as glamorous as some other strategies for relationship-building, but it does help bolster empathy, and therefore allows for more effective teamwork and greater employee productivity. <br/>  </li><p> Stress at work is hardly avoidable, but we are not helpless in the face of it. Honing our ability to treat others with empathy is one of the most effective ways to diminish work-related stress. When we make an effort to really understand others, they usually react positively in response and try to understand us as well. Let&rsquo;s remember that we are capable of being empathetic, and it&rsquo;s a simple yet effective way to foster healthier work relationships and prevent undue stress.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-01 22:32:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-01 22:32:29.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_vfNPlO4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/five-simple-steps-to-help-reduce-stress-at-work/\", \"post_id\": \"9565\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-01 22:32:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-01 22:32:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"five-simple-steps-to-help-reduce-stress-at-work\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9564\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4586\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Five-simple-steps-to-help-reduce-stress-at-work.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"694\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1456948800,"author_id":59,"chart_url":""}

It depends who you ask, but the general consensus seems to be those of us born between 1980-1995. Following the footsteps of Boomers (1946-1964) and Gen X (1965-1980), hordes of Millennials (also called Gen Y) are now joining the workforce.It&rsquo;s estimated that by 2020, roughly half of the US workforce will be Millennials. Lee Caraher, the San Francisco-based author of the book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Millennials-Management-Essential-Guide-Making/dp/1629560278\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Millennials &amp; Management  </a> </u>  comments, &ldquo;A business without Millennials is a business without a future.&rdquo;Interestingly, when it comes to sales specifically, the qualities of a Millennial make us a great fit for the career. Sales gives us the opportunity to interact with a variety of people, the flexibility to create our own work/life balance, and of course, merit-based rewards.As sales as a profession continues to shed its negative, greasy car-salesman perception, it is starting to catch the attention of more and more Millennials. So what are we looking for? Ping pong tables, open-concept offices and beer fridges may seem like the easiest way to lure us in; however, a look at the data suggests there is a little more to it. These are the 4 things you need to consider and manage to attract and retain top Millennial team members.</p><h3> We Like Transparency</h3>If you&rsquo;re transparent, we&rsquo;re transparent. A <u> <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/millennialworkplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  study commissioned by IBM </a></u> in 2015 found, when asked what makes a &ldquo;perfect boss,&rdquo; Millennials said they want a manager &ldquo;who&rsquo;s ethical and fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;values transparency.&rdquo; Interestingly, this response beat out other positive qualities such as &ldquo;recognizes their accomplishments&rdquo; and &ldquo;values their input.&rdquo;<u> <a href=\"https://buffer.com/transparency\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Buffer </a></u>, a social network service, turned a lot of heads by announcing their &ldquo;Transparency Dashboard,&rdquo; a web page that showcases their salaries, equity formula and even financial statements. Similarly, more and more companies are beginning to display their base salary and commission structures upfront. With this transparency, Millennials feel informed and valued by  their employers, traits that foster both top performance and loyalty.<h3> We Want To Keep Learning</h3>We&rsquo;re on course to become the most educated generation in North American history. According to the most recent census, among 18 to 24 year olds, <u> <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98\" target=\"_blank\">  a record number, 41%, were enrolled in college as of 2012 </a></u>. Our Boomer parents have encouraged Millennials to value and appreciate continued education. We want to know that we will have the opportunity for personal development. By offering comprehensive training to new hires, you'll draw top, young, talent to your company.We also want to have the opportunity to continue learning in the workplace. IBM found 39% of us would opt to attend a third-party sponsored conference, 37% would attend classroom training and 36% would like to work with a mentor to learn on the job. The traditional &ldquo;boss&rdquo; or &ldquo;manager&rdquo; role is changing as well. A <u> recent study</u> by Intelligence Group found 79% of Millennials want their boss to serve more as a coach or mentor.<h3> We&rsquo;re Online, We&rsquo;re Mobile, And We&rsquo;re Using Marketplaces</h3>So we&rsquo;re looking for jobs, but where are we hiding? It&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll find us browsing the Classifieds for an open role, in fact, some of us might not even know what what means.We&rsquo;re Online.As Millennials, we were raised in a tech-savvy world. We&rsquo;re the first digital natives to join the workforce, a major differentiator between us and older colleagues. We <u> adopt and evaluate new technologies and methodologies twice as quickly</u> as the general population. We&rsquo;re also more than willing to <u> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-the-office-millennials-are-the-boss-when-it-comes-to-technology-1435020052\" target=\"_blank\">  teach these new tips to our co-workers </a></u> (just ask!) and peers.A recent report from <u> <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/11/19/searching-for-work-in-the-digital-era/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Pew Research </a></u> shocked old-school employers and recruiters, finding that 94% of smartphone job seekers (representing 26% of all American adults) have used their smartphone to browse or research job listings.Finally, we are beginning to see the uprise of job matching marketplaces such as <u> <a href=\"https://angel.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AngelList </a></u> for startups, <u> <a href=\"https://www.wirkn.com/en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Wirkn </a></u> for hourly workers and Ideal Candidate for salespeople. <u> <a href=\"http://ideal.jobs/1URbtwI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ideal Candidate </a></u>, specifically for salespeople, challenges the &ldquo;gut feel hiring&rdquo; that has traditionally plagued the sales recruitment industry and match candidates based on data. Millennials are attracted to the concept of matching not just to a role, but to a company&rsquo;s overall corporate culture.<h3> We Want To Make A Difference (And Commission)</h3><u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/01/13/what-millennials-want-in-the-workplace-and-why-you-should-start-giving-it-to-them/\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennial research from the Intelligence Group </a></u> found a record-breaking 64% of Millennials say it&rsquo;s a priority for them to make the world a better place. Accordingly, we are also the first generation to believe that <u> business can affect greater change than government</u>.The <u> <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-Deloitte/gx-dttl-2014-millennial-survey-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  four issues most often cited </a></u> as important to Millennials are reducing unemployment, reversing resource scarcity, protecting the environment, and addressing inequality of incomes and wealth.When choosing an employer, <u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robasghar/2014/01/29/study-millennials-work-ethic-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/\" target=\"_blank\">  95% of Millennials say that a company&rsquo;s reputation matters to them </a></u>. By emphasizing the opportunity to disrupt, improve and build industries that we care about, you will capture the attention of passionate salespeople.<h3> The Takeaway</h3>Millennials. You may have heard of us in the same breath as &ldquo;attention-hungry&rdquo;, &ldquo;self-centered&rdquo; and &ldquo;lazy.&rdquo; Are we really 15 years worth of entitled brats?

{"original_id":4419,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Successful People Never Blame Others","link":"why-successful-people-never-blame-others","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> As a young adult looking for the perfect job, I wanted to blame others for why my life wasn&rsquo;t spectacularly successful. <br/>  </h3><p> It was always someone else&rsquo;s fault&mdash;not recognizing my potential, not giving me a chance, not giving me a second (or third) chance.</p><p> I became an FBI agent at the age of 25 but I still balked at taking full responsibility for my actions, whined when things didn&rsquo;t go my way and pointed fingers at someone else when things went south.</p><p> This attitude was challenged the first day of my training at the FBI Academy. I was there to learn lessons. And once I learned a lesson I moved on the next one. The pieces shifted into place when I realized that if I failed to learn a lesson, I needed to keep finding opportunities to learn it again and again until it stuck.</p><p> For entrepreneurs and business owners, it means having the mental toughness you need to get through the failures and hard times, without giving up or blaming others for your situation.</p><h3> Here are 5 reasons why successful people never blame others: <br/>  </h3><h3> REASON #1: When You Don&rsquo;t Blame Others You Become Resilient <br/>  </h3><p> The FBI Academy and my first couple of years as a field agent quickly knocked these negative traits out of my system because to be successful, agents need to be resilient.</p><p> To be resilient is to recognize that if you are dissatisfied with certain aspects of your life, then it is your responsibility to take the initiative and do something about it.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Take responsibility for your actions&mdash;stop whining, blaming others, and pointing fingers if you don&rsquo;t get what you want. </strong></p><h3> REASON #2: When You Don&rsquo;t Blame Others You Become More Confident <br/>  </h3><p> Lack of confidence in ourselves and our abilities is a major reason we blame others when something goes wrong.</p><p> Instead of being open or curious about learning more, a part of us shuts down. Sometimes we blame ourselves as much as blaming others. Focusing on why we failed at something does nothing more than chip away at our confidence; instead, dig down and uncover what we can learn from the experience.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Consciously and deliberately move into an exploratory frame of mind that is more curious about learning than shameful of making mistakes. </strong></p><h3> REASON #3: When You Don&rsquo;t Blame Others You Stop Making Excuses For Yourself <br/>  </h3><p> Blaming others for our own actions is nothing more than making excuses for ourselves. In the process, we will have learned nothing from what has transpired and so the lesson inevitably will have to be learned again&hellip;and on it goes.</p><p> Stop blaming others for what you have or don&rsquo;t have, or for what you feel or don&rsquo;t feel.  When you blame others for what you&rsquo;re going through, you deny responsibility and perpetuate the problem. Blaming is just another sorry excuse, and making excuses is the first step towards failure; you and only you are responsible for your life choices and decisions.</p><p> <strong>  When we blame others, we give away our power. </strong></p><p> Often, our thinking is caught up in blame and dealing with the pain of our thoughts and what it all means rather than simply and quickly doing what we need to do.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Start to question your thoughts and probe deeper into why you default to &ldquo;blaming others.&rdquo; Ask yourself, &ldquo;Is this really true?&rdquo; Often you will find the basis of those thought are just plain silly! The key is to question your thinking because once you do, you often discover that what you think you believe really isn&rsquo;t true at all. </strong></p><h3> REASON #4: When You Don&rsquo;t Blame Others You Allow Space For Personal Growth <br/>  </h3><p> Too many of us spend so much of our time on going through the motions of living&mdash;getting married, buying homes, climbing the corporate ladder&mdash;that we don&rsquo;t focus on personal growth. We do not allocate enough time just for ourselves.</p><p> Instead of concentrating on what others did wrong, focus on what you want to go right in your life. And then do it.</p><p> <strong>  Grit up. Be. Fiercely. Awesome! </strong></p><p> If you don&rsquo;t, you will wake up some day and realize that you are no closer to being the person you want to be than you were years ago. You will find that you&rsquo;ve aged, but never grown into your potential.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: Realize that the next step in living a life full of value and meaning for you will not reveal itself in the future&mdash;it is to be taken now.  </strong></p><h3> REASON #5: When You Blame Others You Become The Victor, Not the Victim <br/>  </h3><p> When you feel the victim, you gain power over the situation by blaming other people for your situation.</p><p> Loss of control over one&rsquo;s life is always associated with feelings of helplessness. There is a very clear link between mental toughness and the way we approach our helplessness.</p><p> If we believe a situation is permanent, we&rsquo;ll remain helpless&mdash;we think about our lack of talent, ability, etc&mdash;and believe nothing we can do will change it.</p><p> But if we believe the cause is temporary, we can act to change it. We feel more in control if we believe we have a possible solution at hand.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: With each problem you face, you can learn a new skill or new fact. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-02 17:22:53.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-02 17:22:53.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_vf329yH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-successful-people-never-blame-others/\", \"post_id\": \"9569\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-02 17:22:53\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-02 17:22:53\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-successful-people-never-blame-others\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9568\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4588\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Why-Successful-People-Never-Blame-Others.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1025\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457001900,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}

I enjoy shirking the system and I LOVE shortcuts. As a behavior hacker I am constantly searching for accelerated methods of learning, performing and achieving. Now I want to teach you.<strong> You can hack your way to success.</strong>Many of you have asked me about our marketing strategies and growth path. It&rsquo;s been a long windy road to say the least, but I decided to use the amazing book <u> <a href=\"http://www.shanesnow.com/smartcuts#review-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Smartcuts </a></u> by Shane Snow as a jumping off point. I chose Smartcuts for <u> <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/science-of-people-book-club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Science of People book club </a></u> because I believe the most successful people and businesses forge their own paths.I have synthesized Snow&rsquo;s mental nuggets and combined them with case studies from the Science of People over the last 8 years. I hope it inspires you on your business adventure!<h3> <strong>  10 Ways to Hack Your Success: </strong></h3><h3> #1: Hack the Ladder</h3>Imagine that I gave you a paperclip and asked you to use it to get me a kayak. How would you do it? This is the premise of a game called Bigger or Better. In Bigger or Better, students at Brigham Young University are given something of little value&ndash;a paperclip, a rubber band, a toothpick. They are then encouraged to walk up to strangers&rsquo; doors and ask if they would like to trade for something bigger or better. They continue to do this until they do in fact have pretty big and pretty better things. It might go like this:<li> Toothpick traded for a pack of gum. (She bought a whole box at Costco)</li><li> Pack of gum traded for a a crossword puzzle book. (He bought it for his wife, she already owned that copy)</li><li> Crossword puzzle book traded for a flashlight. (He loves crosswords! Flashlight is by the door, he doesn&rsquo;t need it anyways)</li><li> Flashlight traded for a potted rose plant. (The pot was a gift, it doesn&rsquo;t match the rest on her patio)</li><li> Potted rose plant traded for a glue gun. (His wife will love the rose! Take her glue gun so she stops crafting)</li><li> Glue gun traded for a transportable cooler. (Glue gun, cool! We&rsquo;re too old to camp, take our cooler)</li><li> Transportable cooler traded for a razor scooter. (I have been dying to get rid of this scooter since the grandkids grew up)</li><li> Razor scooter traded for a kayak. (Son will love this razor scooter and we need to make space in the garage for his new car)</li><li> Conclusion: Paperclip &ndash;&gt; Kayak</li>Every career, every club and every organization has some kind of ladder. This is a hierarchy, path or system you are supposed to take to the top. But do you really have to? We very rarely stop and think about how we can skip rungs on our ladder. Heck, sometimes we forget that we are even on a ladder. No more! I want you to come up with a smartcut for at least one rung:What ladder are you on? Identify at least 5 steps in front of you:For example, yours might be 1. Win big new client  2. Get raise  3. Get project management certification 4. Get manager title  5. Get raise.Now I want you to think of ways you can smartcut. These are not obvious ones. Typically, smartcuts for the ladder fall into these categories:<li> Learning a new skill</li><li> Meeting the right group of people</li><li> Switching departments</li><li> Getting a certification (rather than a degree)</li><li> Tackling a different kind of project</li><li> Taking an alternate route</li>What are 3 ways you can smartcut?For example, yours might be 1. Do on-the-ground project management with new client 2. Change departments for manager title 3. Learn programming.<h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>I think I may have broke the ladder on my way up. I run a psychology blog, but I don&rsquo;t have a psychology degree. I do research, but I don&rsquo;t work at a university. I teach, but I don&rsquo;t work at schools. But I think the &lsquo;Hack the Ladder&rsquo; I want to break down for you is the typical blog ladder. Here&rsquo;s the ladder of &ldquo;How to Be a Successful Blogger&rdquo; usually goes:<li> Have idea</li><li> Buy domain</li><li> Start writing articles</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Add pictures</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Get on social media</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Write more articles</li><li> Start a newsletter</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Try to start earning revenue with ads</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Try to start earning revenue with ebooks</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Try to start earning revenue with consulting</li><li> Beg people to read</li><li> Try to start earning revenue with affiliate dollars</li><li> Realize you aren&rsquo;t making any money still</li><li> Realize not enough people are reading</li><li> Be sad.</li>I was on this ladder for a LONG time. I had a few blogs before Science of People and they were all exactly the same path. I always ended up sad and without a lot of revenue. Finally, with Science of People I decided to hack the ladder. First, I realized begging people to read didn&rsquo;t work. I also realized that unless you have thousands of followers (back then I did not) then social media doesn&rsquo;t work great. So I stopped putting energy into that. I realized that the best way to hack my blog to popularity would be to borrow other people&rsquo;s popularity. So instead of begging my friends and family to read on social media, I started to reach out to specific psychologists, authors, behavioral economists and writers who I knew geeked out on people science. I figured it was way better to have one fellow geek reading my article than a hundred semi-interested people. My ladder looked more like this:<li> Have idea to translate people science into real life tips</li><li> Buy domain ScienceofPeople.com</li><li> Write an article</li><li> Email the authors of each study cited in the article</li><li> Email a psychologist who writes about this topic</li><li> Email a columnist who has written about the topic in the past</li><li> Post on Quora to people interested in this topic</li><li> Comment on articles relevant to this topic</li><li> Write an article</li><li> Email the authors of each study cited in the article</li><li> Email a psychologist who writes about this topic</li><li> Email a columnist who has written about the topic in the past</li><li> Post on Quora to people interested in this topic</li><li> Comment on articles relevant to this topic</li><li> Repeat.</li>Article by article, those very targeted people became friends. They also occasionally posted to their audiences and friends. They sent me cool new research. I found my people. It seems slow, but actually this process is much faster than the normal ladder. So again, what ladder are you on? How can you hack it? How can you break it?<h3> #2: Training with Masters</h3>Does mentorship work? Snow argues that mentorship is not a clear story. &ldquo;Data indicates that those who trained with successful people who&rsquo;ve &lsquo;been there&rsquo; tend to achieve success faster&hellip; except there&rsquo;s one small wrinkle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not quite true,&rdquo; says Snow. Mentorship alone is not the key to success, nor is it an effective smartcut. The key to effective mentorship is not what you would expect. It&rsquo;s:VulnerabilityMost people think of mentors bringing value through their connections and contacts. While this is true, it&rsquo;s not the whole story. The right mentors share what went wrong, not just what went right. You have to search for mentors that are willing to share their weaknesses, their failures and let you deep dive with them on why they happened. Many, many lovely people email me asking if I will mentor them. I knew that the only successful mentorship is one of complete trust and openness, so the only people I mentor are my Science of People trainers. Why? We have regular office hours where I can talk to them with complete honesty (and confidentiality) about both my failings and my successes so they can learn from both. Whether you are a mentor or want a mentor make sure that you are asking for the bad along with the good. Remember, we can&rsquo;t have light without dark.<h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>Remember when I told you about breaking the ladder? That change did not happen on accident. About 3 years up the traditional blogging ladder, I sat down with a very prominent blogger for coffee. I had begged, pleaded and traded my left elbow to get this meeting, and I was practically foaming at the mouth to meet him. I had a smooth list of 10 questions (11 if time permitted) and couldn&rsquo;t wait for him to unlock all the keys to success. About 10 minutes in he sighed and said something that rocked me to my core. &ldquo;You know, I am going to be honest with you. I don&rsquo;t make money from my blog.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. He had hundreds of thousands of followers and was quoted everywhere around the Internet. He went on: &ldquo;Traffic does not equal revenue.&rdquo; UGH! There is the magical assumption that if you have a lot of traffic and a lot of followers you will somehow make money. He went on to explain that not all traffic is created equal and, most importantly, blog traffic is not a business plan. This completely changed the goals of my online business. His honesty saved me years of debt.<h3> #3: Rapid Feedback</h3>When you think you have the world&rsquo;s next greatest idea, you want to make it perfect. This is a tendency we all have. We have an invention, but we don&rsquo;t want to tell anyone until we have a perfectly working prototype. We are writing a book and don&rsquo;t want anyone to see a single word until it is edited to within an inch of its life. This is the slowest and most expensive way to fail. I say slowest, because it will take you months of research and development to find out no one wants to buy your product. I say expensive because it will take 5 prototypes, 6 drafts and $10,000 before you realize it won&rsquo;t sell.The best concept for rapid feedback, which we use at the Science of People is a concept called Minimum Viable Product showcased by the super talented author and speaker <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup </u> .</a>Minimum Viable Product (MVP): A version of your product or service which allows you to collect the maximum amount of learning about customers with the least amount of effort.You want the sweet spot of testing:Rather than spending months developing, perfecting and researching, instead launch small and launch often. The key here is to meticulously track success or the data with each mini-launch. What do customers say? How many clicks do you get? Is it easier or harder to get testimonials? You want to have as many launches and tweaks as you can possibly get. Like this:Exercise: If you had to make the most basic version of your product or service what would it be?Eric Ries jokes that if you aren&rsquo;t embarrassed by your first launch then you waited to long to put it out there.<h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>I have dabbled in almost every source of revenue generation out there&ndash;books, webinars, speaking, coaching, courses, ebooks, consulting, sponsorship, advertising, spokesperson deals, drug dealing, banana peeling, popsicle licking&hellip; you get the idea. (Not really the last 3). Anyways, I learned that sometimes things worked and sometimes they didn&rsquo;t. Using the Lean Startup model I began testing ideas faster. One completely changed my business:Online courses.When online courses were just starting to pick up momentum in 2012, my husband insisted I try turning one of my live seminars into online curriculum. I had two options:<li> Option #1: Hire a studio, videographer and editor. Write teleprompter scripts in coordination with slides and book a 3-day film shoot.</li><li> Option #2: Film it on my iPhone in my kitchen using the lights in my apartment.</li>As a disciple of the MVP principle, I decided to keep it simple. I went with Option #2. My first course was rough&ndash;the content is great, but man the lighting is awful and I am speaking into a $30 microphone from Amazon. I wrote it, filmed it and launched it within about 3 weeks (based on years of speaking live, but still you get the idea). I hoped to sell 30 courses. I decided if I could sell 100 I would try to go with Option #1 for the next course. 42,000 students later, we have a full studio built into our house.<li> Here is the important part: If I had gone with Option #1, I would have missed out. I was the very first body language course on Udemy so I had a corner on the market. I was also able to learn A TON from the MVP and film a killer course once we decided to go with Option #1.</li>Bottom Line: We made more money, had faster growth and made better courses because we started with an MVP.<h3> #4: Platforms</h3>Do you use the principle of leverage in your life? Do you take existing tools, technologies or methods and leverage them to work for you? The principle of platforms is learning how to NOT build things from scratch. It is building your world on top of what already works. This concept is quite old. It is summed up nicely in the cliche:Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.But you know, a lot of people reinvent crappy, unsymmetrical, ugly wheels. When they are asked, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just use a normal wheel?&rdquo; They say, &ldquo;Oh, but I wanted to do it myself. I wanted to build it from scratch. That&rsquo;s what a real entrepreneur is.&rdquo; No, that&rsquo;s not a real entrepreneur. That&rsquo;s a silly entrepreneur. Let me give you an example I hear every single week in my business circles:Silly Entrepreneur: &ldquo;Ugh, I am having so many website problems!&rdquo;Me: &ldquo;Oh no! Thats awful!&rdquo;Silly Entrepreneur: &ldquo;I know, it keeps crashing and I am losing so many sales.&rdquo;Me: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? I thought you used WordPress.&rdquo;Silly Entrepreneur: &ldquo;Oh I do use WordPress, but we built a custom theme.&rdquo;Me: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;Silly Entrepreneur: &ldquo;I wanted a really special website. It was only $10,000 to build it, but I have to pay a retainer of $500 a month if I want them to keep working on it.&rdquo;Me: &ldquo;Let me guess, it breaks every time WordPress has an update.&rdquo;Silly Entrepreneur: &ldquo;Exactly! Ugh so frustrating. I&rsquo;m starting my business and this is the last thing I need!&rdquo;WordPress offers free or under $100 themes on its platform. They work great. You are looking at one right now. Why oh why oh why in the beginning of your business would you spend the money to build a custom theme? Sure, if you are rolling in the dough and want a full time tech person on staff&ndash; build all the custom themes you want. But why spend time, energy and money on this when you don&rsquo;t have to. WordPress has a platform that&rsquo;s awesome. Use it and build on top of it.Platforms don&rsquo;t just come in the shape of technology, sometimes they come on knowledge from a previous career, a network, relationships or a skill that you have. My questions for you are:<li> What platform can you leverage?</li><li> Are there tools that already exist that you can build on?</li><li> How can you stop reinventing the wheel?</li><h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>I am not a tech person. I do not know how to program. When you say Ruby, I think emerald. When you say Reddit, I say &ldquo;Did you mean rabbit?&rdquo; However, my business requires me to have some basic understanding of technology. Using platforms, I have been able to build my business much faster. This is the hard part: People constantly tempt you into trying to build your own system instead of using existing platforms. All of these were battles I have fought in my business:<li> Vanessa, you should build a custom website = We use a WordPress template</li><li> Vanessa, you should build a membership site = We use a WordPress plugin called  <u>  <a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/c/extensibility/plugin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Discourse  </a> </u> . It&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://discuss.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   awesome  </a> </u> .</li><li> Vanessa, you should build your own app = We just have an RSS feed</li><li> Vanessa, you should build your own email capture follow-up = We use InfusionSoft</li>The big one was something called our Learning Management System (LMS). So many online instructors try to build their own system for hosting courses or they use a janky multi-leveled system with WooCommerce and Paypal. Why? Building your own takes forever and is a lot of money and using a cheap system will look cheap (unless you are in MVP mode). I love finding platforms and building on them, I hope you will too.<h3> #5: Waves</h3>What makes a good surfer? Her ability to ride the waves? His athletic prowess? Nope. The best surfers know how to read the ocean. Instead of riding small, unimpressive waves and wasting energy, they wait for the perfect one. The one that will blow everyone out of the water. This concept is about two things:<li> Reading the world around you and leveraging the perfect moment</li><li> Saving your energy for the perfect moment</li>Throwing spaghetti at the wall does not work in business. Small companies don&rsquo;t have the time or energy to boil enough pasta, let alone clean up the mess. So, you have to not only find the right noodle, but also throw it at the right wall to know it will stick. This is the hard part. Our inclination is to deep dive into all the work that needs to be done for our business. But all too often, we forget to sit back, look around and notice our competitive environment. Here&rsquo;s how you get good at reading the waves in your business and I will explain each of them using the Science of People Case Study.<li> Keep pulse on the world trends.</li><li> Read your industry like the ocean.</li><li> Just because you can, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should.</li><h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3><li> Keep pulse on the world trends. I read a number of select newsletters and bulletins to keep track of trends. I know that being an early mover on a trend can get you a ton of momentum (see Step #7). For example, Twitter launched in 2006. I joined in October 2007. No one was on  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vvanedwards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u>  at the time except early adopters. But because I made a profile so early, I easily racked up followers from newcomers over the next 8 years. Same with  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/vvanedwards\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Periscope  </a> </u> . I joined a few months ago and don&rsquo;t do many videos, but I get followers all the time. Why? As my Facebook friends discover it, I am automatically suggested to them. I have no idea if Periscope will survive, but if it does, I plan to ride the wave and will do more videos.</li><li> Read your industry like the ocean. My business is self-help. That&rsquo;s simplified, but it&rsquo;s the best category fit. I write books, I write blogs, I give advice, I teach, I coach, I consult. In 2005, YouTube came onto the scene. Within a year, it was quickly becoming one of the fastest growing websites. I joined in 2007. I knew that self-help was going to move in the video direction, I just wasn&rsquo;t sure how. But again, in the early days if you put up a video, it was much more likely to be watched because there was less competition. I was able to rank high for really, really stupid videos I made simply because they were the only ones in that category on those search terms.</li><li> Just because you can, doesn&rsquo;t mean you should. The first two bullets are about riding the trends, this last one is about picking the right one in the first place. Starting in the 2000&rsquo;s, the word podcasting kept getting thrown around. People were starting to listen to podcasts as a form of information, and I could see it was going to rock my self-help industry. If I had a unicorn for every time someone says to me, &ldquo;you should start a podcast&rdquo; I would have a truckload of unicorns! And believe me, I have thought about it. In the end, I decided to ride the podcasting wave. But not in the way you think. Instead of starting a podcast, I decided to try to help podcasts. I realized that every podcast was going to need guests and it would be much better for me to be readily available and have fun topics for podcasts than trying to start one of my own. And that&rsquo;s what I did&ndash;and do. I do almost 1 podcast a week and constantly am saving funny tidbits and stories for them. I could have started a podcast, but I am glad I didn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t the right noodle or the right wall for me.</li><h3> #6: Superconnectors</h3>We have heard about superconnectors from the amazing <u> Seth Godin in Linchpin</u>. We have learned about influencers in <u> The Tipping Point by the incredible Malcolm Gladwell</u>. Snow brings up a different take on superconnectors. He argues they can be very well-connected individuals, but they can also be tools or devices. He uses the fascinating example of the radio as a superconnector when it broadcasted Che Guevara&rsquo;s revolutionary messages in Cuba. A superconnector is something or someone that can amplify and expand your message. I want you to take a few moments and think of the superconnectors in your life:<li> Who do you know that seems to know all the right people?</li><li> What tool could radically improve your business?</li><li> How could you amplify your message?</li><h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>When I read the chapter on superconnectors,I instantly knew that our superconnector radically changed our business. We actually have two:<li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/user/vanessavanedwards/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Udemy:  </a> </u>  I mentioned filming the MVP of my first course, but I didn&rsquo;t mention how I sold it. Instead of selling it on my website&ndash;where we only had a few thousand readers, I decided to use a superconnector. Udemy is a learning marketplace. Think of it like an Amazon for online courses. Anyone can upload a course and Udemy helps you sell it to the right students. They were my amplifier. They took my course and broadcasted it, advertised it and marketed it to millions of their students. I am so incredibly grateful to Udemy for launching our tiny platform to their large platform.</li><li> <a href=\"https://www.creativelive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Creative Live </a> : Creative Live is similar to Udemy except that they produce and film all of their courses exclusively. You have to be invited to be an instructor on Creative Live and their courses are filmed on movie-quality sets with producers, camera men and real sound technicians. Their business is truly inspiring because they broadcast all of their courses for free. It was started by the super talented, superconnector,  <a href=\"http://www.chasejarvis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Chase  </u>  Jarvis </a>  who wanted to provide high quality creative education to all. I was lucky enough to film 2 courses on their platform the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/power-body-language/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Power of Body Language  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/people-skills/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Master Your People Skills  </a> </u>  and they broadcasted my courses to thousands of their students. The students I have met through Creative Live have truly changed my life, and I can&rsquo;t imagine my business without Chase and this superconnecting platform.</li><h3> #7: Momentum</h3><a href=\"https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"665\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-02-at-9.33.50-AM-2.png\" width=\"953\"/></a>click to viewHave you seen this video of &ldquo;Bear&rdquo; Vasquez exclaiming about a double rainbow? It has 42 million views as of writing this so you probably have. Despite the virality of this video, Snow brings it up as an example of what NOT to do. Why? Success typically comes in bursts. If you had to chart the success of most businesses, it would not be a straight upward curve. It would most likely look something like this:It hopefully goes up, but it probably has tons of little peaks and valleys. The best businesses take small successes and roll them into big ones. In other words, they capitalize on momentum. Bear Vasquez had one viral video&ndash;just one. He has tried to post others, but none had quite the same magic.<strong> Winners don&rsquo;t just celebrate success, they accelerate it.</strong>How closely do you look at your analytics? How often do you download your Twitter data? If you are just starting out, hopefully the answer is daily or at the least weekly. Why? You need to know what&rsquo;s working and capitalize on it. Every month, my team and I sit down and comb through the Twitter data. Which tweets worked? Which ones flopped? Which ones got the highest click rate versus the highest profile click rate. Then we tweak. We optimize. We build momentum with the movement that is already there. Here&rsquo;s what I encourage you to do:<li> Have a momentum tracker in place. You need to schedule time and space to monitor your momentum. Whether that is weekly analytics checking or daily blog checking, you want to capitalize on the things that are working. If you work with clients, are there methods or activities they love? Do more and then ask for a testimonial after that session. If you work in an office, when do you have good days? Do big write-ups or reviews then. I don&rsquo;t want you to just notice successes, I want you to get in the habit of amplifying them.</li><h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>Last year, we did a <u> <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/ted/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  huge experiment on TED talks </a></u>&mdash; we examined the body language patterns of the most viral and least viral videos on TED. Overview of the fun results here:<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wkfYzs2Qv-M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"\" height=\"638\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-02-at-9.36.14-AM-2.png\" width=\"1200\"/></a>click to viewWhen I first started talking about the experiment, people got really excited. Like, really excited. They wanted to know when the results would be out. People emailed me to follow-up asking if we had published the answers yet. I got excited, and we worked faster. But I realized that there was some organic momentum already building. Maybe we could give this study more legs if we gave it more pushes. So before launching, we decided to hire a PR firm. Instead of just putting up a blog, we filmed a snazzy video (above). Instead of just sending out a white paper, we made a nice report. And then we launched it instead of releasing it. The result? It got picked up and featured all over the place! The <u> <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/hub/ct-bc-learning-from-ted-talks-bsi-hub-20150929-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Chicago Tribune did a story </a> ,</u>so did <u> <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/vicky-castro/five-secrets-to-being-an-engaging-speaker.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  INC </a></u> and it even got featured on the actual <u> <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/body-language-survey-points-to-5-nonverbal-features-that-make-ted-talks-take-off/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  TED blog </a></u>! Watch for organic momentum so you can build on it.<h3> #8: Simplicity</h3>I&rsquo;m going to keep this one simple. Keep it simple. Don&rsquo;t give too many choices. Don&rsquo;t offer crazy plans. Don&rsquo;t make a multi-leveled business plan. If you can&rsquo;t explain it to a 5 year-old then it&rsquo;s too complicated.<h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>I&rsquo;m really bad at this one. I love having lots of choices and strategic plans and multi-part courses. But this doesn&rsquo;t work. The simplest example I can give of simplicity is when we redid our website. I used to have 10 tabs, 4 landing pages, eons and eons of sidebar stuff (I actually had 2 sidebars). It was clunky, cluttered and no one knew what to do when they got to our website. I knew this because our bounce rate was through the roof and our time on site was low. People were overwhelmed so they left. A mentor finally broke the news:Your website is too complicated.I argued with her&ndash; but I have so many offerings! So many things to say! People need to see this and this and this. After a few minutes of back and forth, she asked me the same question I want to ask you:What&rsquo;s the one thing you want people to do?The answer was (and is) sign up to our newsletter. That was it, so we rebuilt the site around that. You&rsquo;ll notice we point out our newsletter everywhere because that&rsquo;s us trying to keep it simple. So think about these:<li> Your Website: What&rsquo;s the one thing you want people to do?</li><li> Your Elevator Pitch: What&rsquo;s the one thing you want people to know?</li><li> Your First Impression: What&rsquo;s the one thing you want people to feel?</li><h3> #9: 10x Thinking</h3>Small people think small. You are not a small person. You have big dreams, big ideas and big potential. 10x thinking is all about your mindset. How far do you think you can go? How big can you take your ideas? Snow uses a baseball analogy. Don&rsquo;t aim to get to first base, aim to hit a home run. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, big thinking is scary. Big thinking takes courage. But, lets be real:<strong> Be ballsy, it&rsquo;s more fun.</strong>We have precious time on this earth. Why waste it doing small things, not pushing our limits, sticking within our comfort zone? This makes me think about the psychology of <u> <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/07/how-to-be-great/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  How to Be Great </a></u>. In the book <u> Elite Minds</u>, Stan Beecham says if your goal doesn&rsquo;t terrify you a little bit, it&rsquo;s not big enough. Put another way, make your goals so that you are only 40% sure that you can achieve them.Try these:<li> Think about one of your goals, now 10x it.</li><li> Think about one of your goals and change it so you are only 40% sure you can achieve it.</li><li> Do something on your  <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/2015/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-your-bucket-list/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   bucket list  </u>    </a> that scares you just a bit.</li><h3> Science of People Case-Study:</h3>I was sitting with one of my <u> <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/awesome-club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Awesome Clubs </a></u> last week and we were talking about our 5 year plan. During my turn, I said that my goal was to have Science of People trainers around the world. One of my partners wanted me to get measurable (one of the pillars of our goals) and asked, &ldquo;So how many cities?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;All of them.&rdquo; Now, I recognize this is a lot and very, very ambitious but I was taking a note from Shane Snow. 10x thinking.<h3> #10: Transparency</h3>Snow only had 9 chapters in his book. So this last one is from me to you. Transparency. In this post, I have laid it all out for you&ndash;numbers, failures, feelings, behind the scenes stuff. I believe that honesty and transparency accelerates communication and relationships. Truth is the best smartcut.","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-02 17:30:20.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-02 17:30:20.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_seKAWkm.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-shortcuts-successful-people-use/\", \"post_id\": \"9573\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-02 17:30:20\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-02 17:30:20\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-shortcuts-successful-people-use\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9570\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4589\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-02-at-12.41.07-PM-2-copy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1304\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457011800,"author_id":498,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4422,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Financial Advice Business Must Speak up as Hollywood, Politics Tilt Playing Field","link":"financial-advice-business-must-speak-up-as-hollywood-politics-tilt-playing-field","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roxypitaromero?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Roxana Pita-Romero  </a> </u> Hollywood productions, political rhetoric, stock market gyrations and the rise of tech-driven alternatives to the traditional financial advice professional have tilted the playing field against the average RIA firm. As a result, it&rsquo;s more important than ever for these professionals to speak up and assert their value.Let&rsquo;s start with the stock market slump that kicked off 2016 and dampened the mood of investors. This negative outlook is fueling the distrust individuals have with the financial services industry.According to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://pwc.blogs.com/press_room/2014/10/pwc-research-financial-services-industry-faces-bigger-problem-than-lack-of-trust-apathy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study by PwC  </a> </u> , only 28 percent of consumers trust financial advisors. Not only are trust issues running through the business, but 71 percent of Americans say some aspect of talking to a financial adviser scares them, according to a  <u>  <a href=\"http://mcadamfa.com/financial-advisor-phobia-71-percent-of-americans-say-they-are-scared-of-talking-to-a-financial-advisor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   study conducted by Harris Poll  </a> </u> on behalf of McAdam.Turning to the entertainment industry, recent movies and television shows have surely magnified  Americans&rsquo; undesirable views of the financial services sector.In the past few years, the anti-Wall Street sentiment that many are feeling today has been shown from the silver screen to the small screen.</p><h3> The Big Short, The Wolf of Wall Street, Madoff and Money Monster (coming out in May) all provide a deeper look into the misdeeds that have occurred within financial services.</h3>It&rsquo;s clear that there is a growing audience of individuals who want answers (and rightfully so).The narratives portrayed in Hollywood have trumped the relatively less glamorous stories of the many who do work in the best interest of their clients by providing the advice that helps achieve positive outcomes.  Those &ldquo;boring&rdquo; advisors need to speak up for themselves. It is especially important for the financial services industry to focus on communication that builds trust rather than fear.<h3> Here are some ways to take control of the narrative and tell your own story:</h3><li> <strong>  Fine tune how you express your mission:  </strong> Whether your goal is to help consumers secure their retirement income, bring financial advice to mainstream America or help affluent families create a legacy, the first step is defining your mission. Once this is set, create messaging points that clearly relay your objectives to clients, prospects and peers. It all begins with knowing how to articulate what you do and what you strive for.</li><li> <strong>  Use the media to your advantage: </strong>  A strategic media relations campaign lets you proactively get in front of the press and tell your story, even if markets turn sour. Instead of dismissing media inquiries as items that distract you from your business, lend your voice of reason to the coverage that will happen with or without you. By acknowledging clients&rsquo; fears, sharing a level-headed perspective and providing a solution, you attain a level of credibility that sets you apart from other experts who choose to shy away from it.</li><li> <strong>  Get your message out: </strong>  Connect with clients and prospects as much as possible.

The meeting held this past weekend in Shanghai was considered a major disappointment, with no clear resolution reached on how to address slow growth. But this is to be expected. As I&rsquo;ve said before, G20 bankers seem more interested today in synchronizing global taxation and regulation than in balancing monetary and fiscal policies.</p><p> Ironically, though, one of the latest monetary tools&mdash;negative interest rates&mdash;has been a boon to gold prices. As rates have dropped below zero in Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and elsewhere, and with speculation they could be introduced here in the U.S., many investors have moved into, or increased their exposure to, gold. The metal has historically served as a dependable store of value.</p><p> Another driver of prices is the weak economic data that was released this Tuesday. China&rsquo;s purchasing manager&rsquo;s index (PMI) contracted even further in February, falling from 49.4 to 49.0. Meanwhile, the global PMI had a dramatic pullback, dropping to a neutral 50.0, which is its lowest possible reading before manufacturing begins to stagnate.

{"original_id":4425,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Don't Just Leave Money Behind ... Leave a Legacy","link":"dont-just-leave-money-behind-leave-a-legacy","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Baby boomers will leave behind more than $30 trillion over the next 3 decades.</h3><p> <br/> That&rsquo;s a lot of money that holds with it the power to do great things&mdash;or nothing at all. Because while judgment, discipline, and balance are all qualities we hope for in our heirs, let&rsquo;s face it: there&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;d be rolling over in our graves if we could see what happens to all our hard-earned wealth after it passes from our hands to the next generation.</p><p> The first time I saw how quickly an inheritance could vanish was 30 years ago. A new client, Jackie, came to us for help investing a $500K inheritance she&rsquo;d received from her parents. She was just 30 years old, single, and was barely getting by financially while caring for her 9-year-old son, so this gift&mdash;which was worth considerably more back in 1986&mdash;was a wonderful blessing. But while she asked for our guidance, her Hollywood friends convinced her to &ldquo;invest&rdquo; every penny of her inheritance in a new movie. In less than a year, the money was gone. Jackie truly believed she was making the best choice, but her lack of wisdom cost her and her son what could have been significant benefits. Instead of a new home or an education for her son, the only thing Jackie walked away with was a hard-earned lesson in finance.</p><p> Unfortunately, Jackie&rsquo;s story isn&rsquo;t uncommon. If Jackie&rsquo;s parents had left the inheritance in a Trust for the needs of their daughter and grandson, she may have been able to go back to school to get her degree, he may have been able to attend college, or Jackie could have purchased a nice home for them to live in. Instead, the money went up in smoke.</p><p> The simple way to avoid a similar bad ending is to put regulators in place on how, when, and in what way the money we leave behind can be used. Here are 5 steps to get you started:</p><h3> 1. Learn about your beneficiaries&rsquo; values and if they&rsquo;ve demonstrated good judgment in their lives.</h3><p> <br/> Have one-on-one conversations to discuss subjects that often never come up unless you choose to &ldquo;go there.&rdquo; Take your child or grandchild to lunch to chat about major life issues and important values. Have they experienced any debilitating addictions to chemical or alcohol? Is there a history of financial irresponsibility such as not paying back creditors or family members? What about the future? What education would they add if money were not a barrier? What do they wish for their children&rsquo;s education? What charities do they volunteer for, give donations to, or admire?</p><h3> 2. Determine how you want your assets to be used.</h3><p> <br/> While the most common choice is to provide an inheritance directly, with no restrictions on how the money is spent, leaving the money in Trust may be a wiser choice. The specific Trust provisions will determine how the funds can be used. And I recommend writing a letter to the Trustee of the Trust who will have the final say in how and when funds are to be paid out. For instance, if you want your granddaughter to be able to buy a car, provide a general price range in the letter, and remember that specifications are easily updated in the future with the stroke of a pen.</p><h3> 3. Identify the most appropriate Trustee.</h3><p> <br/> Allison is 71 years old and widowed. She has no children of her own, but she has a stepson, Allen, who is 52 years old and not fully functional. When we spoke last week, Allison was about to name Allen as her executor. Knowing him a little and her a lot, I suggested she assign her younger cousin as her Trustee instead. When Allison passes, her cousin will be able to guide Allen&rsquo;s spending and help ensure Allison&rsquo;s legacy isn&rsquo;t squandered. (If you don&rsquo;t have a person in your life whom you feel would be right for the job, consider using a corporate trustee such as a bank).</p><h3> 4. Review your Will to be sure all the pieces are in order.</h3><p> <br/> Perry was recently remarried, and he and his new wife asked us to review their Wills and beneficiaries and make recommendations. It&rsquo;s a good thing! Perry&rsquo;s ex-wife was still listed as his beneficiary even though they&rsquo;d been divorced for more than 15 years. And contact information was missing for his adult children who were also listed as beneficiaries. While it may seem obvious, it&rsquo;s these details that can derail the transfer of your estate when the time comes.</p><h3> 5. Work with your financial advisor and estate attorney to be sure everything is structured according to your wishes. </h3><p> <br/> All too often, a Will or Trust is never even read by the client. Be sure you understand what each document says, and be sure they&rsquo;re structured honor your wishes when you&rsquo;re not around to clarify.</p><p> Andy and Geraldine are a great example of wise planning. When they married in their early 60s, Geraldine had no children, and Andy had two children and three grandchildren. When Andy died at age 72, Geraldine was the beneficiary on the house and his 401(k) and IRA. The life insurance of $150K was payable to an Educational Trust for the benefit of Andy&rsquo;s three grandchildren. As a result, two of his grandchildren were able to fund their degrees at top universities, and the third is now finishing a computer programming degree. The remaining money in the Trust will be paid out next year proportionately to the grandkids.Geraldine is still working and will be quite comfortable when she retires.</p><p> The most basic definition of a legacy is &ldquo;a gift of property or money,&rdquo; but by taking these five basic steps today, you can go a step further: Plan today to ensure you are giving a lasting gift that enables your beneficiaries to fulfill their personal and financial potential.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-02 18:29:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-02 18:29:23.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_FYngJmt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/dont-just-leave-money-behind-leave-a-legacy/\", \"post_id\": \"9582\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-02 18:29:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-02 18:29:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"dont-just-leave-money-behind-leave-a-legacy\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9581\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4594\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dont-Just-Leave-Money-Behind-...-Leave-a-Legacy.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"952\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457013600,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

You haven&rsquo;t made a decision, but you&rsquo;re open (even if reluctantly) to the idea that a change might be warranted.</li><li> In the Preparation Stage you&rsquo;ve made the decision to change and are making plans to change the behavior or situation that isn&rsquo;t serving you.</li><li> In the Action Stage, you&rsquo;re implementing your plan, continuing to adjust it as needed.</li><li> In the Maintenance Stage, you&rsquo;re a few months into the change or new behavior. It&rsquo;s getting easier and beginning to feel more natural.</li><li> In the Relapse Stage, you&rsquo;ve taken a detour to your old behavior or situation.

Determine your stage after reviewing the diagram above. </strong></p><p> <strong>  2. Strengthen your will to change by tapping into the reasons why you want to change now. </strong> Motivation is an emotion. Like any emotion, it can wax and wane. Learn how to maintain motivation  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/goal-motivation-worksheet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  3. Choose from the following: </strong></p><li> If you&rsquo;re in the Contemplation Stage -  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/are-you-ready-to-change\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Consider the advantages and disadvantages </a>  of making a change. Think back to previous attempts to change and the ways these methods helped or fell short.  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/are-you-ready-to-change\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Use this tool to guide you  </u>  . </a></li><li> If you&rsquo;re in the Preparation Stage - Make a realistic plan.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve told my clients (and myself) that sustainable change doesn't happen overnight. Set yourself up for success by creating a start to finish plan that anticipates and addresses the challenges you faced when you made a previous attempt. It may be helpful to talk through your plan with a therapist, coach, or trusted advisor.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re in the Action or Maintenance Stages - Follow you plan and adjust it as necessary. Reach out for support. Change isn&rsquo;t easy. Nobody gets to where they are alone.</li><li> If you&rsquo;re in the Relapse Stage - Focus on self-forgiveness and reach out for support. You may be tempted to give up your plan, but remember that this is an opportunity to learn what doesn&rsquo;t work and alter it accordingly. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4. When you feel ambivalent or lose motivation, amplify the parts of you that want to create change while acknowledging the feelings that have previously kept you stuck. </strong> Tell yourself &ldquo;Even though I would rather watch TV than go for a walk, I know I will feel better after I start.&rdquo; Then, go back to  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/goal-motivation-worksheet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  y  <u>   our list of motivating reasons  </u>  . </a></p><p> <strong>  5. Reach out for support. </strong> Your friends and family want you to succeed! And while most of us suck at asking for help, new results come from taking new actions. </p><h3> The Takeaway: <br/>  </h3><p> Your awareness and motivation are the keys to beating ambivalence and creating lasting change. If you&rsquo;re still on the fence about making a change, it&rsquo;s better to  <a href=\"http://www.alignedholistics.com/are-you-ready-to-change\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  clarify  </a> and plan than to go full steam ahead. Success comes from taking steps that align with your readiness to change.</p>","channel":5,"channel_url":5,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-02 18:36:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-02 18:36:01.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_93222Xu.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-overcome-ambivalence-take-action-now/\", \"post_id\": \"9584\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-02 18:36:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-02 18:36:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-overcome-ambivalence-take-action-now\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9583\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4595\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-Overcome-Ambivalence-Take-Action-Now.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1798\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457024400,"author_id":22,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4428,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Shifting from an “Us\" Website to a “You\" Website","link":"shifting-from-an-us-website-to-a-you-website","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Chances are, your company has at least one competitor, if not several. Even if you serve a narrow niche, your product or service may not be the only solution a buyer has to choose from.</h3><p> <br/> People get overwhelmed when they have more than one choice. Consequently, today&rsquo;s buyer is seeking quality information about and solutions to their problems, especially in a setting where there&rsquo;s risk.</p><p> Today&rsquo;s buyer uses the internet to research products, services and viable alternatives. Only after a customer believes your company offers a possible solution will the proprietary nuts-and-bolts of goods or services become relevant.</p><p> As you contemplate the design and content of your website, consider whether it is focused on praising your company or on demonstrating real value to your visitor. If you find you need to shift to a &ldquo;you&rdquo; website design (more customer-focused), use these techniques to attract, retain and convert your website traffic into leads for your business.</p><h3> Update Your Copy</h3><p> <br/> Over time virtually all website copy can become out of date and ineffective.</p><p> For that reason, you need to re-read your website periodically and make adjustments to what it says. Some questions to ask might be:</p><li> Have you added products or services since your website was re-launched? Are they all included?</li><li> Should you update areas of the site with information about new product or service lines?</li><li> Are you no longer offering some products or services, and have mentions of those been removed everywhere?</li><li> Does your homepage talk about what you do, or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/website-chasing-away-new-business-opportunities/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   what your customers want  </a> </u>  (benefit-driven copy)?</li><li> Does your website use words or acronyms that only people at your company would understand? <br/>  </li><p> Outdated information or statements that are too specific to your company can interfere with the connection between your website and your target audience.</p><p> Both the homepage and landing pages are crucial. Ensure that your landing pages answer your customer&rsquo;s top questions. Do you address price? Do you address delivery of your product or service?</p><h3> Improve Navigation</h3><p> <br/> Making it easy to get from one page to another is only the first step in making sure your customer can navigate your website. A &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; used to be to give visitors links to everything as quickly as possible. The more links, the better.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not the case anymore. The trend for corporate websites is to post more information that ever, meaning that websites are growing. If you link to everything on every page, things get too complicated.</p><p> Instead, consider the 2-3 next steps a reasonable person might want to accomplish as they navigate your website. Does your website present too many options that might confuse people?</p><h3> Reframe Your Objectives to Reflect Your Customer&rsquo;s Ideal Situation</h3><p> <br/> Your ultimate goal is to satisfy your customers, so your copy should describe the benefits they&rsquo;ll receive when they use your product or service.</p><p> Online consumers are looking for a solution to their current challenge. To grab their attention, your site should display the solutions offered by your products and services, not just the data about them. Tell them about the problems your company solves using their words, not yours.</p><p> Think of it this way. People use catalogs when they know what parts they need to order. A catalog is a product reference. Your website, however, is a tool to help customers make decisions about what&rsquo;s right for them. That means you have to list more than services you offer or products you sell. Part numbers won&rsquo;t help customers that are looking at a wide range of solutions.</p><h3> Clean Up Typography and Landscape</h3><p> <br/> Websites that are cluttered or disorganized pose additional problems. Information becomes hard to find, and they often load more slowly than other websites.</p><p> Potential customers researching your products and services have notoriously short attention spans and will navigate to another site rather than wait for yours to load fully or sort through pages of cluttered information.</p><p> Flashing ads, pop-ups and unexpected videos that &ldquo;auto-play&rdquo; can distract viewers from engaging with your content. In contrast, fewer words, larger fonts and clean lettering set off by plenty of white space will make your content easier to scan, read and comprehend.</p><p> Remember that people scan websites, not read them. Be careful to include customer-focused impact statements in headlines rather than in small type.</p><p> Shifting from an &ldquo;us&rdquo; website to a &ldquo;you&rdquo; website provides a better experience for your potential customers. Satisfied readers might just become your next satisfied customers.</p><p>  </p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-02 18:49:43.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-02 18:49:43.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_8OapNWH.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/shifting-from-an-us-website-to-a-you-website/\", \"post_id\": \"9588\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-02 18:49:43\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-02 18:49:43\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"shifting-from-an-us-website-to-a-you-website\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9587\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4597\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Shifting-from-an-\\u201cUs\\u201d-Website-to-a-\\u201cYou\\u201d-Website.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"351\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457035200,"author_id":400,"chart_url":""}

Not sure why they ask me, as I haven&rsquo;t started a start-up, but I guess it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m seeing 100s of start-ups out there. </p><h3> For example, there were 800 contenders on the shortlist for the Fintech50 this year, and that&rsquo;s just the shortlist in Fintech.</h3><p> <br/> Tech City claims there are 40,000 tech companies in London alone, with 45,000 more planned to join them over the next ten years.  So near 100,000 companies employing 300,000 people and generating billions of investment and entrepreneurial vision.  Great.  Same in Silicon Valley.  There are various estimates, but  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-many-tech-startups-are-there-in-the-US-and-how-many-people-do-they-employ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quora  </a> </u>  gives you the number of a million tech startups in the USA employing 5 million people.  Of these start-ups, Silicon Valley is where it&rsquo;s at as the area attracts 14,000 to 19,000 startups  <u>  <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2015/07/28/startups-cities-rankings-silicon-valley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   per year  </a> </u> , compared to the American metro average of 4,000.</p><h3> Wow!  Startups everywhere.  Which will succeed? </h3><p> <br/> You can probably tell by just watching Shark Tank or Dragon&rsquo;s Den, shows that reflect the rise of start-up entrepreneurialism over the past decade.</p><p> In these shows, they always rattle the financial numbers, which is a mono-focus.  They say they invest if they like the guys, which is a subjective focus.  They sometimes want to jump in because they like the concept, product or idea, which is an instinctual focus.</p><p> I have four criteria by which to judge a start-up: business model, technical capability, financial structure and managerial acumen.</p><p> First, is the thing they are doing fundamentally different and will it fly?  An example of this is P2P lending.  It is different and it will fly as long as they manage credit risk effectively.  Credit risk is a technical capability, which leads to second point: is this going to work technically?</p><p> A lot of people are cynical about TransferWise because the concept began with swapping data about money across borders, and that does not work.  It does not work because finding two people at the exact same second in two spots worldwide who need the exact same money swapped is highly unlikely to work.  As a result, many have trashed the idea of TransferWise.  TransferWise is making heavy losses as it  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/12127486/TransferWise-losses-widen-sixfold-after-massive-growth-push.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   aims for growth  </a> </u>  but, even so, it&rsquo;s difficult to justify a $10 million business being worth  <u>  <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/transferwises-2015-accounts-show-small-revenue-2016-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   over $1 billion  </a>  . </u></p><p> According to Nick England, a 15 year veteran of the international currency exchange (FX) sector and founder of VFX, a currency exchange handling over $50 million a day, TransferWise is just &ldquo; <u>  smoke and mirrors </u> &rdquo;.   I agree with him to an extent, but he bases his comments on the idea that TransferWise is based upon being a peer-to-peer currency exchange which he claims is conceptually broken.  But P2P exchange is not TransferWise&rsquo;s business.  TransferWise run three-quarters of their FX trade through Currency Cloud and do this in order to offer a low-cost, high tech FX system, rather than a P2P exchange.  They have also changed direction somewhat.  For example, the latest announcement of their partnership with German neobanks Number26 is fascinating.</p><p> Number26 aims to create a  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/02/number26-the-peter-thiel-backed-mobile-banking-startup-expands-across-e-u-into-6-new-markets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   pan-European mobile first bank  </a> </u> , and is backed by heavy guns like Peter Thiel.  Teaming up with TransferWise, backed by Richard Branson, TransferWise will be the seamless money transfer service plugged into Number26 &ndash; you don&rsquo;t use TransferWise visibly in the mobile app &ndash; to allow transfers from Euros to U.K. pounds, U.S. dollars, Swedish krona, Indian rupees, Australian dollars, Hungarian forints, Swiss francs, Polish zloty and additional currencies in  <u>  <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/25/the-bank-that-fintech-built-number26-and-transferwise-team-up-to-re-invent-banking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the near future  </a> </u> .</p><p> Cool.</p><p> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Transferwise.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Transferwise\" src=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Transferwise-1024x476.jpg?3226c1\"/> </a></p><p> So what Thiel and Branson are investing in is the potential here, and there is huge potential for the low-cost, high-volume market of FX, a $5 trillion daily volume marketplace.</p><p> Then there are the financials.  This is where you have the hardest job because companies like TransferWise, along with all the other Fintech and Tech start-ups, are investing in long-term growth opportunity at the expense of short-term profit.  This is why many of them run at loss-leader rate for their early years until they eventually establish themselves as the One.  Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are all the One&rsquo;s of their time, with Amazon being the most notable loss leader of all.</p><p> Amazon&rsquo;s pretty much  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/topics/846/amazon/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   never made a cent of profit:  </a> </u></p><p> <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/4298/amazons-long-term-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" Amazon's Relentless Focus on Long-Term Growth | Statista\" src=\"https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_4298_amazons_long_term_growth_n.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> And yet according to Forbes, Amazon is the eighth most  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/innovative-companies/list/\" target=\"_blank\">   innovative company  </a> </u>  in the world; the thirteenth  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list/\" target=\"_blank\">   most valuable global brand  </a> </u> ; the 458th largest company in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/\" target=\"_blank\">   Global 2000  </a> </u> ; #80  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/#header:revenue_sortreverse:true\" target=\"_blank\">   for Sales  </a> </u> ; #435 for <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/#header:assets_sortreverse:true\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   Assets  </u> </a> ; #34  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/#header:marketValue_sortreverse:true\" target=\"_blank\">   in Market Value  </a> </u>  ($175 billion) and one of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/best-employers/list/\" target=\"_blank\">   America&rsquo;s Best Employers  </a> </u>  (#329).</p><h3> Is this madness?</h3><p> <br/> For any other market maybe, but the recognition of brands like Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon is they are gateway companies. They own their space and are continually expanding that space.  Until their space is complete, they have to reinvest to fend off any new market entrants.</p><p> Equally, Amazon is not just one company but a bundle of companies from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to books and a whole load in between.  Some of these companies make huge profit, some make small margin but huge volume, and some are start-up growth companies in the network.  Therefore, for a better view of Amazon&rsquo;s model, you need to look  <a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  under the hood </a> , and what you seen is Amazon re-investing profits in start-ups.  That&rsquo;s a great model and one that the Thiel&rsquo;s and Branson&rsquo;s understand which is why they invest in blockchain and P2P and TransferWise.</p><p> So finally you need to look at the guys who run the company.</p><p> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Silicon-Valley.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Silicon Valley\" src=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Silicon-Valley.jpg?3226c1\"/> </a></p><h3> Do they have the managerial, financial, technical and business acumen to create a Unicorn? </h3><p> <br/> If not, can you mentor them to fill the gaps.  Bring in a good CEO who can do the financials and operations, whilst they build the business and technical structure.</p><p> What better example of this than Google? Serge and Larry, the founders, had no idea how to monetize Google until they brought in Eric Schmidt.  Serge and Larry, researchers by nature at the time, had gained VC investments and had grown to 200 employees by 2001, but didn&rsquo;t know where to take the company to build it into what it is today.

We work for long hours, telling ourselves that as long as we have caffeine or motivation, our energy will go on and on.</p><p> It won&rsquo;t. </p><p> To achieve maximum productivity, you must manage your energy. That&rsquo;s the message of Allison Green Schoop, associate strategy director at global design firm frog.</p><p> So how do you manage your energy? Look at it as sprints and recovery. We all know we are going to have big sprints &mdash; that&rsquo;s what makes pursuing a project or business so exciting. The balance between sprints and recovery is key in being your most productive.</p><h3> To Manage the Sprints: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Monitor your energy levels.  </strong> We all have different internal rhythms: Some of us are night owls, while others&rsquo; brains shut down after 10 p.m. To find out what time of day your energy levels are at their peak, try setting your smartphone to beep every hour and note what you&rsquo;re doing, how your energy is and what might have affected it, such as whether you just ate a huge, carb-heavy lunch. At the end of a week, assess your notes and look for patterns.</p><p> <strong>  Don&rsquo;t force it.  </strong> Once you know your natural energy rhythms, try to honor them. If you experience a 3 p.m. slump every day, for example, trying to power through it will do more harm than good. You won&rsquo;t be working efficiently, your results will be poor, and you&rsquo;ll drain even more energy from your mind and body. Instead, during a slump time, try taking a quick walk or doing stretches in your office.</p><p> <strong>  Adjust accordingly.  </strong> You don&rsquo;t have to be a slave to your energy levels, of course. Test different ways of energizing yourself, such as exercising, eating different foods, getting lots of water or sleeping more to find out what works best for you. One of my friends finally motivated herself to work out every morning when she realized that doing so eliminated the 3 p.m. slump that had plagued her for years.</p><h3> To Make Room for Recovery: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Schedule it. </strong>  No matter whether or not you think you need a break, schedule fun or relaxation activities in advance and stick to them.</p><p> <strong>  Double the break you think you need.  </strong> You might say, &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll take a break this evening&mdash; I&rsquo;ll give myself a whole hour off!&rdquo; Not good enough. Whatever the break you think you need, double it. You are most likely underestimating the toll that all of your hard work is taking on your body and mind &mdash; even if you&rsquo;re having fun.</p><p> <strong>  Enlist family and friends.  </strong> If you schedule a weekend get-away with family or friends, you&rsquo;ll have no excuse but to unplug. Family and friends can be great accountability buddies for taking the breaks you need.</p><p> <strong>  Break down your biggest goals. </strong> Make them into achievable, measurable chunks and reward yourself often! For every day that you make a massive to-do list, add a &ldquo;reward&rdquo; item at the end that brings you joy.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-02 19:49:47.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-02 19:49:47.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_KNLgTeI.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/you-have-energy-heres-how-to-best-manage-it/\", \"post_id\": \"9591\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-02 19:49:47\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-02 19:49:47\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"you-have-energy-heres-how-to-best-manage-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9590\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4599\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Running_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"419\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457031600,"author_id":435,"chart_url":""}

Did you ever want to get someone else involved in financial decisions but thought you couldn&rsquo;t because of privacy rules?</p><p> The average advisor has seven clients with some form of diminished capacity. Perhaps you are one of them, not comfortable with the privacy laws that restrict you from calling in someone to help when your client doesn&rsquo;t seem all there anymore.</p><p> If you are worried that you must just stand by and watch a vulnerable client make bad decisions, or worse, get ripped off by someone who is manipulating him and taking advantage of his cognitive impairment, there&rsquo;s good news. There is a way around the confidentiality conundrum.

When we have a conflict that would be there unless we get an ok from our clients, we design a document that allows the client to give up the right she would otherwise have.

You can do the same thing with privacy restrictions.</p><p> Imagine that you have some clients over the age of 65. Imagine that you are a proactive thinker.

Please hold for the next available agent.&rdquo; And, then they make their clients hold for a length of time that would make most people wonder if their call really was important to them.</p><p> Or how about when you finally do get to the client support rep and they don&rsquo;t treat you like a person. They are impersonal and treat you like an account number. They answer the call with a stoic and less than enthusiastic tone of voice and follow with a series of impersonal questions about your account number, the last four digits of your social security and your mother&rsquo;s maiden name, only then do they ask what they can help you with.</p><p> It frustrates me when the client service people act with apathy. Don&rsquo;t they care about us? After all, aren&rsquo;t we the people that pay their salary? Don&rsquo;t they know what their job is?</p><h3> Here is my thought. Even though they were hired to answer questions and solve problems, they actually have a number of very important responsibilities. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  They are hired to solve customer problems. </strong> Isn&rsquo;t that what client service people usually do?</li><li> <strong>  They are role models for others to emulate. </strong> Good behavior leads to more good behavior. Unfortunately the opposite is also true. So, when employees step up and deliver a great service experience for their customers, it sets the example for others in the company. It has a contagious effect as others catch the passion that these excellent employees have for helping their customers.</li><li> <strong>  They are brand ambassadors for the company they work for. </strong> This goes beyond the hours that employees spend at work. A brand ambassador is a 24/7 job. Never speaking badly of the company, these excellent customer-focused employees always take advantage of opportunities to talk up their employer.</li><li> <strong>  They make their customers feel like customers. </strong> While any given client may not be the biggest or most important client that they have, they should never make them feel as if they are anything less than important. And for the few minutes they are interacting with their client, they may make them feel like he or she is their most important.</li><li> <strong>  They must restore confidence. </strong> This one may be the most important of all. Solving their clients&rsquo; problems is expected. The key is to do it in such a way that also restores confidence. That means with the right attitude, a sense of caring, empathy and urgency. <br/>  </li><p> I spoke with Janet Poklemba, a customer experience manager for a home warranty company at a recent conference.

I was tired of my generation being ignored by the personal finance industry. I was put off by the outdated information touted by people my grandparents&rsquo; ages &ndash; and, frankly, I was 100% irritated with the media&rsquo;s stance that our generation &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t want financial advice.&rdquo;<h3> I was lucky enough to actually major in money in college.</h3>Not surprisingly, however, most people have other passions to pursue. I realized early on that there&rsquo;s a huge disconnect between today&rsquo;s education system and financial planning firms and the availability and accessibility of financial information and guidance for this age group. Translation: There is none.After 12 years in the personal finance industry, one of the biggest things I&rsquo;ve learned is that people need clear-cut guidance. It&rsquo;s exhausting to sit through meetings full of fancy lingo or to spend hours digging through online articles trying to figure out where to start and which advice is the best advice or applies to your unique situation. The internet can only offer up so much information.

{"original_id":4435,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Overcoming the Fear Factor","link":"overcoming-the-fear-factor","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Fear, at a basic physiological level, is the perception (thought or assumption) that an external threat to one&rsquo;s well being exists.  This in turn mobilizes the body&rsquo;s &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mechanism.  The body&rsquo;s fight or flight response is activated by the production of large amounts of the hormone Cortisol (the body&rsquo;s stress hormone). When experiencing a fear response, people are naturally more likely to exhibit defensive or aggressive behavior to release the tension. Frequently it is misplaced.</p><p> In short, we go into hyper-emotional response, which exaggerates the fear to see the worst-case scenario, and a threat. This response may or may not have validity. In many cases, fear is our imagination on steroids.</p><h3> THE SYMPTOMS OF FEAR <br/>  </h3><p> The symptoms of people experiencing fear responses may be subtle or extreme. Some examples of fear behavior in the workplace include the following, and the possible reasons: </p><h3> &ldquo;Us versus them&rdquo; talk.</h3><p> Fear of the other.</p><h3> Silence during meetings, but widespread talk outside of meetings.</h3><p> Insecurity about expressing an opinion in public for fear of judgment or ridicule. </p><h3> Resistance to new ideas.</h3><p> I could fail, and then I&rsquo;d look ridiculous.</p><h3> Lowered productivity, increased mistakes/waste.</h3><p> Inability to perform. Low self-esteem, morale.</p><h3> Increased absences and tardiness.</h3><p> Fear of admitting I hate my job. Unwilling to make a change.</p><h3> Defensiveness regarding performance appraisal.</h3><p> Insecurity about role or status. Fear of loss</p><h3> Reluctance to admit mistakes.</h3><p> Fear of failure and needs to be right.</p><h3> Tendency to blame the environment or others for a host of issues.</h3><p> Not taking responsibility for fear of being judged.</p><h3> Negative attitudes regarding the organization and/or its customers.</h3><p> See above.</p><h3> Indecisiveness or reluctance to take risks.</h3><p> Fear of failure. </p><h3> Denial of tensions and conflicts which are at or near the surface.</h3><p> Fear of confrontation.</p><p> There are many things that can trigger our fear response, and frequently they are related to fundamental emotional reactions. These include fear of loss, abandonment, rejection, humiliation and the fear of failure.</p><p> Next time your fear shows up, ask yourself is it real or imagined? Do I have empirical evidence that the outcome from a certain situation will be in the negative? </p><p> By examining your reaction to assumptions and behaviors that have triggered a defensive, fearful response, you are consciously choosing to communicate in a more positive, proactive manner. By changing how you react to events in your life, you can become more open, more communicative, more confident, and more collaborative in all your approach to your work, family and life in general.</p><p> Being fearless is not the absence of fear, but the choices and decisions we make when fear shows up in our lives. Remember, fear for the most part is our overactive imagination at work.</p><p> Be Fearless: See Where It Gets You!!!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 17:22:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 17:22:15.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_yKszajG.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/overcoming-the-fear-factor/\", \"post_id\": \"9601\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 17:22:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 17:22:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"overcoming-the-fear-factor\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9600\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4604\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Overcoming-the-Fear-Factor.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"772\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457114400,"author_id":206,"chart_url":""}

That goes for both good and bad news!</p><h3> Recently Starbucks announced a change in their highly regarded loyalty program and I heard both praise and deep criticism.</h3>Sadly, I felt very old because in 2004 the mere mention of a loyalty program at Starbucks was not well-received.In those days of yore, leaders were concerned about decreasing product value by giving away a 13thdrink to customers who had purchased 12.  There is nothing like a recession for brands to embrace the need to reward customers for loyal behavior.In the recent change to the Starbucks loyalty program, the company is moving toward a reward system based on customer spend not simply based on customers making a set number of purchases.  Rather than giving a customer a &ldquo;high priced item for free&rdquo; after that customer purchases a set number of potentially low priced items, Starbucks will link rewards to the dollar amount a customer actually spends.  While this change makes intuitive sense the data will determine the wisdom of the move (Something tells me there have been ample number of financial projections run to support the change).Given the large number of editorials and commentaries written about the Starbucks loyalty modification, I thought I might address key elements of a successful loyalty program.<h3> 1) Know What Target Customers Value</h3>Like most aspects of business, success in loyalty program creation begins with listening. You have to know what your target customer groups want in order to set-up an effective reward structure.<h3> 2) Drive Profitability</h3>Every customer should be treated caringly and with respect.  That said, high-value and incipient high-value customers should be rewarded for and encouraged to enjoy as many of your products and services as possible.  Customers who are engaged with your brand should have their contributions to your proitability rewarded.<h3> 3) Study Game Theory and Intermittent Reinforcement Principles</h3>Game theory and psychological principles of intermittent reinforcement are helpful in capturing and retaining the attention of participants in your loyalty program.  Think of slot machines, as the classic example of intermittent reinforcement (the machines pay off with enough frequency to keep people in front of them).  Panera bread has a loyalty program which motivates customer behavior through intermittent reinforcement.  As for game theory, reward programs benefit from many components like mastery, setting levels, immediate recognition, and the ability to celebrate in one&rsquo;s own social network.<h3> 4) Set Clear Attainable Rewards</h3>Put simply the more complicated the rules the less effective the reward structure.<h3> 5) Make it Fun</h3>This is about rewards and playfulness.  It is not about the more serious aspects of business.  At Starbucks, the reward program was first jazzed up on the mobile app by having the customer scorecard reflect stars that fall into an on-screen cup.  Designers jazzed it up further by having the stars bounce around in the cup as a customer changes the orientation of their mobile device.<h3> The wisdom of Starbucks loyalty program changes will ultimately be reflected in customer return visit frequency and customer spend.</h3>The wisdom of our programs will, in part, be reflected in how well-we adhere to the key elements highlighted above!","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 17:39:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 17:39:29.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_HbHYyR3.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/did-the-sky-fall-when-starbucks-changed-its-loyalty-program/\", \"post_id\": \"9602\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 17:39:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 17:39:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"did-the-sky-fall-when-starbucks-changed-its-loyalty-program\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9600\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4605\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Overcoming-the-Fear-Factor.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"504\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457100000,"author_id":249,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4438,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Transformation Without Change?","link":"transformation-without-change","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by: Dr. Rosie Kuhn</p><p> What is it really like to be on a spiritual journey &ndash; one of transformation? The truth is: It is hard friggin&rsquo; work, and sometimes, it hurts like HELL.</p><p> We think transformation is easy. It seems as though it&rsquo;s something that just happens, right? Like miracles and magic. It&rsquo;s as if we have to do nothing, and all of a sudden &ndash; presto-change-o, we are transformed. We imagine that with transformation comes a life that is easy and effortless, and that there is no more hard work to be done.</p><p> Change, on the other hand, occurs through conscious choice-making. This obviously requires consciousness, which means you have to start by cultivating a desire to be awake, aware and open to what is. Change doesn&rsquo;t occur on its own; it requires conscious choice. I know I&rsquo;m repeating myself, but this consciousness piece is a very important factor.</p><h3> Cultivating the Desire to be Conscious</h3><p> <br/> Choosing to be awake is a choice that requires a change in perspective. This in itself is costly to the egoist-self. When you change perspective, you start perceiving and witnessing as a witness, separate from the reality you thought was real. This can create a conundrum &ndash; doing I want what I have, or do I want what I don&rsquo;t yet have, and may not want, further down the road.</p><p> Choosing to be conscious and awake to the plethora of possibilities one could choose to believe to be real, leads to having to take inventory of all that has been true, or believed to be true. This, more often than not, leads to some hard bumps, as this sorting process channels one toward that choice-point, where change takes place. This choice-point leads to the next step, where one chooses a different perspective, thought, or action, only in service to what is fundamentally known to be true.</p><h3> The Risks of Choosing Change</h3><p> <br/> Every time we consider choosing change, we face a long list of risks and consequences that may befall us. Humiliation, heartbreak, grief and loss arise, as the dismantling of the personal paradigm shifts and unravels. All of the threads that had been woven together over lifetimes begin fraying, thinning and disintegrating over time, as a maturing-self begins to see what couldn&rsquo;t be seen before. You find yourself realizing that the consensus reality doesn&rsquo;t fit you anymore.</p><p> Choosing to awaken, choosing to see what is, from your own unique perspective, requires the steps of letting go of what no longer serves you. You have to choose to release yourself from those dreams, wishes, hopes and beliefs you so desperately wanted to be real. Every fiber of your being is attached to the way you made-believe it to be, and it is excruciating when you begin to separate yourself out from that, knowing nothing more than the mere fact that you are not that.</p><h3> Change takes conscious choice. Change takes intentional focus, commitment, faith and discipline.</h3><p> <br/> Change feels as though you are suffering and that it isn&rsquo;t worth the pain, and agony that you are enduring. This is when most of us begin screaming for the sweet taste of transformation.</p><p> Rarely does transformation take place within a heartbeat. Transformation is founded upon what has been built through intentional processing and change. I&rsquo;ve seen and heard many stories about instant transformational experiences. The fact of the matter is that, many of those transformations were not sustainable because they didn&rsquo;t have the foundation or infrastructure to hold all that the experience of transformation brought with it.</p><p> Those who truly know and speak of transformation have done the legwork. They&rsquo;ve been intentional and committed and have endured the conscious choice-making process. Those who&rsquo;ve experienced transformation often forget all that had gone on before, which prepared them for this moment. They forgot how they had felt lost, or in a maelstrom with pieces of their lives flying in all directions. They forgot that they had made choices that, at the time, seemed insignificant and unimportant. They minimized the courage it took to choose differently, from those around them, who thought them foolish. It didn&rsquo;t occur to them that during the grieving over their loss that they were opening up to an expanded capacity to be in the world in such a way that allowed the fullest expression of their essential nature.</p><p> Believing in your dreams, enough to change, takes will, surrender and faith. It takes conviction that its worth letting go of what no longer works, for what you truly believe in, no matter how far into the unknown you have to go.</p><p> Personally, sometimes, after receiving the best news ever, is when I plummet the furthest. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to make sense at the time, but through experience I&rsquo;ve come to understand that as I keep choosing to change and push the edge of my comfort zone, I have to clear out clutter and reboot. It&rsquo;s sort of like when installing the latest updates on your computer and you have to restart. Sometimes your computer crashes and you gotta start all over again. Sometimes.</p><h3> If you want transformation you have to be willing to change.</h3><p> <br/> You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to have whatever it is you say you want. Transformation, or change is not for sissies; but, no one on Earth came here to be weak and pathetic. Sometimes it feels like a good option, for a while, but more often than not, all of us will choose to change, doing whatever it takes to live fully into our exquisiteness.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 18:11:36.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 18:11:36.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_aHvQ2yK.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/transformation-without-change/\", \"post_id\": \"9605\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 18:11:36\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 18:11:36\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"transformation-without-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9600\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4607\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Overcoming-the-Fear-Factor.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"466\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457118000,"author_id":46,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4439,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"A Financial Advisor's Guide to Engaging Millennials","link":"a-financial-advisors-guide-to-engaging-millennials","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In my <u>  <a href=\"/fintech-center/digital-strategy/why-financial-advisors-need-to-engage-millennials-now\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   last article  </a> </u> , I discussed why it was important for Financial Advisors to engage millennials in 2016.  But let&rsquo;s face it, sparking up a conversation about future investments with a typical millennial &ndash; who can&rsquo;t think beyond their student debt &ndash; isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing to do.</p><h3> So When It Comes to Their Finances, How Can You Connect with Millennials and Keep Them Engaged?</h3><strong> The answer is simple - Get to Know Them and Think Outside the Box!</strong>Okay, that was the short answer, but the first part is nothing new, right?  As Financial Advisors, part of the job is building and maintaining relationships with your clients/prospects and gaining their trust.  It means you&rsquo;re thoroughly understanding their behaviors, goals, expectations, fears, and essentially finding your place in their comfort zone.  Once you establish yourself as a valuable and consistent contributor, trust and loyalty follow.  So with this next generation, the concept still remains the same, but the approach has to change.<strong> Thinking Outside the Box - Here are 3 Strategies That Will Help You Make Your Mark on Millennials:</strong><h3> Connect the Dots</h3>Invest some time in college students that are gearing up to graduate.  Although they won&rsquo;t have the investible assets you&rsquo;re looking for, it&rsquo;s a phase in their life when they need help connecting the dots.  Personal finance is typically not discussed in high schools and colleges throughout the US &ndash; in fact only 17 states require high school students to take a financial literacy course &ndash; so your expertise is most certainly welcomed.  But it&rsquo;s all about your approach!  Calling your current clients&rsquo; children and lecturing them about money management is not going to leave a lasting impression.  How about searching your LinkedIn network to gather some leaders who are beer enthusiasts and hosting a &lsquo;craft beer&rsquo; networking event at the local university bar (if you can find alumni, even better).  To market the event, use social media, work with the university, or advertise at the local bar, and you&rsquo;ll surely get a turnout.  Once the bar is buzzing about beer, do a quick ice breaker to casually slip in introductions, and set up the night by plotting your leaders throughout the room to just&hellip;waitfor it&hellip;TALK.  Personal finance will naturally come up as they candidly chat about their future - student loans, job offers, moving out of college and into a new apt (or back home), travel plans, etc.  Your job here is to listen, get to know them, and see if they&rsquo;re interested in staying in touch.  Afterwards, continue to cultivate the relationship through relatable, educational content or keep connecting the dots (if John from University X just accepted a job offer at Google, introduce him to Sarah from University Y who will also be working at Google).  Millennials are always up for meeting new people, so your timely and collaborative nature will be much appreciated.<h3> Use Your Assets</h3>Remember that the average millennial is more attracted to a fintech solution than you.  The odds are somewhat against you since the technology is cheaper, more transparent, and reliable.  However, you do have a few advantages that you need to play up.  For one, you&rsquo;re a human who has emotions, engages in conversations, makes moments, learns from experiences, and most importantly has a network of other humans.  These are your assets.  So use your human characteristics to make the most of the relationships you currently have with your baby boomer clients to get to know their children.  As your clients begin transitioning into retirement, ask to include their sons/daughters in the next few meetings.  This way you can introduce yourself to the millennials and learn more about their short/long-term goals.  Be sure to do some detective work on social media to look for any past or future life-changing events before talking to them.  If you find something (like engagement pictures on Facebook), make it a note to congratulate them and genuinely take interest in the occasion (don&rsquo;t forget to ask when the big day is so you can surprise the couple with a wedding present &ndash; a roboadvisor can&rsquo;t do this!).  Then, with follow-ups, offer to tap into your network to help them make their event perfect (recommend photographers, caterers, or even connect them to other newlyweds in the area).  These genuine gestures will go a long way when they&rsquo;re finally ready to think about their assets!Use your brilliantly nurtured network to connect young entrepreneurs to investors, job seekers to recruiters, and like-minded dreamers to experienced doers&hellip;it will add value, authenticity, and trust in your relationships and your brand!<h3> Don&rsquo;t Judge</h3>Now that you have successfully proved yourself to be a consistent contributor, it&rsquo;s time to get a sense of their financial comfort level.  In order to do this, you have to accept millennial habits, adapt to their needs, and most importantly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t judge&rsquo;.  There are 3 kinds of millennial investors &ndash; those that prefer the &lsquo;Do-it-yourself&rsquo; (DIY) approach, others that favor an advisor-driven model, and lastly the ones that desire the hybrid strategy (both DIY and advisor-driven).  Work with your young investors to understand which method works best for them, and be transparent, not only about your fees, but also about general processes, strategies, and concerns.  The best way to be clear and explain things to millennials is through technology, so when establishing or reviewing financial objectives, let the technology do all the talking.  If they&rsquo;re able to see how their goals line up against their financial wellness and then effortlessly run &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; scenarios to make informed decisions through an interactive experience, it&rsquo;s quite powerful.  Also, if you&rsquo;re an advisor that leans on these kinds of collaborative planning portals, you&rsquo;re not only scoring points with millennials because you&rsquo;re using fintech-like apps, but you&rsquo;re also showing them that you&rsquo;re not prematurely judging their goals.  Once you&rsquo;re able to have honest conversations with your young clients/prospects, continue to keep engaging them.  Unlike your baby boomer clients who prefer to be contacted on a quarterly basis, Gen Y is a bit more needy&hellip;so be sure to make them feel like you&rsquo;re constantly accessible via email, social media, Skype, text messages, content posts, and most certainly in person (did I mention we&rsquo;re needy &ndash; don&rsquo;t judge!).","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 18:19:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 18:19:11.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_nFLhw7Q.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/a-financial-advisors-guide-to-engaging-millennials/\", \"post_id\": \"9607\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 18:19:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 18:19:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"a-financial-advisors-guide-to-engaging-millennials\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9606\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4608\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/A-Financial-Advisor\\u2019s-Guide-to-Engaging-Millennials.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1061\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457154000,"author_id":444,"chart_url":""}

But the truth is that a partnership can perform very well even when the partners do not have clearly defined complementary skills.  In most cases a leader can hire someone with the skills they need. What partnerships have trouble surviving is a lack of complementary thinking styles.</p><p> Since research on business partners is sparse, we often adapt the comparably vast amounts of research on teams and leadership, and sometimes on marriage, to help business partners work well together. In an article published late last year in the Harvard Business Review, called &ldquo;What Kind of Thinker are You?&rdquo;  Mark Boncheck and Elisa Steele looked at how teams think in terms of big-picture vs. detail-focus, as well as how team members approach process, ideas, actions and relationships. Their goal was to address the fact that &ldquo;how teams think together,&rdquo; rather than the roles they play, &ldquo;most determines their performance.&rdquo;  </p><p> We have found this to be true in partnerships, as well.  Understanding how business partners think is critical since so much of the value from a partnerships is getting a different perspective for better decisions and well-vetted ideas.  There are mountains of data suggesting that the best decisions are reached through rigorous discussion and testing that comes from people who look at problems differently.  An important element of this ability to debate issues well together is that it works best when decision-makers share some underlying core values. Without some aligned values partners may dismiss the divergent views that will help them come to the best decisions.</p><h3> We look at how partners think by distilling a combination of: <br/>  </h3><li> How they behave</li><li> What drives them</li><li> How they relate to others <br/>  </li><p> The psychometric testing we do for business partners is not meant to be provide a remedy for partnerships that are struggling or a checklist for those just starting out, but is an extremely useful tool.  More than anything the results open a discussion among partners about what the results mean to them and to their partnership.

{"original_id":4441,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"LOVE: Estate Planning's Four-Letter Word","link":"love-estate-plannings-four-letter-word","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I've worked with many estate planners throughout the years&mdash;both to organize my own affairs and for business. And I've noticed an interesting phenomena. <strong>  It seems the financial services community hides behind elaborate jargon in favor of addressing the emotional reasons their clients are sitting in front of them. </strong></p><p> They'll talk about non-revocable trusts, captive insurance companies, family offices, foundations, executors, nominees, and on and on. Each structure has it's pros and cons and attorneys will talk in circles about tax implications, asset protection, ease of distribution and control, and so on. And I get it, the U.S. tax code is so long no one could possibly be an expert about every minute detail. It's easy to be sued in the U.S. (the average business owner is sued every 7 years). There's a lot of paranoia surrounding estate planning, as there should be. You never know what land mines you'll run into if your structures are not set up correctly.</p><h3> There is, however, a glaring element missing from most estate plans. That element is love.</h3><p> <br/> Most people see an estate planner for one major reason: they want their assets to be passed on to their heirs or to benefit a cause they care about. They sit down with an attorney because they are compelled to organize their affairs for the best possible outcome for those they care about.</p><p> It's not about saving taxes and making sure your vintage car collection doesn't end up in probate. That's just means to an end. In the end, it's about ensuring your children have the opportunity to build an above-average life. It's about helping fund the cure for cancer or give scholarships to students in need at the college you once attended. <strong>  It's about meaning. </strong></p><p> Although you can distribute your assets in accordance with your values, with traditional estate planning most of your values are lost. What ends up happening is your attorney writes up a document with a long list of stipulations and your daughter, for example, ends up with a trust in her name that doesn't allow her to access the money until she's eighteen and only for educational purposes (or whatever terms you decide on). It's a cold, black and white distillation of your vision for your daughter's future. One she may not fully understand or appreciate.</p><p> I recently interviewed philanthropic advisor training expert and the Sallie B. and William B. Wallace Chair in Philanthropy at The American College, Philip Cubeta. \"There is a movement discussing what people are trying to accomplish with their life and money that's definitely a trend in wealth planning circles&mdash;higher levels of it,\" Mr. Cubeta said.</p><p> People are craving meaning. Mr. Cubeta, however, went on to say that most financial advisors or estate planners simply are not specialized in handling both the philosophical and financial components of creating a holistic estate plan. \"Very few people who went into wealth planning have an anthropology / philosophy background,\" he said.</p><p> <strong>  Cubeta brought up the word LOVE and how that is the core of estate planning and philanthropy. </strong> Yet, he said, \"It's just really awkward using a word like that on business time.... So, you retreat into all this jargon about passing on your for capitals.\"</p><h3> How Do You Address The Emotional Components of Your Estate Plan?</h3><p> <br/> To properly address the emotional and philosophical components of your estate plan, you must first consider your legacy vision. For some, simply adding a well-written legacy letter that explains your principles, viewpoints and feelings is enough. For others, something more elaborate makes sense. Such as creating a family mission statement and constitution, writing a memoir about your life, or designing a family brain trust.</p><p> These \"soft\" components are the heart and soul of your legacy. Your hard assets, the ones most estate planners deal with, are the physical shell. Both are important, but, certainly, your hard assets are much easier to plop into a trust and pass on to the right person. The softer assets are rarely talked about because most financial and estate planners simply don't specialize in it.</p><p> So, the next time you visit an estate planner, realize you are only half done. <strong>  If your love, kindness, and passion isn't recorded somewhere, what you'll end up with is a technically sound, tax-advantaged structure devoid of the care that motivated its creation. </strong></p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 18:37:33.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 18:37:33.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_4ArAZDE.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/love-estate-plannings-four-letter-word/\", \"post_id\": \"9611\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 18:37:33\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 18:37:33\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"love-estate-plannings-four-letter-word\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9610\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4610\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LOVE-Estate-Plannings-Four-letter-Word.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"564\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457159400,"author_id":294,"chart_url":""}

It&rsquo;s almost like a different language.</p><p> Although there are entire books written on the topic, we want to share four tips that you can adopt immediately.</p><h3> 1. No long mission statements on your homepage <br/>  </h3><p> When visitors first visit your page, they&rsquo;re probably not looking for your corporate history, founding principles or executive bios. Instead, they&rsquo;re probably looking for a specific piece of information, whether is about a product or service. So, keep your homepage simple, with links, short descriptions and calls to action.</p><h3> 2. If you want, you can ignore that old &ldquo;three click&rdquo; rule <br/>  </h3><p> There was a time when people thought every bit of information had to be three clicks or less away. Better web frameworks (and writing and design) have made that rule a thing of the past.</p><p> People are willing to click much more than three times to find the info they want. What they need are clear pathways to that info. As long as they can find what they want, they will have a great user experience.</p><h3> 3. Create more lists <br/>  </h3><p> Break up walls of copy. These days, people just skip over them. So if you have important information deep within a large paragraph, you can assume that it may not be read. Bullets, on the other hand, draw your reader&rsquo;s attention and look good on screen.</p><h3> 4. Be gender neutral <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s no need to write &ldquo;either he or she can,&rdquo; &ldquo;he or she will benefit from&rdquo; or a derivative of the he/she structure again. Wherever possible, just use &ldquo;you.&rdquo; Not only do you speak directly to your audience when you write &ldquo;you,&rdquo; you also guarantee that your copy is gender neutral.</p><p> Do you have any more web writing tips?

{"original_id":4443,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Score a New Job? Here's How to Manage Others With More Experience","link":"score-a-new-job-heres-how-to-manage-others-with-more-experience","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> \"I&rsquo;m a new manager. What&rsquo;s your advice for managing people with more experience than I have?\" <br/>  </h3><p> New managers tend to ask this question a lot. Unfortunately, there's no rule book out there with instructions for how to manage, motivate and mentor staff members with more years of experience than you have. I witness a lot of younger managers struggling in this situation and inevitably facing performance and engagement problems as a result.</p><p> As leaders we all want our employees to like us. But we also want to be respected. Unfortunately, many new managers are unable to strike the right balance, especially with employees who are significantly older and more experienced than they are. The natural order of things, in this case, seems at odds with the organizational structure.</p><p> An effective manager needs to build an environment that maximizes employee motivation and engagement. We all know this. Every manager wants to build a positive work environment for people to thrive in. But this is easier said than done. And the challenge is even more difficult when it comes to managing employees who are older than you since there can be an undercurrent of stress built naturally into the relationship.</p><p> As I think back to my early management roles, I faced this situation more than a few times. Here are some of the questions that ran through my mind at the time:</p><li> How do I offer the right level of autonomy while still providing structure?</li><li> How can I motivate a staff member who is older than me without being patronizing?</li><li> How do I deliver feedback when I haven&rsquo;t been doing this for as long as they have?</li><li> How do I strike the right balance between deference and direction? <br/>  </li><h3> Here are some tips for managing people who have more experience than you: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Take competitiveness off the table: </strong></p><p> There is a natural tendency when you&rsquo;re managing someone older than you, for a competitive vibe to manifest. In my experience that competitiveness can come from either party. As the younger manager we often feel some need to prove that we deserve our station. This can come out all wrong if we&rsquo;re not careful. Similarly, as the older employee, we often feel the need to over-assert ourselves to make sure our value and experience isn&rsquo;t forgotten. If left unchecked, that can spiral into subversive or insubordinate behavior.</p><p> My recommendation to younger managers is to make a point of being the senior employee&rsquo;s biggest supporter. You need to go out of your way to make sure the staff member knows that you&rsquo;re on their side &ndash; that you&rsquo;re personally invested in their success. Only when an employee genuinely believes you&rsquo;re a partner in their success will the competitiveness subside.</p><p> <strong>  Let numbers be the judge: </strong></p><p> In this type of relationship it&rsquo;s especially important to provide a clear and measurable mechanism for evaluating performance. Even the slightest whisper of emotional bias or subjective judgment can send the relationship in the wrong direction.</p><p> My recommendation is to build a scorecard for performance that makes it crystal clear how the employee is performing to the point where there can be no debate as to how things are going. Once both the manager and employee are comfortable with the fairness and objectivity in the measurement system, the relationship will become less strained.</p><p> <strong>  Be deferential in front of the team: </strong></p><p> When I manage people with more years of experience than I have, I try to make a point of showing deference for their expertise in front of the team. I&rsquo;m not talking about putting on an act either &ndash; you should never be disingenuous. I&rsquo;m suggesting you go out of your way to communicate the respect you have for the person&rsquo;s experience so they always feel valued. It goes without saying you should be treating all staff members with respect but I think it helps to go the extra mile with more experienced and older members of the team.</p><p> As a manager, this type of public demonstration costs you nothing and it can make a big difference in breaking down barriers and building a cooperative relationship between you and your senior staff members.</p><p> <strong>  Strike a mutual mentorship bargain: </strong></p><p> One of the most important things you can offer as a manager &ndash; to any employee - is the opportunity to learn and develop. But all too often, coaching in the manager-employee relationship flows in only one direction. And in the case where you&rsquo;re managing someone more experienced than you, the mentoring relationship &ndash; in either direction &ndash; can evaporate entirely.</p><p> In my experience, setting up a bi-directional mentoring agreement can be effective and fulfilling. Especially in relationships with more senior staff members. Rather than presume to be the one to do all the teaching, I like to set up regular sessions to share best practices and experiences, and provide value to each other. This type of mutual mentoring program can have a positive impact on your relationship with the more experienced staff member and can also accelerate your own learning and development.</p><p> Managing people is tough. And managing people with more experience that we have is even tougher. To navigate this scenario it&rsquo;s important to stay focused on the most important things you can offer as a leader &ndash; purpose, autonomy, fairness, and the opportunity to learn. To make your relationships with older employees work &ndash; double down on these core principles.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 20:26:30.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 20:26:30.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_Ky9DKkY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/score-a-new-job-heres-how-to-manage-others-with-more-experience/\", \"post_id\": \"9615\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 20:26:30\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 20:26:30\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"score-a-new-job-heres-how-to-manage-others-with-more-experience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9614\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4612\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Good-leader-how-to-manage-others-with-more-experience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1345\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457093700,"author_id":74,"chart_url":""}

They&rsquo;ll measure pipeline data, conversion rates, win rates, call-to-close ratios and other such metrics.</p><p> Like it or not, measurement is the easy part.</p><p> The hard part is this: once you understand where performance is lagging behind, you need to take corrective measures in order to ensure improvement.</p><h3> Where to start? <br/>  </h3><p> After all, there&rsquo;s a whole host of measures you could potentially rely on in order to improve sales team performance. Should we invest in some sales training? Make changes to our CRM or sales force automation systems? Bring in a consultant to help redesign our sales process? Or call in a motivational speaker ?</p><p> In our latest study on the Top-Performing Sales Organisation, we found that one of the main drivers of sales team performance is how effective the sales manager or leader of that specific team is in coaching, motivating and inspiring the team and its members.</p><p> The most important lever in building sales team performance is not improving the skillset of each individual on that team &ndash; it&rsquo;s improving the mindset and skillset of the team manager.</p><p> Unfortunately, many sellers feel their managers fall severely short of the mark. According to the research, a mere 31% of all sellers in most organizations feel their sales manager has the necessary skills to effectively manage and coach them.</p><p> Before you are thinking I&rsquo;m picking on the sales manager here, let me just say this: this is in no way their fault. Most sales managers are hard-working, well-meaning individuals who truly wants their sales team to excel.</p><p> Here lies the rub: they&rsquo;ve never been taught how.</p><p> This means most of them have to build the plane as they are flying it, or rely on generic leadership development and training programs.</p><p> But we have to start somewhere. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s look at some of the more common mistakes that I see sales leaders and managers make when it comes to building and increasing sales team performance.</p><h3> Increasing sales team performance starts with putting in place the right foundation <br/>  </h3><p> If you truly want to increase sales team performance, you need to know first where you&rsquo;re starting from.</p><p> What I mean by that is not looking at your current numbers and take things from there.</p><p> Unfortunately, that only tells you part of the story. Like the speedometer on a car, it only tells you how fast the car is going, not how to make it run better.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s not as simple as telling your team from now on, I want you to have five new prospect meetings per week. If it were only so simple, every sales team I know would be hitting targets effortlessly &ndash; which they&rsquo;re not.</p><p> Put in place a solid foundation for increasing sales team performance takes a much more individualistic, grassroots approach. It starts with understanding the members of your sales team. Their strengths and weaknesses. Their particular sales style. Their hidden beliefs and mental hangups. How they sell, and where they excel.</p><p> The only way to truly get to that level, is to do a thorough assessment of each individual team member. I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with Selleration when they say sales assessments are the most efficient way to gather actionable data about the sales skills, selling competency, sales work ethic and even intellectual abilities.</p><p> Assessments give sales management line of sight into the individual capabilities of each rep, so sales coaching can be tailored to that reps strengths and weaknesses.&rdquo;</p><p> Assessing your people should the first step in laying the foundation to accurately assess and improve sales team performance. But that&rsquo;s just getting you started.</p><h3> A sales team is only as good as its manager <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard the old saying, people leave managers, not companies.

It&rsquo;s crazy-busy here. Always.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Oh I hear ya! This is the first time I&rsquo;ve come up for air in weeks!&rdquo; I replied, feeling like I had to somehow justify the unfilled gap in my day.</p><p> As a culture we wear our overwhelm like a badge of honor, leaving remnants of our busy lives littered in our brief email replies and social media posts, like breadcrumbs, leading us back to&hellip; to what? Ourselves? I think not.</p><p> This &ldquo;busyness&rdquo; thing has been a topic of discussion at my house for the past few years, as I&rsquo;ve noticed a surge in weary-looking friends and participants who are burned-out to the core, yet continue to send emails at 11:30 pm (to which I, admittedly, feel weirdly compelled to reply).  </p><p> When my husband referred me to an recent article examining the busy-epidemic in our culture, I found at least 20 other posts talking about the same thing on the same day.</p><p> The New York Times, Inc., Forbes, HBR, Huffington Post, Fast Company and a dozen &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; on Linkedin and bloggers agree, as a culture we have hit the height of busyness and it&rsquo;s not pretty. </p><p> To sum them all up: &ldquo;Look at how busy we all are! Look at how much we all hate it! Look at how bad it is for us! But look at how we keep on doing it anyway!&rdquo;</p><p> Ironically, at the same time, the market is flooded with hard evidence of the physiological and psychological price we pay for stress.  </p><p> While scanning the daily posts about &ldquo;mindfulness&rdquo; we nod in agreement, armed with good intention and continue to forge ahead as usual thinking we&rsquo;re somehow impervious. That we can take care of ourselves &ldquo;later&rdquo; &ndash; assuming that our health, our family and the relationships that make our businesses (and lives) work, can wait.</p><h3> We all know the culture of busyness is problem and yet who amongst us will have the courage to do something about it? <br/>  </h3><p> Even as I type this I can feel my anxiety mounting. Oh good. It&rsquo;s not enough to feel like I&rsquo;m carrying the world on my shoulders, trying desperately to balance it all (yet knowing full-well that I&rsquo;ll never get everything done). Now I get to reprimand myself for my overly-busy-tendencies! Do we really need another reason to beat ourselves up?</p><p> The thing is, no matter how good our intentions, no matter how hard we try to manage our schedules, I&rsquo;m not confident that this something that we can take-on alone and win, as the cultural-tides of busyness are too strong. Even swimming our hardest we&rsquo;re bound to be pulled under, dragged back out into the sea of overwhelm. We tread water with the rest of the world, hoping to be saved but waiting to drown.</p><p> It seems to me that summer camps have the right idea. No respectable summer camp would allow a kid to venture into the water alone, they always have a buddy. Buddies look out for each other. Buddies can get help if one of them is in trouble. Buddies make sure that both make it to shore safely.</p><h3> Why we all need a buddy - or two <br/>  </h3><p> Buddies look out for each other. Buddies can get help if one of them is in trouble. Buddies make sure that both make it to shore safely. I think we all need a buddy. Or two.</p><p> Someone to remind us that we don&rsquo;t have to do it all. Someone to tear us away from our email to have a real life conversation (that&rsquo;s not in a meeting).  Someone to reinforce that eating a meal during the day (especially one that&rsquo;s not consumed in front of a computer) is a good thing.  Someone to help us set and maintain our own boundaries. Someone who reminds us to delegate. Someone who cares less about the glorification of being busy, and more about the glorification of being our best and making an impact.</p><p> Which can&rsquo;t happen if we&rsquo;re so tapped out that we have nothing great to give.</p><p> The being-busy-cycle leaves us so tapped out that we have nothing great to give.  </p><p> So today, I encourage you to identify your anti-busy-buddies. Who will cheer on your commitment to exercise, or to make it home in time to tuck your kids into bed at night, or refuse to let you text during lunch, or suggest that you give yourself a much needed break to recharge?  Who cares enough about you to not buy your excuses and to support you to find ahealthy way to get what you need-to-get-done done?</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t have someone in your life that will do this, maybe it&rsquo;s time to find them.</p><p> Because one day you may wake up to find that the unhealthy way of doing things has taken a bigger toll than you expected. And nobody&rsquo;s buddy wants to see that happen.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 23:04:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 23:04:54.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_u7wZxUx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/culture-of-busyness-do-you-have-courage-to-do-something-about-it/\", \"post_id\": \"9618\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 23:04:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 23:04:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"culture-of-busyness-do-you-have-courage-to-do-something-about-it\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9616\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4614\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Common-mistakes-to-advoid-as-a-manager-and-leader_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"527\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457113500,"author_id":281,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4446,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Does 'Legendary' Customer Service Feel Like?","link":"what-does-legendary-customer-service-feel-like","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Is your customer experience legendary? Do companies even know what it means to deliver \"legendary customer service?\" <br/>  </h3><p> I've been dealing with a provider for the past three-and-a half-months that claims to deliver \"legendary customer service.\" They tout this on their website, in their emails and even on their voicemails. The problem is, their service is not legendary - at least not in the (positive) way I'm sure they want it to be.  <br/> <br/> I'm meeting with this provider again this week, and in preparation, I thought I'd take a look at what it means to deliver legendary service. Perhaps I just don't understand what they're striving to deliver. <br/> <br/> I'll start with defining \"legendary.\" <br/> <br/> Google defines legendary as based on legends and remarkable enough to be famous; very well known.</p><p> Again, my guess is they want to be \"very well known\" for their levels of service, but known for it in a good way. <br/> <br/> Since legendary is based on legends, I should understand that term, too. </p><p> Wikipedia defines legend as a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and to possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude.</p><p> Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \"possibility\" but which may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep it fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. <br/> <br/> Synonyms are \"myth\" and \"fairy tale.\"  <br/> <br/> I'm still waiting for the miracles. And that \"never being entirely believed\" part is what I'm wondering about. Perhaps their legendary service is just a fairy tale. <br/> <br/> I went on a Google hunt to see how people/companies define \"legendary customer service\" or \"legendary customer experience.\" I found that not many brands tout this; I supposed it's a pretty extreme thing to say or to claim. And those that did, well, they were really describing what I call \"the basics.\" <br/> <br/> Perhaps claiming that you've got legendary service is a bit pointless. <br/> <br/> Sam Walton said: \"The goal as a company is to have customer service that is not just the best but legendary. Do you feel like you get legendary customer service when you go to WalMart? Is it legendary in a good way or a bad way?\" <br/> <br/> The companies that deliver that extraordinary level of service don't have to tell customers in their voicemails and emails, quite honestly; they just do it! We know they do it. Think: Zappos, USAA, The Ritz-Carlton, Southwest, Nordstrom, et al. <br/> <br/> Want to talk about customer experience legends? Google \"Nordstrom returns tires.\"  <br/> <br/> Some of the brands that mentioned legendary service defined it as making sure they met and exceeded the expectations of their customers. (Without a doubt, key to that is understanding what customers' expectations are. Exceeding expectations cannot occur without understanding expectations first.)</p><p> But is that legendary, or is that, too, \"just the basics?\" Saying you're going to meet and exceed expectations is quite generic. As a customer, what does that mean to me? And how do you, as a company, know that you've exceeded my expectations. <br/> <br/> At the very least, I would hope that all businesses strive to meet their customers' expectations. Remember, Performance - Expectations = Satisfaction. Your performance must be greater than those expectations in order to be positively reflected in that equation! <br/> <br/> So if you're going to tout legendary service, well then, by George, you better have something special!  <br/> <br/> Legendary service means going the extra mile, but you can't go the extra mile until you get the last mile right. Delivering on the last mile is all about giving your customers what they expected. The extra mile is that piece that really adds the component of delight.   <br/> <br/> What most organizations think is legendary is really (barely) the basics; they're just striving to get to/through the last mile. The extra mile, or that legendary service, is a pipe dream for them.</p><h3> Let's look at the basics first; they include things like... <br/>  </h3><li> Treating customers with respect</li><li> Acting with integrity</li><li> Being polite - definitely not rude!</li><li> Trusting your customers - don't call them liars!</li><li> Being responsive - set an SLA for response time that shows you care! And stick to it!</li><li> Doing what's right for the customer - you and your organization know what that means; and if you don't, ask your customers</li><li> Doing right by the customer - again, you and your organization know what that means; if not, then ask</li><li> Showing empathy and understanding for the customer's situation</li><li> Walk in the customer's shoes; don't make him walk in yours (e.g., \"Oh, that's easy for me; I can do that. Why can't you?\"</li><li> Putting the customer's best interests before your own</li><li> Caring about your customers (we can tell when you don't) </li><li> Being willing to help your customers</li><li> Adopting an attitude of \"yes\"</li><li> Doing what you say you'll do</li><li> Understanding your customers - the person, the situation, their expectations, and more!</li><li> Making it effortless for customers to do business with you</li><li> Meeting my expectations</li><p> Honestly, this is just meeting today's customer expectations. <br/> <br/> And yet, the provider I'm meeting with fails on all of these. All of them.  <br/> <br/> If those are the basics, then figure out how you can go above and beyond. Every service situation differs. Know your customers. Figure it out. Find out how you can go above and beyond in a way that is meaningful and relevant to the customer in front of you. <br/> <br/> It takes a lot to deliver a legendary level of service.</p><h3> Here's what I think legendary customer service includes: <br/>  </h3><li> All of the items/basics listed above, plus...</li><li> Identifying/understanding my expectations - and exceeding them </li><li> Doing the unexpected, and </li><li> Adding elements of delight that I would appreciate </li><li> Being proactive - why should the customer wait for you? and wait, and wait, and...</li><li> Personalizing it - make it for me and about me, no one else</li><li> Being remarkable - at all you do, in every interaction</li><li> Being consistent - from interaction to interaction, from employee to employee</li><p> What would you add to this list?  <br/> <br/> Just because you say you deliver legendary service doesn't make it real. Just because you tell customers that's what you deliver doesn't make it real. As a matter of fact, once you say it, you better darn well deliver on it. And remember, actions speak louder than words. <br/> <br/> Perhaps this particular provider that I'm dealing with does deliver on it for other customers, but I'd like to reiterate this: legendary service is not selective; legendary service is consistent. You need to uphold the same high standards for every interaction, by every employee. And if you have an employee that can't deliver, perhaps he's not a good fit and needs to go!</p><h3> That's a great segue into what this means for the inner workings of your organization. In a nutshell, there must be: <br/>  </h3><li> a culture of service</li><li> a customer-centric, customer-focused culture</li><li> customers, not metrics or profits, are at the heart of all you do</li><li> leadership to drive, facilitate, and support that culture</li><li> the right employees to not only fit with this culture but also to deliver on its expectations</li><li> a set of core values or guiding principles that employees can call upon should they ever question what to do</li><p> Is your company's culture and customer experience the stuff that legends are made of?  <br/> <br/> I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. - Maya Angelou</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-03 23:15:04.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-03 23:15:04.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_RDMEUyy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-does-legendary-customer-service-feel-like/\", \"post_id\": \"9620\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-03 23:15:04\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-03 23:15:04\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-does-legendary-customer-service-feel-like\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9619\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4615\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Have-you-ever-had-legendary-customer-service.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2960\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457110800,"author_id":42,"chart_url":""}

Immobilized. They lack focus and clarity. They can't get out of their own way. Yet, despite feeling stuck, they equally feel like they are spinning out of control. Their frustration is often tied up feeling anxious and overwhelmed. All of these factors prevent them from taking the necessary steps to create any kind of change so they can start to feel 'unstuck.'</p><p> Stuck in the past and unable to make changes in the present, leads to difficulty creating a different future - a future more aligned to where they want to be. Why? Have you ever heard the cliche, 'if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail?' Or, 'square peg, round hole. No doubt you have. One tool in the toolbox. One strategy. Few, if any options. Because we are creatures of habit (sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes not so much), people are naturally inclined to use the same technique to solve their problems. That works, until well, it doesn't. And all of those factors create more indecision and frustration.</p><p> Unfortunately, in times of distress and uncertainty, people are problem-focused rather than solution-focused. However, changing your mindset from the former to the latter, will provide the springboard you need to solve what ails you.</p><h3> Trust me, it works. <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. First, get out of your own way and be open to changing your mindset from problem focused to solution focused. <br/>  </h3><h3> 2. Visualization.</h3><p> Take time to actually visualize how you would want this situation to look like if you could make it happen. We all dream about what that would look like - more often than you probably realize. Ask yourself: What would it look like? What would you be doing differently? What would remain the same? What would be the solution to this problem in your ideal world? What's Plan B? What has worked in the past? What hasn't? How do I want my relationship/work/life/future - whatever it is, to really look like? Is the resolution to this issue even possible?</p><h3> 3. Goals.</h3><p> Once you have created that image in your mind, set both short and long terms goals to make that happen. What can you do today? This week? This month? What is actually attainable in the short term? Setting and achieving short term goals, increases our self-efficacy, strengthens our abilities, and empowers us to continue to work hard with equal amounts of determination and fortitude.</p><h3> 4. Honor your strengths.</h3><p> We all have them. Ask: What are your strengths in solving this problem? What is your weakest link? What resources do you need to get to address your weakest links? Is this issue similar to another issue you have struggled with in the past?

Therefore, peaks and valleys are normal when studying leadership. When learning leadership becomes difficult, when it dips into one of its inevitable valleys, a key tool for climbing out of that valley is reflection. In a leadership development experience you are learning the art of taking action in a complex system. How can self-reflection reveal what needs to be done in organizational change as the work of leadership?</p><h3> Self-reflection creates revelation by providing access to more data.</h3><p> <br/> Picture this: you are involved in an incident in which you thought you did nothing wrong or inappropriate. Upon further reflection you realized that you had caused discomfort or inconvenience for another person. Gradually, you felt some remorse or guilt over your own conduct, and decided to apologize. Perhaps you wrote a formal letter of apology, or picked up the phone and called the other person. Reality now looked different and a new set of opportunities opened up for you. The same function occurs in organizational change.</p><p> <strong>  We have busy lives. </strong> We don't always take time to reflect on what we are doing. We go from one task to the next without pausing to consider what is truly important. Momentum can help us move forward with an important new task, such as an exercise program or a project. However, forward momentum that is not tempered by contemplation can blind us to meaningful questions about our choices, our conduct, and the use of our time.</p><li> <strong>  What is the impact of what I'm doing on the world around me? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Is this where I really want to go or am I just getting there by automatic pilot? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Why should I accomplish a task one way and not another? </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> These types of questions require self-reflection.</h3><p> <br/> Self-reflection allows us to pause and consider what we have done and where we are headed.</p><p> I often refer to a concept I call &ldquo;showing up.&rdquo; If you show up in life only to \"look good\" or to \"win\" you are not going to learn, or grow, or lead. Because, inevitably, learning will happen through stumbling, getting outside of your comfort zone, perhaps even looking bad. You need to choose whether or not you are going to show up looking to succeed but ready to stumble or fail. We are surrounded by a society that continuously reminds us not to take risks. Risks are bad, risks are dangerous: save your money for an emergency; get an extended warranty on your purchase; don't drive in bad weather. And make sure you have insurance - on your car, your home, your flight, your health&hellip;on your life&hellip;</p><p> The way to deal with those situations requires a little bit more daring than merely playing it safe. It is true that sometimes playing it safe is a good idea: seat belts, safe sex, bicycle helmets and backing up your hard drive all seem like good ideas. The problem is that when security dominates our lives it leaves no room for the unknown.</p><h3> Learning is about change, and change is about venturing in open waters by taking risks.</h3><p> <br/> Imagine the new you or the new organization you want to create. I am sure you can envision your own process of change as the outcome of being clear in your purpose and taking time to reflect on the context and then take actions that involve risk in that context.</p><p> If you want to have an impact in this work stop trying to &ldquo;look good&rdquo; and make &ldquo;reflection,&rdquo; &ldquo;risk,&rdquo; and &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; your key words.</p><p> Reflection + Risk + Purpose = Learning, which leads to meaningful change. True transformational learning, as opposed to the &ldquo;window-dressing&rdquo; kind of learning, is what leads to innovation.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-04 16:13:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-04 16:13:38.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_wC3Ecai.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/daring-to-reflect-to-multiply-your-impact-as-a-leader/\", \"post_id\": \"9624\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-04 16:13:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-04 16:13:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"daring-to-reflect-to-multiply-your-impact-as-a-leader\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9623\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4617\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Daring-to-Reflect-to-Multiply-Your-Impact-as-a-Leader.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"839\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457373600,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

We typically hold a kick-off workshop with our global insurance network with anywhere from 8 to 12 countries represented.  We recap and evaluate how well the previous year&rsquo;s Report resonated with the industry and we brainstorm what topic we think would be most relevant for our clients. <strong>  This past summer, we had a lively discussion around the topic of Internet of Things (IoT) and our hypotheses around how we see this impacting insurers . . . and more importantly . . . WHEN will it start to impact them. </strong>   While we had some differences in opinion, we agreed to focus our research on this whole concept of connected ecosystems, embedded technology and machine intelligence.We developed our hypotheses and set off to roll out our global voice of the customer survey in 30 countries and to start scheduling CxO interviews across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.  I had the opportunity to run a number of the interviews and each interview was eye opening &ndash; both in terms of how advanced some firms' planning had evolved, as well as how little mindshare others had given to the topic.</p><h3> Technological advances, driven by IoT, are shaping customer lives and will have a profound impact on the insurance industry</h3>Our first hypothesis was that three technological advances, all tied to Internet of Things, are shaping customer lives:<li> <strong>  Connected Ecosystems:  </strong> The digital world is moving towards an advanced stage of interconnectivity, where devices form a self-managed, independent ecosystem through machine-to-machine communication.</li><li> <strong>  Embedded Technology:  </strong> As electronic devices become smaller in size and more portable, they are gradually integrating into human lives through wearables and disappearables that can fit into the human body, as well as devices that can be embedded into other devices and products.</li><li> <strong>  Machine Intelligence: </strong>  The third emerging theme in technology is that of machine intelligence where machines are increasingly being equipped to perform human tasks and take intelligent decisions.</li>Under these themes, three technologies that are especially important and impactful for the insurance industry are: Smart Ecosystems (such as smart homes and smart buildings), Wearables, and Driverless Cars.<h3> Likelihood of customer adoption is high, with affluence being the strongest correlation to adoption</h3>Globally, customers have shown similar interests in Smart Ecosystems and Wearables, with approximately one-third noting their likelihood to adopt these technologies.  And while certainly a lower level, nearly one-quarter of customers noted their likelihood to adopt Driverless Cars.Not surprising, Gen Y did note a higher interest in adopting these technologies.  However, an interesting finding that emerged was that affluence was a more significant factor than age in determining customer uptake of the new technologies. Globally, more than 45% of affluent Gen X customers rated that they are likely to adopt smart ecosystems and wearables whereas only 30-35% of non-affluent Gen Y customers rated so. Similarly, more than 50% of affluent Gen Y customers rated that they are likely to adopt Smart Ecosystems and Wearables vs. only approximately one-third of the non-affluent Gen Y noted the same.<h3> Most insurers are still in early stages, but are expected to move fast</h3>Insurers clearly noted the current maturity level of their offerings tied to these connected technologies to be very low.  However, across the board, they expect to their offerings related to Wearables and Smart Ecosystems to reach full maturity within five years.  This suggest that these technologies are not only relevant, but that investments are already being made to address the demand.Insurers noted the greatest interest in being first movers (36.9%) in developing offerings related to Smart Ecosystems.  A slightly lower percentage (29.9%) were planning on being first movers in the case of Wearables.  However, an even larger percentage (32.9%) were ready to wait until they saw successful case studies on use of Wearables from other insurers.With Driverless Cars, insurers are following a more cautious approach. Their planned maturity level for offerings related to Driverless Cars is lower than that for Smart Ecosystems and Wearables. Also, a greater proportion of insurers wish to follow a wait-and-watch approach when it comes to making investments in this technologyAfter interviews with over 180 insurance executives and survey data from over 15,500 insurance customers, it is clear our initial hypotheses had some legs.  Customers across all demographics (although especially the affluent and Gen Y) have noted a high affinity to adopt new technology related to the Internet of Things.It is also clear the adoption of this technology is going to provide a significant opportunity for insurers.  However, existing maturity levels are very low across the board and represent a big threat if they fail to get moving quickly.  If insurers are to believed that they will have fully mature offerings related to Smart Ecosystems and Wearables within five years, they must start planning their investments and building their capabilities yesterday.<strong> More to come next week as I dive deeper into some of our findings around Smart Ecosystems and Wearables.</strong>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-04 16:19:44.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-04 16:19:44.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_cegKAyQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/insurers-still-in-nascent-stage-of-adapting-to-an-increasingly-connected-world-wir16/\", \"post_id\": \"9626\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-04 16:19:44\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-04 16:19:44\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"insurers-still-in-nascent-stage-of-adapting-to-an-increasingly-connected-world-wir16\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9625\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4618\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Insurers-Still-in-Nascent-Stage-of-Adapting-to-an-Increasingly-Connected-World.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1037\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457359200,"author_id":63,"chart_url":""}

You know on any given day you&rsquo;re able to figure it out. But today, just for today, your brain is going on strike. Can&rsquo;t process another piece of information. Can&rsquo;t look at one more spread-sheet. Can&rsquo;t listen to one more scintillating idea.</p><h3> Mental fatigue. Shut-down. Brain-dead.</h3><p> <br/> In an article titled &ldquo;The Science of Fitness,&rdquo; Gretchen Reynolds distills some compelling research on the mechanics of mental fatigue (New York Times Health and Wellness Section, 10/02/13). Common wisdom has it that bouts of short exercise improve cognition. Long, strenuous exercise will temporarily inhibit cognition &ndash; it simply leaves us too tired to think. But recent research, conducted by the University of Kent in conjunction with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, clearly shows that mental fatigue, in turn, impairs our body&rsquo;s ability to function.</p><h3> Yes, the brain-body correlation is powerful. And it&rsquo;s synchronous. Whew.</h3><p> <br/> The implications for our everyday work habits are tremendous. When our brain is tired of thinking, we need to stop thinking. Otherwise our body will start to shut down. And suddenly we&rsquo;re in double-shut-down-mode.</p><p> How do we stop thinking? How do we re-fuel a fatigued brain? Not that easy in an over-stuffed work day, is it? Consider the following mental-fatigue-busters:</p><li> <strong>  3-minute mental break: </strong>  Shut your eyes. Put on your noise-canceling head-phones. Listen to your favorite mood-mellowing-music. And set a timer so your brain isn&rsquo;t obsessing about how much time you have left before you go back on task.</li><li> <strong>  3-minute fitness break:  </strong> Jog in place. Free-flow dance. You decide what kind of movement you do. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be strenuous. But move, really truly move for an entire 3 minutes. Activate your body.</li><li> <strong>  3-minute refueling-break: </strong>  Make a smoothie. Pour a bowl of cereal and milk. Venture beyond merely un-wrapping an energy bar and feeding yourself while you continue to work. Your devotion to the act of actually fixing a snack is a key part of the mental refueling.</li><li> <strong>  3-minute do-nothing-break: </strong>  Doing nothing is alpha-hell. But commit to it anyway. 3 minutes in which you don&rsquo;t check emails. You don&rsquo;t text or tweet. You don&rsquo;t make a phone call. You don&rsquo;t check your voice-mail. 3 minutes in which you do not engage in any purpose-driven behavior of any sort. <br/>  </li><p> My colleague and friend Walt Hampton stresses the importance of going OFF-grid at regular intervals. If your work consists of relentless mental activity, day in, day out, venture beyond our 3-minute breaks. Consider OFF-gridding for 3 days, every 3 months. Make these 3 days part of your life rhythm. It means going OFF-technology, OFF-social obligations, OFF-finding things to keep busy. It means foregoing the casino and lounging in the hammock, avoiding the mall and embracing the spa. It means resolutely going OFF.</p><h3> Your mind and your body will enter nirvana.

{"original_id":4451,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Women Investors: What Sets Them Apart From Men","link":"women-investors-what-sets-them-apart-from-men","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The key to winning with women is understanding the differences between men and women, uncovering the opportunities and building a relationship.</h3><p> <br/> While there are many similarities between how men and women invest, there are important differences.</p><h3> The differences</h3><p> <br/> Generally men tend to compartmentalize investing as an activity separate from their lives. Women, on the other hand, see investing in terms of their whole lives and not an isolated activity. For women, money is not so much a measure of their &ldquo;selfworth&rdquo; or &ldquo;success&rdquo; but it is about &ldquo;choice.&rdquo;</p><p> Another difference is that women downplay their knowledge about investing, unlike men, who more often than not overestimate their level of understanding. A financial advisor who is paying attention needs to point out that she probably knows far more about investing than she realizes. They may not even realize the implications of their knowledge but when Lululemon&rsquo;s founder offended women saying some shouldn&rsquo;t wear their yoga pants, many of these women boycotted the store sending their stock into a tailspin and when Walmart voluntarily raised their minimum wage, women recognized it as a &ldquo;good&rdquo; company.</p><h3> The opportunities</h3><p> <br/> The good news for advisors is that women are less opaque than men. If you want to know something, just ask them. They will tell you. But be ready to listen. Don&rsquo;t ask, if you really don&rsquo;t want an answer, and, above all, don&rsquo;t ask if you&rsquo;re not willing to give them what they want.</p><p> Remember, it is up to you, their advisor, to adapt your strategy to their style. If you fulfill their need to understand and make good decisions, without trying to impress them with your knowledge, and you treat them as a partner in the process, they are less likely to question your recommendations or second-guess you and more likely to refer you to their friends.</p><h3> Building a relationship</h3><p> <br/> Women want to establish a relationship with their financial advisor. They want and need advice and appreciate their advisor far beyond the rate of return on their portfolio.</p><p> They establish a relationship by connecting on a human level first: what do you have in common &ndash; skiing, a charitable cause, an elderly parent, or a disabled child. Women also want to know they have a role, an important role, to play in their relationship with you as their financial advisor.

{"original_id":4452,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Finance and Feelings: Navigating Life's Twists and Turns","link":"finance-and-feelings-navigating-lifes-twists-and-turns","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> &ldquo;Take the emotion out of money.&rdquo; At one time or another, you&rsquo;ve probably heard this advice, whether you&rsquo;ve heeded it or not. But is it the best advice?</h3><p> <br/> Last week I was happy to host a presentation and discussion with Dave Jetson, a therapist and financial counselor who would certainly disagree with those words of wisdom. In his work and his writings (his latest book is  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJL8O98/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Finding Emotional Freedom: Access the Truth Your Brain Already Knows  </a> </u> ), Dave focuses on helping individuals explore and heal money issues. Over the course of the evening, Dave shared how our emotions impact our financial decisions, and how three parts of our brains&mdash;our &ldquo;trauma child,&rdquo; conscious brain, and inner child&mdash;all compete for our resources and dictate how we save and how we spend. As a financial advisor, I found Dave&rsquo;s thoughts and research to be in line with my experience observing how feelings can cloud judgment and, all too often, derail the best-laid financial plans.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no mystery that money is an emotional hot topic for almost everyone. Even though we know intellectually that money is simply a necessary tool to support our goals, most of us can&rsquo;t help but have feelings (and often lots of them!) about money. And those feelings, whether they&rsquo;re conscious or not, can cause some very real issues when it comes to making smart decisions.  Issues that typically cause the most conflict are rooted in our fears about money, safety, and survival. Dave refers to this fear as the reaction of the &ldquo;trauma child&rdquo;&mdash;the part of us that, at a very young age, formed our deep-rooted reactions to money. Like Dave, I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s important not to ignore these feelings when they come up, but instead to connect with them and share them&mdash;especially when making decisions together with your partner. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p> <strong>  My clients Julian and Karen have very different perspectives about money. </strong> Julian was raised by a single mother and money was always a challenge, so he has a lot of fear about being able to provide for his family. To manage his fear, he is hyper rational about money. He serves as the financial regulator in the family, setting the budget and the savings rates, and taking full responsibility for meeting their financial goals. His wife Karen, on the other hand, was raised in an affluent family and never had to worry about money. Since Julian takes the reins financially, she doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about survival, so she&rsquo;s free to focus on keeping the family healthy and happy. That structure seemed to work well, until recently when they faced a financial crisis that challenged their thinking. When their pre-teen daughter showed signs of serious depression and needed a residential treatment program, Karen called me in tears. Julian was refusing to spend the money needed to pay for his daughter&rsquo;s treatment, and talking to him about the issue was leading nowhere.</p><p> I was so glad she called. Clearly this crisis was bringing some big emotions into play, and those feelings were clouding the real issues. Whether it was their &ldquo;trauma children&rdquo; interfering or some other issue, I knew I needed to tread carefully. But I also knew that, ultimately, they both wanted the same things: a happy, healthy, financially secure family. With that as a basis, I was able to help. I asked them to meet with me as soon as possible to talk through the issue and see if we could agree on a solution. When we sat down together, I began by asking them to revisit their shared values. Next, we talked about their fears. Julian opened up about his fear of getting off track from their savings plan. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know if this treatment will work, and it will set us back a lot. How can we be sure we have enough money to cover the expense and still be on track for retirement?&rdquo; Karen shared her fears for her daughter. &ldquo;Depression is a serious issue. What is it worth to us to be sure she can recover and be safe and happy?&rdquo; Then she shared about her sister&rsquo;s depression growing up and how much it had scared her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do anything for her, and it made me feel helpless.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  As we talked, I could see the walls come down. </strong> In less than an hour, Julian and Karen had &ldquo;felt&rdquo; their way through the issue instead of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; their way through it. They both had a new appreciation for where the other was coming from and, most importantly, they were re-focused on their shared values and goals. Julian was able to see that this crisis was a small wrinkle in their big-picture plan&mdash;not a derailment&mdash;and Karen was no longer angry at his initial reaction to what she saw as an urgent need.</p><h3> It may sound a lot like a full-fledged psychotherapy session, and while I&rsquo;m certainly not a therapist, financial planning is, by definition, a type of intervention.</h3><p> <br/> The purpose of creating a financial plan is to help identify your values, understand your goals, and create a tangible path to achieving your short- and long-term objectives. But even with a great plan in place, there&rsquo;s always (and I mean always) an unexpected twist and turn. At one time or another, every family will face a crisis that drives them back to that emotional place and forces them to deal with a &ldquo;trauma child&rdquo; throwing a fit that can threaten to undo even the best-laid plans.</p><p> As Dave Jetson shared last Thursday, <strong>  &ldquo;Our &lsquo;trauma brain&rsquo; is the same as our financial brain.&rdquo; </strong> That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to what we&rsquo;re feeling first, and then tackle the dollars and cents of the equation. So the next time you&rsquo;re facing a financial decision that has you feeling less than peaceful, take the time to connect with what you&rsquo;re feeling rather than &ldquo;taking the emotion out of money.&rdquo; I expect you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s a much easier path to wise, rational decisions&mdash;about money and just about everything else.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-04 20:22:45.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-04 20:22:45.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_DXKueCQ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/finance-and-feelings-navigating-lifes-twists-and-turns/\", \"post_id\": \"9632\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-04 20:22:45\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-04 20:22:45\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"finance-and-feelings-navigating-lifes-twists-and-turns\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9631\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4621\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Finance-and-Feelings-Navigating-Lifes-Twists-and-Turns.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"725\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457352900,"author_id":297,"chart_url":""}

Amys will assist in nearly every facet of financial planning except for the actual meeting with clients and managing their behavioral biases.

The main advantage that a robot has over the human is that they fully prepare before a meeting. In a research study, we recently completed, advisors will not emotionally engage 40% of prospective clients. The way that they approach them in their first interactions will be a complete turn off (whether it be too pushy, too salesy, or just a personality mismatch). Robo 2.0 platforms will be able to reduce this mismatch by drawing on data from data.com, behavioral science, and demographic databases to know exactly to whom they are talking, their interests, their personality, their likely needs and key demographics and the ability to change their pitch accordingly.</p><p> In order to be competitive, advisors must emotionally connect to their clients, quicker and more reliably, by better understanding their financial personality and how to provide the type of personalized support each person needs.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-06 18:47:32.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-06 18:47:32.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_bA0kbkL.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/robo-2-0-your-torrid-behavioral-finance-fantasy-comes-true/\", \"post_id\": \"9634\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-06 18:47:32\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-06 18:47:32\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"robo-2-0-your-torrid-behavioral-finance-fantasy-comes-true\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9633\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4622\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robo-2.0-Your-Torrid-Behavioral-Finance-Fantasy-Comes-True.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"841\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457357400,"author_id":199,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4454,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Giving and Happiness: A Complicated Partnership","link":"giving-and-happiness-a-complicated-partnership","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Recently a reader suggested I write about the relationship between giving and happiness, noting that research shows people who give to charity are happier. One such study from Harvard Business School in 2009 is titled &ldquo; <u>  Feeling Good About Giving </u> .&rdquo; It not only found a link between giving and happiness, but highlighted some thought-provoking issues about the ways charities ask for donations.</p><p> Yet the question of whether prosocial spending (i.e., donating to charitable causes) promotes happiness is far from a simple one.</p><h3> Many times, giving is complicated by guilt, shame, and obligation.</h3><p> <br/> I remember attending a luncheon hosted by a local charity to explain a building project it was undertaking. I had never given to this particular organization, but I supported the project. The organizers described it in detail and asked supporters to contribute monthly payments over a five-year period.</p><p> Impressed with the project, I decided to pledge $250 a month. This would add up to what to me was a substantial gift of $15,000. I felt happy about my choice to give this amount to a project I really believed in. If that had been the end of it, everyone would have been happy, but unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Just before we were asked to fill out a card with our pledges, table hosts handed out personalized envelopes to each person. <strong>  These contained suggested contribution amounts. </strong></p><p> I opened the envelope to find my suggested pledge was $1,667. It took me several seconds to realize this wasn&rsquo;t an annual or a five-year total; it was the monthly pledge. I was speechless.</p><h3> My feeling of happiness over what I viewed as a generous contribution immediately vanished.</h3><p> <br/> I was now feeling guilt and shame. I felt that if I were to offer $250 a month when the expectation was $1,667, my gift would not be appreciated and I would also be perceived as stingy and greedy.</p><p> When the time came to make our pledges, I put down &ldquo;$0.&rdquo; What had been a gift freely given had become an obligation, and an insufficient one at that.</p><p> Over the years, I have come to realize that giving, like other forms of spending, can be done for many reasons, some of which we aren&rsquo;t even consciously aware of. To help make more conscious choices about giving to either charities or individuals, you might consider asking yourself the following questions, which are adapted from a checklist in my co-authored book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0027P9PUC/kahlerfinanci-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Conscious Finance  </a> </u> .</p><li> <strong>  If a charity is involved, is it   <u>   <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/healthy-money-relationships/support-your-local-charities-but-verify-first\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    legitimate and well-run   </a>  </u>  ? </strong> (One source for checking is charitynavigator.org.)</li><li> <strong>  How will I feel if I make this gift? </strong> Satisfied? Joyful? Resentful? Taken advantage of?</li><li> <strong>  Will this gift help someone solve a problem or take responsibility for solving the problem away from them? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will this gift encourage the recipient&rsquo;s independence or foster dependence? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Am I giving freely or out of guilt or obligation? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What might be the consequences if I make this gift? </strong> If I don&rsquo;t?</li><li> <strong>  Am I giving out of a genuine desire to help or to get attention and recognition for myself? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Am I feeling pressured or rushed into an answer? </strong> Do I need some time to think before I decide?</li><li> <strong>  Are there other ways I might help instead of giving money? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will this gift foster closeness between the recipient and me or create a barrier between us? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Asking questions like these can help us clarify our motivations around giving and make our decisions more consciously. This makes it more likely that our giving will promote happiness and satisfaction for ourselves. Equally important, it increases the likelihood that our giving will promote happiness and well-being for the recipients.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-06 18:58:05.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-06 18:58:05.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_l82QJHY.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/giving-and-happiness-a-complicated-partnership/\", \"post_id\": \"9636\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-06 18:58:05\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-06 18:58:05\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"giving-and-happiness-a-complicated-partnership\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9635\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4623\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Giving-and-Happiness-A-Complicated-Partnership.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"722\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457377200,"author_id":399,"chart_url":""}

We need to be creating or sourcing, and then delivering, content which helps them:</p><li> <strong>  understand what the issues are which they may be facing </strong></li><li> <strong>  learn how using strategies, products or plans can change their world, and in what ways </strong></li><li> <strong>  shape their thinking about the merits of various strategies or options </strong></li><li> <strong>  identify the value that our firm brings to the issue and options for this type of prospect </strong></li><li> <strong>  self-educate and conduct basic planning with self-assessment tools, calculators, checklists or information </strong></li><li> <strong>  understand where generic information and self-assessment options have limitations </strong></li><li> <strong>  know that we are constantly available to help at any point in the process &ndash; but without being pushy or intrusive </strong> <br/>  </li><p> If we put together such a process and deliver it the target audience, and then continue to draw attention to the fact that we are providing the resources they need, the prospects will be more likely to engage with us via our content.  Providing the content continues to be helpful and a high quality, and consists of material that matches their buying journey, the odds are very good that the consumer will build confidence in our style, expertise and value.   <strong>  That will lead to increased conversions of prospects to clients for the firm which does this well. </strong></p><p> Demonstrate value in advance through content and engagement marketing, and there will be more prospects choosing you.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-06 19:04:37.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-06 19:04:37.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_1QZgHv1.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/demonstrate-your-value-and-prospects-will-choose-you/\", \"post_id\": \"9638\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-06 19:04:37\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-06 19:04:37\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"demonstrate-your-value-and-prospects-will-choose-you\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9637\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4624\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Demonstrate-Your-Value-And-Prospects-Will-Choose-You.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"496\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457370000,"author_id":491,"chart_url":""}

Among the gems I uncovered:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-epN8ttOUs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spud gun with propane and oxygen (&ldquo;dangerous, NOT RECOMMENDED !!!&rdquo;)  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty5XxjxGCl4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the 25 most death-defying stunts ever  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ozy1cFQgs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;we try to pull down a 30 foot tree with a Hunt V and its wench.

The rest? Sheer hopeidity. Which opens deep questions: what motivates people to accept risks? Why do some  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhskvloj1gE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   BASE jump  </a> </u> , or  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE5eqel5-M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   willingly leap from high bridges with a bungee cord strapped to their ankles  </a> </u> ?  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/us/nation-s-deepest-coal-mine-now-ranks-among-deadliest.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Why do men and women descend into coal mines 175 stories deep in the earth  </a> </u>  to earn a paycheck? Why do entrepreneurs invest their entire savings to start companies, when others say, &ldquo;no freaking way!&rdquo;</p><h3> I accept that I will not come close to solving this bafflement.</h3><p> <br/> It joins a collection of other perplexities: how infants transform from joyously happy to shrill meltdown in a mere instant. Why GM ever produced the Pontiac Aztec. But I see a bright side to my willful ignorance. Disparities in risk perception drive capitalist economies, of which I am a part. Ignorance as a patriotic duty? That&rsquo;s a discussion I will take up later. Today, I will not talk politics.</p><p> If every individual had an identical view on risk, commerce would grind to a halt. Financial exchanges and commodities markets would not exist. Money would not be loaned or invested. And that means no farming, no livestock, no food production. Everyone would be forced to subsist on wild mushrooms and berries. Microwave ovens would be cannibalized to provide scrap metal for roofing.</p><p> I offer a simple, though imperfect, explanation for  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hk6y8dhkeE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   why I won&rsquo;t voluntarily don a wingsuit, and sprint from a sheer, rocky cliff  </a> </u> , arms and fingers extended, with experimental clothing and air pressure differential as my only means to support a safe descent: I can&rsquo;t tolerate the risk. And, for sure, I lack capacity to deal with a failed outcome.</p><h3> Risk tolerance is a mushy concept. It&rsquo;s hard to quantify, and difficult to explain.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just say that risk tolerance relates to feelings and attitudes about uncertainty in the context of attaining a goal.&rdquo; Besides, I&rsquo;ve promised to keep this article short, and Sigmund Freud, I&rsquo;m not.</p><p> What I do know is that for wingsuit flying, the possible outcomes are binary. I can either live to talk about a thrilling experience that few others have the viscera to try, or through an unfortunate landing, I can become sustenance for coyotes and vultures. My thoughtful decision: nein! Here, my risk tolerance relegates me to watching someone else fly, while I&rsquo;m solidly plunked in a folding chair, eighty feet from the precipice, cold IPA in hand, faithful hound at my side. I&rsquo;m OK with that. I can still get an adrenaline rush without needing to be asked whether I have updated and signed my will.</p><p> I&rsquo;ll leave risk tolerance to be dissected in touchy-feely psychology journals. <strong>  But risk capacity? &ndash; well, that&rsquo;s quantifiable, and it fits nicely in my wheelhouse. </strong> Give me a number, and straightaway, I&rsquo;ll crunch it into a ratio or performance indicator. In business, I can&rsquo;t easily gauge risk tolerance, but I can certainly calculate whether people or companies have the assets and cash flow to sustain a failed outcome.</p><p> &ldquo;Hey, y&rsquo;all! Watch this!&rdquo; I can spot versions of this bravado from a mile away. For example,  <u>  &ldquo;One year after its inception, IMSWorkX Inc. expects to grow 300 percent in 2014 because of a key personnel addition and recently introduced production.&rdquo; </u>  A feat that requires spunk, and boundless hope. The company&rsquo;s president, Shannon Chevier, added, &ldquo;We started off with a little bit of an installed base, but we&rsquo;ve increased that dramatically this year and we have huge plans for the coming year.&rdquo; In this vicinity, I expected her to mention customer and future demand. But no. I had to settle for installed base. Hopeidity. We need this word.</p><h3> Customers create revenue. So executing huge revenue plans requires more than making tangential references to them.</h3><p> <br/> It also requires financial muscle to cover the risk of failure. Something that can&rsquo;t be assumed, as Richard Harris, CEO of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.addthis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AddThis  </a> </u>  explained at the  <u>  Mid-Atlantic Venture Association&rsquo;s June, 2015 TechBuzz event in Virginia </u> . Harris described a company he worked with which had an operating plan that &ldquo;relied on one big deal&rdquo; closing. Hail, Mary! &ldquo;And what if that doesn&rsquo;t happen?&rdquo; Harris asked the company&rsquo;s senior executive. &ldquo;We run out of cash at the end of the year.&rdquo; At least the executive was honest, and didn&rsquo;t waste time dancing around the answer. The company lost the deal, and suffered a hard landing. High Risk Tolerance with Low Capacity for Failure. This story needs a shorter, less-jargoned title. How about, Hey y&rsquo;all! Watch This!</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/14-biggest-mass-layoff-announcements-2013-6?op=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Massive layoffs  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/belly-up-the-10-largest-bankruptcies-in-2014-336239/7/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bankruptcies  </a> </u> . These are conspicuous artifacts of incongruity between risk tolerance and risk capacity. Yet, companies often ignore the canary in the coal mine: repeated revenue shortfalls. Which underscores why CXO&rsquo;s need to soil their  <u>  A. Testoni shoes </u> , and wade into the sales weeds.</p><p> When I asked a related question on several LinkedIn forums recently (&ldquo;Does your company&rsquo;s CFO provide input, governance, or guidance over sales lead qualification?&rdquo;), I received one lonely response: &ldquo;Please clarify why a CFO would need to provide input, governance, or guidance over sales lead qualification. Do they have any experience in any of those fields?&rdquo;</p><p> Had I substituted the F in CFO for an M, my inbox would have been inundated with adamant opinion and pointed advice. Serendipitously, the solitary answer I received illuminated an important concern: few recognize the connection between financial planning and selling risks.</p><p> In fact, the two are intertwined. In 2010, an in-house blog for  <u>  <a href=\"http://rubiconproject.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Rubicon Project, Inc  </a> </u> . stated that the company &ldquo;generates over $100 million in revenue annually&rdquo; through advertising volume. Beneath the headline MAKING IT RAIN, the company forecast that revenue would &ldquo;grow to $200 million in 2011.&rdquo; But in January, 2014, the company&rsquo;s IPO prospectus &ldquo;showed just $37.1 million in revenue for 2011 and a net loss of $15.4 million,&rdquo; according to The Wall Street Journal ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tech-startups-play-the-numbers-game-1433903883\" target=\"_blank\">   Tech Startups Play Numbers Game  </a> </u> , June 10 2015). The company&rsquo;s revenue &ldquo;surged [in 2014] to $125.3 million, but that was still far below the $200 million number announced by Rubicon in 2010. Rubicon had a net loss of $18.7 million last year.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey y&rsquo;all! Watch This!&rdquo; This revenue estimate collided with a rock.</p><h3> Such disparities create shock and awe.</h3><p> <br/> Rubicon Project missed its revenue goal by 82% &ndash; an epic planning failure. But I&rsquo;m not surprised. Marketing and sales executives hoard many crucial decisions that influence revenue risk: How to qualify leads, which pipeline multiplier to use, how much revenue to sell through channel partners, how to guide social media conversations, which sales process to use, how to develop and train the sales force. When shortfalls hit the fan, CXO&rsquo;s scratch their heads, wondering why so many of their spreadsheet cells are populated with red numbers.</p><p> Decisions about how to achieve profits, market share, revenue growth, customer loyalty, and high shareholder returns are rarely compatible. Nor are personal attitudes about risk, which vary from &ldquo;hey y&rsquo;all watch this!&rdquo; to &ldquo;no freaking way!&rdquo; So companies must establish a risk appetite framework for revenue operations that guides the nature, types, and levels of risk that the organization is willing to assume. That gives decision makers guidance for discriminating between which risks to accept, and which to reject.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal describes a risk appetite framework as &ldquo;a structured approach to governance, management, measurement, monitoring and control of risk.&rdquo;  <a href=\"http://deloitte.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2015/01/05/the-benefits-of-implementing-a-risk-appetite-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">  (  <u>   The Benefits of Implementing a Risk Appetite Framework  </u>  ) </a> . There are three tiers &ndash; risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk limits &ndash; represented as an inverted triangle, with risk capacity at the top and risk limits at the bottom. The inferences are clear: a company&rsquo;s risk appetite should never exceed its capacity to absorb failure. And its self-imposed limits shouldn&rsquo;t exceed its appetite.</p><p> <strong>  According to the article, </strong></p><h3> Risk capacity: </h3><p> <strong>  Management&rsquo;s assessment of the maximum amount of risk </strong> that the firm can assume, given factors such as its capital base, liquidity, borrowing capacity and regulatory standing.</p><h3> Risk appetite:</h3><p> <strong>  The level and type of risk </strong> a firm is able and willing to assume in its exposures and business activities, given its business objectives and obligations to stakeholders.</p><h3> Risk limits:</h3><p> <strong>  Amounts of acceptable risk </strong> &mdash;measures and thresholds&mdash;related to specific risks, or to specific departments or processes.</p><p> Evidence of a company&rsquo;s risk appetite is found in its culture. Some companies instill a culture of knock-kneed fear. They perennially take cautious baby steps with new initiatives, and flagrantly penalize employees for failing. Others have high risk appetite, encouraging employees to try things that have uncertain outcomes. Most are utterly inconsistent. One company I worked for had a policy of putting any salesperson who made less than 85% of goal on a Performance Improvement Plan (read: in three months, you will be fired). Meanwhile, executives in other departments kept their jobs as they speculatively tinkered with products and programs, and squandered millions of dollars.</p><p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://erm.ncsu.edu/az/erm/i/chan/library/338_Corporate_Risk_Canada_Risk_Appetite_2012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Defining Your Appetite for Risk (Corporate Risk Canada  </a> </u> , Spring 2012), Rob Quail provides a low-to-high scale for risk appetite &ndash; averse, minimalist, cautious, flexible, and open. Companies can adopt these levels enterprise-wide, departmentally, or for a specific process. The point is, establish a policy. Don&rsquo;t leave risk acceptance to personal whim.</p><h3> Quail shares four questions for determining appetite: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  What is the organization&rsquo;s overall philosophy toward the achievement of the [revenue] objective? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How much uncertainty or volatility is acceptable? </strong></li><li> <strong>  When faced with choices, how willing is the organization to select something that puts the objective at risk? </strong></li><li> <strong>  How willing is the company to trade off achieving this objective for other objectives? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Richard Barfield of PriceWaterhouseCoopers outlines three measures for risk in an article,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/banking-capital-markets/pdf/risk_appetite.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Risk Appetite &ndash; How Hungry Are You?  </a> </u></p><p> Quantitative measures. Companies must connect business plans to risk measurement processes. For example, &ldquo;appetite for earnings volatility.&rdquo; These &ldquo;describe the type and [quantity] of risk the business wants to and is willing to take.&rdquo;</p><p> Qualitative measures. &ldquo;Recognize that not all risk is measurable but can affect business performance. For example, appetite for business activities outside core competencies.&rdquo;</p><p> Zero tolerance risks: A subset of qualitative measures. Identify the categories of risk to eliminate. For example, regulatory non-compliance or ethics violations.</p><h3> Keys for success. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Risk appetite must support present and future strategy. </strong> A company that accepts too little risk will fail as surely as one that accepts too much.</li><li> <strong>  To ensure that the right revenue risks are accepted </strong> , senior management must be involved in the decisions that are considered most consequential to achieving plan.</li><li> <strong>  Risk appetite statements must include clear guidance for discriminating between acceptable and unacceptable risk. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> I haven&rsquo;t met any successful business developers who don&rsquo;t enjoy an occasional shot of adrenaline.

{"original_id":4457,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Aren't More Women Being Selected as Board Members?","link":"why-arent-more-women-being-selected-as-board-members","source_link":null,"content":"<p> It&rsquo;s 2016, and the workforce has become more diverse to include people of different genders, races, sexual orientations and abilities. While this is increasingly true, there&rsquo;s obviously still room for additional growth in diversity. There&rsquo;s also one critical area the business world that still remains whitewashed and male dominated: the boardroom.</p><h3> If you walk into any board meeting, it&rsquo;s very likely that you&rsquo;ll find a room filled, predominantly, with older, white men.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s always been: &ldquo;the good old boys club,&rdquo; so to speak, gathered together to make important decisions about business strategy. Remember though, it&rsquo;s 2016. Where are the women? Where&rsquo;s the diversity of gender, race, and other backgrounds that can help ensure that these important business decisions are based on broad input?</p><p> According to Emily Peck&rsquo;s Huffington Post article &ldquo; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/qualified-women-board-members-survey_us_56c35030e4b08ffac1268df5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Stop Saying There Are No Qualified Women Out There </a> ,&rdquo; women only hold 20 percent of board seats. That is a shockingly low number considering how diverse the workplace is, and also given the tendency of women to make most household purchase decisions. </p><h3> So why aren&rsquo;t more women being selected as board members?</h3><p> <br/> Peck cites a study published by Spencer Stuart (an executive recruiting firm), the WomenCorporateDirectors Foundation and Harvard researchers. The study surveyed current board members about their thoughts on why there isn&rsquo;t more diversity (specifically in regard to gender) in boardrooms. According to the study, &ldquo;The primary reason cited by men (particularly older ones) was a &lsquo;lack of qualified female candidates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> Female board members, however, perceived things differently. They believe the lack of diversity is because &ldquo;directors don't prioritize diversity,&rdquo; and because &ldquo;...predominantly male networks of corporate directors fail to uncover qualified women.&rdquo; Peck also notes, &ldquo;Men under 55 years old were less likely to see a lack of qualified women as a problem, naming male-dominated social networks as the primary factor holding women back.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, many boards fail at being inclusive of diversity because the older men in the room are, primarily, from networks that include other older men. They either still aren&rsquo;t used to seeing women as successful and qualified equals, or they don&rsquo;t travel in the same circles as these women. Either way, their unconscious biases are preventing corporate boards from thriving and growing through the diversity and inclusion that can generate new ideas. The truth is, there are plenty of qualified women who deserve to have seats at the table, and it&rsquo;s about time we gave them those seats.</p><p> For some people, old habits die hard. If you&rsquo;re trying to convince your board to create more diversity, pitching the idea to them as a business strategy. Greater diversity will provide the board with broader, more innovative ideas to help grow the company. Women (and other minority groups) will also be able to give the board insights into other demographics that represent your organization&rsquo;s target markets.

{"original_id":4458,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why People Fail When Presenting","link":"why-people-fail-when-presenting","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> You have that big presentation today. You&rsquo;re a little nervous about it, but you&rsquo;ve done everything right.</h3><p> <br/> You came up with great presentations to illustrate the current market, and you know how to use it to create a sense of urgency about purchasing your company&rsquo;s services. You spent hours to find the right way to walk them through the various services you offer and how they would integrate with their company. You&rsquo;re ready with line-by-line budgets to discuss in great depth.</p><h3> You&rsquo;re prepared with all the right things to say.</h3><p> <br/> You go into that conference room and you deliver all the information you prepared. You&rsquo;re feeling good &ndash; until you look around the room and see that no one seems terribly interested in what you have to say. Nobody even asks to see the budgets that you prepared. They all shake your hand, and you never hear from them again.</p><p> &ldquo;How could it have gone that way?&rdquo; you think to yourself. <strong>  &ldquo;I did everything right.&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> The answer? You didn&rsquo;t do everything right. In fact, you only did one thing right.</h3><p> <br/> People often think that presentations are only about communicating the information that&rsquo;s in your presentation. That&rsquo;s simply not true. Presentations are all about communicating information; it&rsquo;s information about your confidence level, your expertise, your enthusiasm, your professionalism, and your idea &ndash; in that order. Note that the thing you probably spend 95 percent of your time preparing is last.</p><p> Now, we at Startup Connection aren&rsquo;t suggesting you go out there and just worry style and ignore substance. <strong>  We are saying, though, that there are many other factors that go into a presentation that people don&rsquo;t spent much time on. Things like: </strong></p><li> <strong>  Appearance:  </strong> Take a moment and investigate the culture of the company. There are places in which wearing a suit could actually harm rapport. On the other hand, if you come from a tech company in which sandals and T-shirts are the norm, you might be starting your presentation in a rut if you walk into a company that frowns about that kind of attire. Take a look at all factors and make your choice with an intention in mind.</li><li> <strong>  Body language: </strong>  Body language plays a huge role in how you are viewed. Are you standing tall with your shoulders back, or are you hunched over a paper that you&rsquo;re reading from? When you move, are you stiff and tight or are you loose and relaxed? Do you gesticulate with confidence and authority, or do you shrug you shoulders like you&rsquo;re unsure?</li><li> <strong>  Tone of voice:  </strong> Is your voice shaky or strong? Loud or soft? Are you droning at people in monotone, or are there rises, falls, pauses, and surprises in your cadence. Your tone of voice goes a long way to project confidence and create an entertaining experience for the listener.</li><li> <strong>  Presentation length: </strong>  You may have an idea of how much time you need to detail all the things you want, but do you know how much time your audience really has to devote to this meeting? Find out and avoid one of the worst possible outcomes: having to wrap things up before you&rsquo;ve had a chance to really get into the meat and potatoes of your pitch.</li><li> <strong>  Introducing the idea: </strong>  You may have heard that &ldquo;features tell, benefits sell.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s true, but what does that really mean, and how can we use it? It&rsquo;s easy: Lead with the benefits that your prospect will experience. People think they want to know detailed specs like the resolution of a camera or how its autofocus works (features), but most people really want to know is benefits &ndash; that your photos will look clearer and less will come out blurry. If you open your pitch by telling people that they can free up 10 hours of their time per week and will ultimately save thousands per year, you&rsquo;ll have their attention. <br/>  </li><p> These things sound minor when compared to your big idea, but if you&rsquo;ve ever had someone present to you, you know that they all play a crucial role in how we view that person and their presentation. If they project confidence, we subconsciously start making positive decisions about their expertise. Very few people say yes to a pitch based on confidence alone, but it&rsquo;s absolutely key to project confidence if you want someone to seriously consider what you have to say. We love hearing great ideas, but if we can&rsquo;t immediately understand how they will help us, it&rsquo;s easy to lose interest. Substance without style sadly doesn&rsquo;t get the attention that it deserves. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Think of it this way: </strong> In a &ldquo;Few Good Men,&rdquo; would Tom Cruise have gotten Jack Nicholson&rsquo;s confession if he had tentatively approached him and, with his eyes on the floor and his voice shaky, said, <strong>  &ldquo;I want the truth &hellip;?&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> He had the right line, but if you don&rsquo;t say it the right way, it doesn&rsquo;t count for much.</h3>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-06 22:46:29.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-06 22:46:29.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_Wsq4HDh.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-people-fail-when-presenting/\", \"post_id\": \"9643\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-06 22:46:29\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-06 22:46:29\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-people-fail-when-presenting\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9642\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4627\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Why-People-Fail-When-Presenting.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"866\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457348400,"author_id":147,"chart_url":""}

I&rsquo;m sure at one time or other, we have all succumbed to those impulse purchases.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the same with book sales. Although it should make no difference to the reading experience, an attractive cover does increase sales. <strong>  But if that is the way you approach your IT spend, you&rsquo;re heading for trouble. </strong></p><p> Now you may be thinking. Hold on, that&rsquo;s what my IT department is there to protect against. That may be the case in your business, but as  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaarthur/2012/02/08/five-years-from-now-cmos-will-spend-more-on-it-than-cios-do/#4f3daa5225e2\" target=\"_blank\">   Gartner have predicted  </a>  , </u> by 2017 the majority of IT spend in companies is expected to be made by the CMO not the CIO.</p><p> There are advantages to that change. Software will need to be more accessible for business users, able to be configured without IT help, and the purchasers are likely to be closer to understanding the real business requirements. But, as Insight teams increase their budgets, there are also risks and this post explores some of the pitfalls I&rsquo;ve seen business decision makers make. Given our focus as a blog, I&rsquo;ll be concentrating on the purchase of  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/polls/poll-latest-results-analytics-software/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   analytics software  </a> </u>  on the basis of appearance.</p><h3> 1. The lure of automation &amp; de-skilling:</h3><p> <br/> Ever since the rise of BI tools in the nineties, vendors have looked for ways to differentiate their MI or analytics software from so many others on the market. Some concentrated on &ldquo;drag &amp; drop&rdquo; front-ends, some on the number of algorithms supported, some on their ease of connectivity to databases &amp; a number began to develop more &amp; more automation. This led to a few products (I&rsquo;ll avoid naming names) creating what were basically &ldquo;black box&rdquo; solutions that you were meant to trust to do all the statistics for you. They became a genre of &ldquo;trust us, look the models work&rdquo; solutions.</p><p> Such solutions can be very tempting for marketing or analytics leaders struggling to recruit or retain the analysts/data scientists they need. Automated model production, with the need for analysts seems like a real cost saving. But if you look more deeply there are a number of problems. Firstly, auto-fitted models rarely last as longer as &lsquo;hand crafted&rsquo; versions, they tend to degrade faster as it is much harder not to have overfitted the data provided. Related to this, such an approach does not benefit from real understanding of the domain being modelled (which is also a pitfall of outsourced analysts). Robust models benefit from variable &amp; algorithm selection both appropriate to the business problem &amp; knowing the meaning of the data items, as well as any likely future changes. Lastly such an approach almost always exclude meaningful &lsquo;exploratory data analysis&lsquo;, which is a huge missed opportunity as that stage more often than not adds to knowledge of data &amp; often provided insights itself. There is not yet a real alternative to the benefits of a trained statistical eye during the analytics &amp; model building process.</p><h3> 2. The quick fix of local installation:</h3><p> <br/> Unlike all the work involved in designing a data architecture &amp; appropriate data warehouse/staging/connectivity solution, analytics software is too often portrayed as a simple matter of install &amp; run. This can also be delusory. It is not just the front-end that matters with analytics software. Yes, you need that to be easy to navigate &amp; intuitive to work with (but that is becoming a hygiene factor these days). But there is more to consider round the back-end. Even if the supplier emphasises it&rsquo;s easy of connectivity with a wide range of powerful database platforms. Even if you know the investment has gone into making sure your data warehouse is powerful enough to handle all those queries. None of that will protect you from lack of analytics grunt.</p><p> The problem, all to often, is that business users are originally offered a surprisingly cheap solution that will just run locally on their PC or Mac. Now that is very convenient &amp; mobile, if you simply want to crush low volumes of data from spreadsheets or data on your laptop. But the problem comes when you want to use larger data sources &amp; have a whole analytics team trying to do so with just local installations of the same analytics software (probably paid for per install/user). Too many current generation cheaper analytics solutions will in that case be limited to the processing power of the PC or Mac. Business users are not warned of the need to consider client-server solutions, both for collaboration &amp; also to have a performant analytics infrastructure (especially if you also want to score data for live systems). That can lead to wasted initial spend as a costly server &amp; reconfiguration or even new software are needed in the end.</p><h3> 3. The drug of cloud-based solutions:</h3><p> <br/> With any product, it&rsquo;s a sound consumer maxim to beware off anything that looks too easy or too cheap. Surely such alarm bells should have rung earlier in the ears of many a marketing director who has ended up being stung by a large final &lsquo;cost of ownership&rsquo; for their cloud based CRM solution. Akin the lure of fast fix local installation, cloud based analytics solutions can promise even better, no installation at all. Pending needing firewall changes to have access to the solution, it offers the business leader the ultimate way to avoid those pesky IT folk. No wonder licences have sold.</p><p> But anyone familiar with the history of the market leaders in cloud-based solutions (and even the &lsquo;big boys&rsquo; who have jumped on the bandwagon in recent years), will know it&rsquo;s not that easy. Like providing free or cheap drugs at first, in order to create an addict, cloud-based analytics solutions have a sting in the tail. Check out the licensing agreement &amp; what you will need to scale. As use of your solution becomes more embedded in an organisation, especially if it becomes the de-facto way to access a cloud-based data solution, your users &amp; thus licence costs will gather momentum. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying they aren&rsquo;t a viable solution for some businesses. They are. But beware of the stealth sales model that is implicit.</p><h3> 4. Oh abstraction, where are you now I need you more than ever?</h3><p> <br/> Back in the nineties, the original Business Objects product, created the idea of a &ldquo;layer of abstraction&rdquo; or what they called a &ldquo;universe&rdquo;. This was configurable by the business (but probably by an experienced power user or insight analyst who knew the data), but more often than not benefited from involvement of a DBA from IT. It looked like a visual representation of a database scheme diagram and basically defined not just all the data items the analytics software could use, but also the allowed joins between tables etc. Beginning to sound rather too techie? Yes, obviously software vendors though so too. Such a definition has gone the way of metadata; perceived as a &lsquo;nice to have&rsquo; that is in reality avoided by flashy looking workarounds.</p><p> The most worrying recent cases I have seen of lacking this layer of abstraction are today&rsquo;s most popular data visualisation tools. These support a wide range of visualisations &amp; appear to make it as easy as &lsquo;drag &amp; drop&rsquo; to create any you want from the databases to which you point the software (using more mouse action). So, far so good. Regular readers will know I&rsquo;m a  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/?s=data+visualisation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data visualisation evangelist  </a> </u> . The problem is that without any defined (or controlled, to use that unpopular term) definition of data access &amp; optimal joins, the analytics queries can run amuck. I&rsquo;ve seen too many business users end up in confusion &amp; have very slow response times, basically because the software is abdicating this responsibility. Come on vendors, in a day when Hadoop et al are making the complexity of data accessed more complex, there is need for more protection not less!</p><p> Well, I hope those observations have been useful. <strong>  If they protect you from an impulse purchase without having a pre-planned analytics architecture, then my time was worthwhile. </strong></p><p> If not, well I&rsquo;m old enough to enjoy a good grumble anyway. Keep safe!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-06 23:05:06.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-06 23:05:06.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_1eusXhi.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-resist-sexy-analytics-software-quick-fixes/\", \"post_id\": \"9645\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-06 23:05:06\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-06 23:05:06\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-resist-sexy-analytics-software-quick-fixes\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9644\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4628\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-Resist-Sexy-Analytics-Software-Quick-Fixes.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"845\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457355600,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4460,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Batman v. Superman: Who Makes the Better Leader?","link":"batman-v-superman-who-makes-the-better-leader","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Later this month, comic book fans across the globe will line up to see Batman take on Superman on the silver screen in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975590/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice  </a> </u> .</h3><p> <br/> It remains to be seen how that battle will turn out. In any case, the movie provides the perfect opportunity to compare the two superheroes to see who makes the better leader. Would you rather have Batman or Superman running your operations? Here are some things to consider:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Batman is super rich </strong></h3><p> <br/> Bruce Wayne is filthy rich, which means Batman&rsquo;s got a slew of cash too. Assuming you didn&rsquo;t have to track down archenemies like Joker and Penguin, working for an extremely wealthy crimefighter would almost certainly have its perks.</p><p> According to our  <u>  Employee Engagement Report </u> , nearly 25% of employees would take another job for just a 10% raise somewhere else. Since Batman has access to seemingly infinite amounts of money, it&rsquo;s safe to say he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to pay his employees very well (at least we hope so).</p><h3> <strong>  2. Superman is super strong and fast </strong></h3><p> <br/> Superman is blessed with insane amounts of speed and strength. So he would be an enormous asset the next time your organization decided to move locations or renovate the office. The company wouldn&rsquo;t have to hire any professional movers or remodelers, and employees wouldn&rsquo;t have to break a sweat chipping in. There wouldn&rsquo;t be any downtime, either.</p><p> Just make sure you don&rsquo;t get matched up against Superman during any physical activity or game at the company picnic.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Batman has a lot of enemies </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s Joker and Penguin. There&rsquo;s also Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Two Face, Bane, Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul, and Scarecrow. The list of Batman&rsquo;s enemies goes on and on.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no shortage of folks trying to take Batman down. His long list of enemies certainly puts a damper on his business prospects. How can the Caped Crusader focus on growing his company and keeping his employees engaged when he&rsquo;s always looking over his shoulder?</p><h3> <strong>  4. Superman can be controlled with kryptonite </strong></h3><p> <br/> Some employees may daydream that they had the ability to control each and every move their boss made. With Superman at the helm of a company, that daydream can become a reality. An employee would simply have to find some kryptonite and threaten Superman every time the superhero acted against their wishes.</p><p> So while Superman may have superhuman strength, speed, and agility, he can be controlled by a rock. To be fair, the rock is hard to find. But once found, Superman becomes more or less powerless over the person who holds it.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Batman is a human being </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Even though Batman has trained incredibly hard to become as strong and powerful as he is, at the end of the day, he&rsquo;s still a human being. Since he&rsquo;s a human, he can get distracted. He can lose his temper. He can drop the ball and forget about a project. And he can burn out too.</p><p> Yes, that sounds like virtually everyone &mdash; except for Superman. Because Superman isn&rsquo;t a human being, he&rsquo;s capable of producing a lot more than his mortal counterpart. Forget missing a deadline with Superman on your side. He can cram a year&rsquo;s work of worth into a few minutes if he needs to.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Superman has superb vision and hearing </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Got drama brewing around your office?

{"original_id":4463,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Can a Recruiter Do for Me?","link":"what-can-a-recruiter-do-for-me","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> It&rsquo;s a question I get asked almost everyday.</h3><p> <br/> What do advisors who manage $2 billion, $500 million and $100 million in client assets have in common? From those I meet, a lot of things&mdash;like integrity, objectivity and a fiduciary mindset that directs their service model. There&rsquo;s also a strong focus on creating a sustainable, growth-oriented business with real enterprise value. Yet at the end of the day, nothing can have a greater impact on your business more than making sure that you are in the right place to service your clients and grow your business with the greatest potential.</p><p> So how does an advisor go about the due diligence process of comparing and contrasting where he&rsquo;s at to what&rsquo;s out there? Does he go it alone or does he use a recruiter? (Forgive me if this message comes across at all self-serving, but truth be told, I am asked this question often: &ldquo;Why use a recruiter?&rdquo;)</p><h3> From where I sit, a recruiter&rsquo;s role is to act as guide and advocate in order to: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Educate by offering access to information and solutions not always readily available or obvious. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Distill an expanded and ever-changing industry landscape, curating and customizing an appropriate list of solutions and opportunities. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Streamline and objectify what can be a dizzying process. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Negotiate and ask for things in a deal that most advisors, and even managers, would never know to ask for. </strong></li><li> <strong>  And most importantly: Share industry knowledge with competence and confidentiality; act as sounding board and trusted partner. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Recruiters in this industry work on a contingency basis at no cost to the advisors they represent.  So, if a good recruiter can do all of the above, why would someone opt not to avail himself of the service?</p><p> <strong>  The answer is simple: </strong>  Some people are just more comfortable doing &ldquo;it&rdquo; themselves&mdash;whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; is. They like to book their own vacations without a travel agent, peruse a store without a salesperson to show them around, and find the best restaurant and sites to see without the help of a hotel concierge. These folks likely take pleasure in doing their own research and having complete control over the outcome. And, when it comes to the decision of &ldquo;stay vs. go&rdquo;, they don&rsquo;t trust anyone to represent their interests as well as they could themselves.</p><p> In contrast, there are many advisors who feel that their time is best spent focusing on their core competencies&mdash;nurturing client relationships, prospecting for new business and investment management. They do not want to be distracted from any of these things in order to figure out what firms to talk to or who to meet at those firms, and they believe that it is best to let someone else &ndash;a knowledgeable and skilled expert &ndash; shepherd them through what can be a time consuming and overwhelming process. They would choose turnkey over do-it-yourself any day of the week. And the potential value add of working with a recruiter is far greater than the alternative. Aligning with a recruiter who has their best interest at heart allows them the ability to move forward in the most efficient and strategic way possible, limiting their time spent exploring and making decisions.</p><h3> The truth is that there is never just one way to skin the proverbial cat&mdash;and thus no single right way to do due diligence.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The good news is that advisors are in the driver&rsquo;s seat as this is a seller&rsquo;s market. </strong>  And no matter whether you call the restaurant yourself or let the hotel concierge handle it, you&rsquo;re likely to have a good meal.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 17:53:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 17:53:38.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_m9MBKPT.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-can-a-recruiter-do-for-me/\", \"post_id\": \"9651\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 17:53:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 17:53:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-can-a-recruiter-do-for-me\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9649\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4632\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Financial-Disadvantage-For-Women-Starts-Early.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"462\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457433000,"author_id":353,"chart_url":""}

The full details of the proposal can be found  <u>  here </u> . If adopted, it would impose much stricter AML requirements on registered investment adviser (RIA) firms.</p><p> The comment period on the rule ended on November 2, 2015 and as of yet no final rule has been announced. As the rule presently stands, It would only apply to RIA firms registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but it is possible that state regulators will also adopt similar rules in the event the federal rule is implemented. However, a similar proposal was made in 2003 and subsequently withdrawn in 2008, so whether, when, and in what format the rule will be implemented remains to be seen. </p><h3> Current AML Regulations for RIA Firms</h3><p> <br/> There is no current anti-money laundering rule that applies specifically to investment advisers. Though  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/milwaukee/press-releases/2015/tomahawk-investment-adviser-charged-with-wire-fraud-and-money-laundering\" target=\"_blank\">   adviser indictments for money laundering  </a> </u>  are not unheard of, there are presently no specific laws or regulations of which an RIA might run afoul for not implementing a robust AML program as it pertains to its clients. AML is considered the domain of &ldquo;financial institutions&rdquo; and its legal burden general falls on an investment advisory firm's custodian, not on the RIA itself.</p><p> Despite the lack of specific requirements, some state and SEC regulators will expect to see an AML policy included in an investment adviser's  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/top-ria-compliance-deficiencies-supervision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   policies and procedures manual  </a> </u>  along with evidence of its implementation. It is unfortunately a bit of a gray area &ndash; there is no written rule, and different examiners may have different perspectives on an advisory firm's role in preventing money-laundering &ndash; but a deficiency letter is certainly a possible result of an examination when no AML program exists.</p><p> It's also very important to note that while an investment advisory firm's custodian may have the ultimate responsibility in regards to AML, it's possible that the custodian may require RIA firms to fulfill certain obligations. Though the contractual terms may be vague (&ldquo;compliance with anti-money laundering rules&rdquo;), an RIA may be obligated via its custodial contract to adhere to the same AML rules to which its custodian must adhere.</p><h3> Our Recommendation as RIA Compliance Consultants</h3><p> <br/> Given the lack of a specific rule, uncertainty surrounding the implementation of FinCEN&rsquo;s proposal and the potential costs of implementing a robust AML program, what is an RIA firm to do?</p><p> While many of the rules that comprise RIA compliance are fairly cut-and-dry, anti-money laundering is an exception. Every advisory firm is suggested to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/sec-ria-compliance-conducting-a-risk-assessment\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   take a &ldquo;risk-based&rdquo; approach  </a> </u>  that factors in its own risk level based on the advisory services it provides as well as the risk levels of its clients and prospects. A well-crafted AML policy will outline the standard information the firm will collect of clients and how those records will be kept, address potential &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; for which the firm will be on the lookout, and provide a policy that outlines the firm&rsquo;s various duties depending on the situation.</p><p> Though the development of an AML program may seem intimidating and costly, the basic identification and record keeping requirements for a traditional RIA firm may be quite minimal and not much more onerous that what the firm is already doing in the normal course of business &ndash; collecting a client&rsquo;s name, date of birth, address and phone number, social security number, and a description of his or her business or primary source of funds. Only if an RIA spots &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; &ndash; such as a client who refuses to provide basic identification or has no explanation for its source of funds &ndash; would it be possibly be necessary to take specific action, including refusing to open an account or filing a Form SAR-SF.</p><h3> Final Thoughts</h3><p> <br/> Unless and until a specific rule is implemented, we caution the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/what-role-does-a-compliance-consultant-play-to-help-a-ria-firms-cco\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)  </a> </u>  every of investment advisory firm to use their best judgment when approaching AML. Have procedures to address &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; situations, but keep in mind that anti-money laundering is not one-size-fits-all and that policies can and will differ based on the specific risk levels of individual firms.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 18:21:00.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 18:21:00.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_N10LeAk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/navigating-anti-money-laundering-requirements-for-ria-firms/\", \"post_id\": \"9654\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 18:21:00\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 18:21:00\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"navigating-anti-money-laundering-requirements-for-ria-firms\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9655\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4634\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Navigating-Anti-Money-Laundering-Requirements-for-RIA-Firms.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"876\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457430300,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

Validation doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean agreeing with their fear, rather it involves recognizing and accepting their concerns and emotions.</p><p> As you validate your clients&rsquo; feelings, make sure you follow the six validation levels identified by <u>  Psychologist Marsha Linehan </u> , Ph.D. in <u>  chapter 17 of &ldquo;Empathy Reconsidered: New Directions in Psychotherapy </u> &rdquo; by Arthur C. Bohart and Leslie S. Greenberg.</p><li> <strong>  Be present </strong> - Pay complete attention to your clients&rsquo; words in a non-judgmental way. Listen with your whole mind and avoid multi-tasking (e.g. checking emails or glancing at your phone) during the conversation. Acknowledge your clients&rsquo; emotions as opposed to ignoring or avoiding them.</li><li> <strong>  Accurately reflect what you heard </strong> &ndash; Summarize what you&rsquo;ve heard from your clients about the way they feel. As an example, you could say: &ldquo;It seems as though you are very frustrated with how the markets have reacted recently.&rdquo; Clients will feel that you are trying to understand their emotions.</li><li> <strong>  Mind-read </strong> &ndash; Put yourself in your clients&rsquo; shoes and try to guess what they are feeling or thinking. Then name their emotions &ndash; for instance, you may say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you are feeling anxious and worried as a result of these highly volatile markets.&rdquo; Keep in mind that you might guess wrong and your clients may correct you. Accepting their corrections is validating them.</li><li> <strong>  Understand behavior as a consequence of history and biology  </strong> &ndash; Interpret your clients&rsquo; behaviors in the context of past experiences. If your clients lost money during volatile markets in the past, they are more likely to be worried about such thing happening again now.</li><li> <strong>  Normalize reactions </strong> &ndash; Help your clients realize their reactions are normal. Let them know that many investors become anxious and fearful during volatile times, and that it is totally understandable to feel that way.</li><li> <strong>  Apply radical genuineness </strong> &ndash; Try to understand your clients&rsquo; emotions on a deeper level and share a similar experience you have had or are currently going through. If you invest your money alongside your clients&rsquo;, let them know that you know exactly how it feels to be an investor in this market environment.  <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once you have validated your clients&rsquo; feelings, you may want to engage them in more positive thinking by using a simplified version of what psychologists call cognitive behavioral therapy.</p><p> According to mental health and well-being nonprofit <u>  <a href=\"http://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/therapy-for-anxiety-disorders.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   HelpGuide.org  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most widely-used therapy for anxiety disorders. It addresses negative patterns and distortions in the way we look at the world and ourselves.&rdquo;  The basic premise is that our thoughts &mdash;as opposed to the events themselves&mdash; affect the way we feel.</p><p> You may want to use the cognitive behavioral approach to identify the negative thinking patterns of your clients that contribute to their anxiety, and replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts. This communications process involves three steps:</p><li> <strong>  Identify clients&rsquo; negative thoughts </strong></li><li> <strong>  Challenge these thoughts </strong></li><li> <strong>  Replace them with realistic thoughts to create a more positive perception </strong> <br/>  </li><p> An example is shown below:</p><h3> <strong>  Challenging Investors&rsquo; Negative Thoughts </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Negative thought #1:  </strong> What if volatility remains and markets don&rsquo;t ever recover?</p><p> <strong>  Cognitive distortion: </strong>  Predicting the worst.</p><p> <strong>  More realistic thought: </strong>  Volatility is a temporary condition and markets tend to recover from downturns, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that the opposite will happen now.</p><p> &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;</p><p> <strong>  Negative thought #2: </strong>  If I lose the value of my investments, it will be terrible!</p><p> <strong>  Cognitive distortion: </strong>  Blowing things out of proportion.</p><p> <strong>  More realistic thought: </strong>  Your investments may lose value temporarily, but it is likely that they will revamp in the longer term. Our investment strategy is doing what it has been designed to do, and as market conditions improve, so may the value of your investments.</p><p> &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;</p><p> <strong>  Negative thought #3:  </strong> I&rsquo;ve made poor investment decisions.</p><p> <strong>  Cognitive distortion: </strong>  Jumping to conclusions.</p><p> <strong>  More realistic thought: </strong>  Stay focused on the long-term. You didn&rsquo;t sign up for selling low. This may be a good opportunity to buy cheap and remain patient as the markets begin to recover.</p><p> &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;</p><p> This communication exercise may help change investors&rsquo; negative perceptions during volatile times. As <u>  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pieces-mind/201208/few-the-many-ways-we-distort-reality\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ph.D. Psychologist Karyn Hall  </a> </u> says, &ldquo;&hellip; perceptions are often inaccurate, particularly in emotionally charged situations.&rdquo;</p><p> Hall explains that perceptions lead to confirmation bias. &ldquo;When you have an idea in your mind you tend to look for evidence that supports that idea and not pay attention to evidence that says the idea isn&rsquo;t accurate.&rdquo; Therefore, it is important that you provide your clients with information that they may overlook in times of uncertainty, such as historical data showing how the markets have recovered from previous downturns.</p><p> These validation and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques may help you communicate more effectively with clients during times of high market volatility. Effective communication strategies during sensitive times may strengthen relationships and build greater trust. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 18:35:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 18:35:21.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_JoyJWii.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/addressing-investors-emotions/\", \"post_id\": \"9657\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 18:35:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 18:35:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"addressing-investors-emotions\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9656\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4635\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Addressing-Investors-Emotions.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1059\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457443800,"author_id":124,"chart_url":""}

For more than 150 years, Somerville, Massachusetts absorbed wave after wave of immigrants. Today, hipster professionals are pouring into this city next door to Boston.Somerville rents have shot up as much as 50 percent in 15 years, and a two-bedroom apartment for under $2,000 in a shabby chic neighborhood is a rare find.A similar trend is playing out all over the country &ndash; from Boston and Miami to Los Angeles and Seattle &ndash; and it&rsquo;s squeezing working- and middle-class families the most, according to the <u>  <a href=\"https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/americas_rental_housing_2015_web.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University  </a> </u> .Although low-income households are by far the most burdened by their housing costs, &ldquo;the more prominent story is that we&rsquo;re starting to see, in middle incomes, a much higher incidence of being cost burdened,&rdquo; said Jonathan Spader, a senior research associate at the Center.</p><h3> Nationwide, the share of renter households earning between $30,000 and $44,999 who are either &ldquo;moderately&rdquo; or &ldquo;severely&rdquo; burdened by housing costs has increased sharply, from 37 percent in 2001 to more than 48 percent in 2014, the Center found.</h3>The share of burdened households with earnings in the $45,000-$74,999 range increased from about 12 percent of these renters to more than 21 percent. A disproportionate share of them is either under age 25 or over 65.The Center defines a moderate burden as having to spend anywhere from 30 percent to half of household members&rsquo; combined earnings on housing costs &ndash; severely burdened households spend more than half.The share of severely burdened households, though relatively small, has also doubled since 2001 &ndash; to 10 percent of households in the $30,000-$44,999 income range and 2.4 percent in the $45,000-$74,999 range.What&rsquo;s driving this trend? One reason is that middle incomes haven&rsquo;t kept up with rent increases, especially in metropolitan areas. And rents are being pushed up by growing demand: there are 9 million more renters nationwide than a decade ago, bringing renter households to their highest level since the mid-1960s, according to the Center.Rising demand was also fueled by the foreclosure crisis, which threw owners out of their homes and forced them to rent, and by tightening credit, which made it more difficult to be approved for a mortgage, Spader said. Yet new rental housing units aren&rsquo;t keeping up with rising demand.And there&rsquo;s no sign the pressure on rental properties will be relieved anytime soon. The large Millennial generation born between 1985 and 2004 will continue to move out of their parents&rsquo; homes and into their own apartments.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to come,&rdquo; Spader said.","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 18:58:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 18:58:23.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_3uuWUb4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/no-end-in-sight-rising-rents-are-slamming-the-middle-class/\", \"post_id\": \"9659\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 18:58:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 18:58:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"no-end-in-sight-rising-rents-are-slamming-the-middle-class\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9658\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4636\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-Rising-Rents-Are-Slamming-the-Middle-Class_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"822\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"30\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457452800,"author_id":280,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4468,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Determining the Liquidity of an ETF","link":"determining-the-liquidity-of-an-etf","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Does Volume Really Matter?</h3><p> <br/> Underlying liquidity will begin to tell the story of how liquid an ETF could be, no matter what the average daily volume (ADV). But how do you measure that liquidity? For equity-based ETFs, a first step is to examine the top 10 holdings to see if they are &ldquo;household&rdquo; names. If they are not, you may want to investigate further, utilizing a tool such as Bloomberg&rsquo;s implied liquidity field listing. For fixed income or derivative-based ETFs, call the sponsor and speak to someone on the capital markets team, call your block desk or reach out to a liquidity provider and ask what would happen if you traded X amount of shares. </p><h3> What Factors Determine the Liquidity of an ETF?</h3><p> <br/> Is it how many shares can be bought at the ask price or sold at the bid price? Is it the average daily volume over a certain time period? Or the liquidity of the underlying securities? Understanding what creates liquidity in an ETF will help guide advisors to the best possible execution method for a given ETF trade. Let&rsquo;s explore what makes an ETF liquid and, specifically, whether there should be a concern in trading an ETF with a lower average daily volume (ADV). </p><h3> Understanding an ETF's Open-Ended Structure</h3><p> <br/> First of all, it is critical to understand that ETFs trade quite differently than stocks and other investments that are traded on an exchange (e.g., options or closed end funds). While they do have an open-ended structure, shares can be added or subtracted at any time through a process called creation/redemption. In a creation transaction, an authorized participant (AP) &ndash; a market maker or a large trading firm that handles all aspects of client activity itself &ndash; assembles a portfolio or basket of securities that comprises the ETF unit. Typically, the portfolio involves 50,000 or 100,000 shares as determined by the ETF sponsor. The AP then turns the basket over to an ETF distributor and a custodian. In exchange for the basket of securities, the ETF custodian provides shares of the ETF to the AP at the net asset value. In a redemption transaction, the process works in reverse.</p><p> This structural process allows ETFs to trade at or near what is perceived as fair value. If the ETF was priced incorrectly, trading firms could take advantage of the arbitrage mechanism, which would ultimately move the price back in line with its fair value. </p><h3> Average Daily Volume (ADV) is Only Part of the Picture</h3><p> <br/> The secondary market is where all investors can trade. When pulling up a quote on a proprietary system or through a financial website, the secondary market is what you see. The components of such quotes are usually the last trade, the bid price and ask price (the spread), the number of shares that can be sold or bought at each price point and the volume of shares traded so far that day. A common misconception holds that to get best execution an ETF must possess significant average daily trading volume. But onscreen volume isn&rsquo;t a proxy for ETF liquidity. That&rsquo;s because executed share volume pertains only to the secondary market exchanges on which the ETFs trade.1 It is only an indication of what has traded, not what could trade. What can&rsquo;t be seen in a normal quote system (unless it is a paid subscription system) is market depth, meaning all the quotes behind the inside quote that can add to the liquidity of an ETF.</p><h3> The Most Important Consideration: The Liquidity of the Underlying Securities</h3><p> <br/> Another driver of liquidity that is not readily apparent is the actual liquidity of the underlying securities within the ETF itself. Underlying liquidity will begin to tell the story of how liquid an ETF could be, no matter what the ADV. But how do you measure that liquidity? Different types of ETFs are going to be more liquid than others. For example, large cap U.S. equity funds will be much more liquid than emerging market bonds. A simple first step is to examine the top 10 holdings. If the major holdings are &ldquo;household&rdquo; names in their categories, this may provide you with a good starting point for further analysis. You may also want to investigate further, utilizing a tool such as Bloomberg&rsquo;s implied liquidity field. This field basically estimates how many shares you can trade before you begin to potentially impact the price.</p><h3> Be Skeptical</h3><p> <br/> In creating a customized due diligence process, advisors must take care to avoid some of the most common misconceptions. Following are three key considerations.</p><p> <strong>  Hypothetical ETF Liquidity Example  <br/>  30-day Average Daily Volume: 15,820  <br/>  Bloomberg Implied Liquidity Number 3.4 million shares  <br/>  Top 10 Holdings  </strong></p><p> At first glance, the historical volume in the hypothetical example above (15,820), may lead you to think that it is not a very liquid ETF. By analyzing both the fund&rsquo;s top 10 holdings and reviewing the implied liquidity, you can see that an investor could potentially trade roughly 3.4 million shares (see Table 1 below) before having an impact on the price.</p><p> However, keep in mind there are times when an incorrect security shows up in the calculation, which can skew the number. That&rsquo;s why it is important to look at more than one metric to see if an ETF is liquid.</p><p> Below is the implied liquidity table for all FlexShares equity based ETFs:</p><p> <strong>  On the surface, ETFs that have low volume may appear to be less liquidity, but that may not always be the case. Though it may take a little more time to trade a lower volume ETF, taking the time to evaluate all of your possible options may help to differentiate you from others who don&rsquo;t want to put the time and energy into understanding how to achieve best execution. </strong></p><h3> The Exception: Fixed Income ETFs</h3><p> <br/> The downside to looking at the top 10 holdings or the implied liquidity number is that it only works for equity based ETFs. The liquidity of fixed income or derivative-based ETFs is a little more difficult to gauge and implied liquidity is not calculated for fixed income or futures based ETFs. When it comes to fixed income ETFs, it is even more critical to understand the liquidity of the underlying securities. As an example, let&rsquo;s look at the ultra-short market since this category does not invest in government securities as its primary goal. Many investors would think that these securities are very liquid and easy to buy because they are traded more frequently or they mature faster. However, that is not always the case. Another misconception is that these securities have a very tight trading spread. Again, that is not usually the case.

With increasing complexity come many options they must evaluate, as well as new responsibilities.  Millennials are more educated that prior generations, but they are also saddled with greater student loan debt than any prior generation.  And, despite their higher level of education, they get low marks for financial literacy according to a recent U.S. Treasury Department and Department of Education assessment.</p><h3> What are they doing about their finances?</h3>Sources like Pew Research Center tell us that many Millennials seek advice from their parents.  Unlike Boomers who did not want to speak to their parents, Millennials often share interests with their parents and correspondingly seek their counsel.However, taking financial advice from their parents may not a good approach because many of their parents lack sufficient savings to fund their retirement needs.  Mark Grimaldi, co-author of &ldquo;The Money Compass: Where Your Money Went and How to Get It Back&rdquo; says &ldquo;never take advice from someone less successful than you are.&rdquo;  He continues: &ldquo;With almost 30 years investment experience, I can say with complete confidence that many baby boomers, the parents of Gen Yers, are in a financial mess.&rdquo;<h3> What, then, should Millennials do then?</h3>Talking to their parents is not inherently bad, so long as that is not their sole source.  &ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s a difference between receiving [parental] advice and relying solely on the advice given,&rdquo; says Kristen Robinson, senior vice president of Fidelity Investments&rsquo; women and young investors&rsquo; products. &ldquo;Gen Y should listen to what parents have to say.  But at the end of the day, financial decisions are personal matters and best made after carefully considering a number of factors and doing research.&rdquo; <u> From Millennials: Stop Taking Financial Advice From Mom and Dad</u> &mdash; she concludes that Millennials really need to do is find ethical professionals for help.<h3> So, how do they do this?</h3>They search the internet of things, of course!

{"original_id":4470,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Stimulus Control Guidelines","link":"stimulus-control-guidelines","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Set a Reasonable Bedtime and Arising Time and Stick to Them.</h3><p> <br/> Spending excessive time in bed has two unfortunate consequences: (1) you begin to associate your bedroom with arousal and frustration, and (2) your sleep actually becomes more shallow. Set the alarm clock and get out ofbed at the same time in the morning, weekdays and weekends, regardless ofyour bedtime or the amount ofsleep you obtained on the previous night. You probably will be tempted to stay in bed in designed to regulate your internal biological clock and reset your sleep-wake rhythm.</p><h3> Go to Bed Only When You Are Sleepy.</h3><p> <br/> There is no reason to go to bed ifyou are not sleepy. When you go to bed early, it only gives you more time to become frustrated. Individuals often ponder the events ofthe day, plan the next day&rsquo;s schedule, or worry about their inability to fall asleep. Therefore, you should delay your bedtime until you are sleepy. This may mean that you go to bed even later than your scheduled bedtime. Remember to stick to your scheduled arising time regardless ofthe time you go to bed.</p><h3> Get Out of Bed When You Cannot Fall Asleep or Go Back to Sleep in about 15 Minutes. Repeat This Step as Often as Necessary.</h3><p> <br/> Although we do not want you to be a clock-watcher, get out ofbed if you do not fall asleep fairly soon. Remember, the goal is for you to fall asleep quickly. Return to bed only when you are sleepy. The object is for you to reconnect your bed with sleeping rather than frustration. It will be demanding to follow this instruction, but many people have found ways to adhere to this guideline.</p><h3> Use the Bed or Bedroom for Sleep and Sex Only. Do Not Watch Television, Listen to Radio, Eat or Read in Your Bedroom.</h3><p> <br/> The purpose ofthe guideline is to associate your bedroom with sleep rather than wakefulness. Just as you may associate the kitchen with hunger, this guideline will help you associate sleep with your bedroom. Follow this rule both during the day and at night. You may have to temporarily move the television and/or radio from your bedroom to help during treatment.</p><p> Allow Yourself at Least an Hour Before Bedtime to Unwind. The brain is not a light switch that you can instantly shut on and off. Most ofus cannot expect to go to bed until 8:00 P.M. and then fall peacefully asleep at 8:15. Take a hot bath, read a novel, watch some television, or have a pleasant talk with your spouse or kids. Find what works for you. Be sure not to struggle with a problem, get into an argument before bed, or do anything else that might increase your arousal.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 19:51:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 19:51:13.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_MIYmFNZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/stimulus-control-guidelines/\", \"post_id\": \"9665\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 19:51:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 19:51:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"stimulus-control-guidelines\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9664\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4639\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stimulus-Control-Guidelines_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"915\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457467200,"author_id":157,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4471,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Questions to Ask Yourself If Your Team Isn't Listening","link":"10-questions-to-ask-yourself-if-your-team-isnt-listening","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Her call touched me deeply. She was trying so hard&hellip;to establish the right vision, to key in on the important behaviors, to scaffold and develop&hellip;and her team just wasn&rsquo;t listening. <br/>  </h3><p> Perhaps you&rsquo;ve been there too. You&rsquo;ve got vision. You care deeply. You teach. You repeat yourself. But no one seems to &ldquo;get it&rdquo;?</p><p> Here are 10 questions worth asking when you hit that wall and when your team is just not listening. </p><p> <strong>  1) Do you say it in different ways? </strong></p><p> People learn differently&mdash;some by seeing things, some by hearing, some through practice, and so on. As you practice communicating frequently, use different techniques. Repeat critical information at least six times through three or more channels. For example, to communicate a new procedure, you might use email, a staff meeting, and one-on-one meetings for your three channels.</p><p> <strong>  2) Do you say it often enough? </strong></p><p> We have worked with so many frustrated leaders who complain that their team is insubordinate or unresponsive. When asked if they communicated the issue to their team, they say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Here are a few of the answers we got when we asked, When was the last time you communicated the issue? <br/> &ldquo;Last year.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;At that off-site the year before last.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;We were in the hallway six months ago.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;At the staff meeting last month.&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;In an email.&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve communicated something once, you haven&rsquo;t communicated. Managers who win well communicate frequently.</p><p> <strong>  3) Do you check for understanding? </strong></p><p> An idea is rarely as clear to the listener as it is to the speaker. Ask your listeners what they heard, what they understood you to be asking, and what they understand the consequences to be.</p><p> <strong>  4) Have you explained the &ldquo;whys&rdquo;? </strong></p><p> Even military briefings include the reasons and objectives behind the orders. Sometimes people&rsquo;s lack of response results from not understanding the consequences of their action or inaction.</p><p> <strong>  5) Are you ordering or inviting? </strong></p><p> Invitation is the language of collaboration. We don&rsquo;t mean the literal phrasing of the words (although that can make a difference too), so much as the attitude behind them. People know when you focus on relationships along with results. Do you communicate that you&rsquo;re better than everyone else and they should serve you? Or do you invite people with mutual dignity to participate with you?</p><p> <strong>  6) Do  you know what matters to them? </strong></p><p> Everyone values something. If the values you promote conflict with your people&rsquo;s values, you&rsquo;ll have trouble being heard.</p><p> <strong>  7) Do you have credibility? </strong></p><p> If your team can say, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; and they have evidence to back up their conclusion, expect to be ignored. Credibility is built, not demanded. If you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing in a certain arena, admit it and seek out others with the expertise to supplement what you do know. When your people can&rsquo;t trust you or rely on you, but you insist on compliance, you fight an uphill battle you cannot win in the long run.</p><p> <strong>  ￼8) Do you listen? </strong></p><p> If you don&rsquo;t hear what people tell you, they&rsquo;ll naturally think you don&rsquo;t care, they&rsquo;ll lose heart, and they will stop caring. To learn whether or not you&rsquo;re hearing people, ask a few team members to share with you: &ldquo;Is there anything you&rsquo;ve been trying to tell me that I&rsquo;m just not hearing?&rdquo; Be quiet and listen. Thank them for sharing, and respond in time. You don&rsquo;t have to agree, but you do need to hear. It takes both internal values of confidence and humility to truly listen without defending yourself. When you listen, you strengthen the connection with your people and learn what areas of training, execution, and accountability need attention.</p><p> <strong>  9) Do you speak their language? </strong></p><p> Do the words and concepts you use mean the same thing to your team that they mean to you? Do you share numbers and facts when stories and demonstrations are needed&mdash;or vice versa?</p><p> <strong>  10) What do you really want? </strong></p><p> Whenever you have management challenges, the first thing to examine is your own motivation. Are you truly focused on results and relationships, or are other self-protecting or self motivations creeping in? There&rsquo;s a big difference between wanting what&rsquo;s best for the team and wanting what&rsquo;s best for you. So what is it you really want? If the answer is submission&mdash;&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s best, and they&rsquo;d better listen to me&rdquo;&mdash;then you won&rsquo;t ever have a team that wins well. They will act out of fear when they have to and ignore you when they feel it&rsquo;s safe. </p><p> If you feel as if no one&rsquo;s listening, ask yourself these 10 questions, be honest with yourself, and take action in response to your answers. </p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 20:26:23.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 20:26:23.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_ER30euf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-questions-to-ask-yourself-if-your-team-isnt-listening/\", \"post_id\": \"9667\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 20:26:23\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 20:26:23\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-questions-to-ask-yourself-if-your-team-isnt-listening\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9666\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4640\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10-Questions-to-Ask-Yourself-If-Your-Team-Isnt-Listening.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"732\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457460000,"author_id":262,"chart_url":""}

Simply put, attracting and retaining your ideal customers requires sharing valuable information with them, showing that you are not only the best people to solve their problems, but you are already doing so for others - and, by implication, can do the same for them if they so choose. </p><p> Most brands have some sort of content strategy or program in place but, far too often in the financial services industry, it&rsquo;s probably one of questionable effectiveness. If you&rsquo;re one of the  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/dont-trip-content-marketing-financial-services\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  72% of Australian marketers who haven&rsquo;t found success </a>  (success defined as having achieved business objectives, which in most cases means revenue generated) in their content marketing efforts, it&rsquo;s probably time to step your content marketing game up.</p><h3> Here are some insights on how.</h3><p> <br/> So, you&rsquo;ve got your buyer personas. Tick. Now here&rsquo;s the important part: you need to map your content to each persona&rsquo;s buyer journey. Content can help influence a buyer&rsquo;s decision if &ndash; and only if &ndash; we deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time.</p><p> The buyer&rsquo;s journey is defined as the active research process a potential buyer goes through leading up to a purchase. Your content should be designed to guide prospects along the way, from awareness through consideration to the actual decision and purchase.</p><p> <img alt=\"ACD_top_PNG.png\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/ACD_top_PNG.png?t=1457059533790&amp;width=640\"/></p><p> To reach users in each stage, we must first understand their thought processes, behaviours and information needs.</p><h3> Awareness</h3><p> <br/> Someone in the awareness stage has realised and expressed symptoms of a potential problem &ndash; this is the perfect time to jump in and offer relevant, educational content which shows that you understand their problem. For example, for a provider of a personal finance app, a user in this stage is thinking about their spending habits and wondering if he/she needs to start saving more. They might find an online article &ldquo;5 Easy Ways to Grow Your Savings&rdquo; interesting. &ldquo;Improve&rdquo;, &ldquo;troubleshoot&rdquo; and &ldquo;prevent&rdquo; are words the potential buyer might use when searching for solutions to their problem. You should  use them when optimising for SEO. Since users are at the start of their information search at this stage, be neutral in your messaging. In other words, stay far, far away from the product push.</p><h3> Consideration</h3><p> <br/> In the consideration stage, a user has a more clearly defined need and is actively searching for solutions. This is where you can play a part in influencing their solution strategy by providing solution-focused content. Use words like &ldquo;solution&rdquo;, &ldquo;tool&rdquo; and &ldquo;service&rdquo;. A mortgage loan provider might reach a consideration stage user through a video guide by an expert, entitled &ldquo;Refinancing home loans and other alternatives - which solution suits you best?&rdquo; An investment manager might reach a consideration stage potential investor through an eGuide entitled &ldquo;Shares, bonds, or options - which is the right investment for your risk appetite?&rdquo;</p><h3> Decision</h3><p> <br/> A user in the decision stage is seeking validation to determine their shortlist and finally select a provider. This would be a good time to talk about the benefits of using your brand or product over others - while trying to be as objective as possible. Use strong proof points, like case studies, third party comparisons and even offer trials. Words to use in this stage are &ldquo;comparison&rdquo;, &ldquo;pros and cons&rdquo; and &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo;. A health insurance provider could publish a checklist comparing important product features, positioning itself as the clear winner.</p><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve got the methodology down pat, use it when you&rsquo;re planning your content calendar but also apply it to ALL your existing content through a detailed content audit. Tedious, we know - but this way you&rsquo;ll know what sort of content, in what formats, you&rsquo;ll need to create or repurpose.

{"original_id":4473,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"4 Easy Ways to Better Engage Your Twitter Audience","link":"4-easy-ways-to-better-engage-your-twitter-audience","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> There are more than 320 million active Twitter users around the globe. <br/>  </h3><p> In this day and age, having a presence on this giant of a social media platform is crucial to the success of your business. Twitter provides a medium that enables advisors to connect to their target audience and helps them to reach new prospects.</p><p> On average, around 6,000 tweets are sent out each second. That&rsquo;s 500 million tweets per day. People may take notice to your tweets or they may scroll past them&hellip;it is all in how you craft your Twitter strategy.</p><p> Here are four easy ways to better engage your Twitter audience:</p><p> <strong>  1) A picture is worth one million characters </strong></p><p> About 90% of information that comes to the brain is visual. If you want people to stop scrolling and notice your content &ndash; use a visual.</p><p> Generally speaking, as an advisor, you work with numbers. Using graphs is a great way to visually share this type of information with your audience. Statistics show that content with a visual component gets 94% more views than those without. </p><p> About 65% of senior marketing executives believe that visual assets (photos, videos and infographics) are core to how their brand story is communicated. Images evoke emotional responses to readers, and the use of the right picture can bring out strong emotions and reactions in your readers (happiness, compassion, disgust, or sadness).</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to remember that the majority of readers will scan a page rather than read it word for word.  In a world where people are constantly bombarded with content, one of the most successful ways to capture your audience&rsquo;s attention, especially the scanners, is through the use of visual assets.</p><p> Captivate your audience and allow them to visualize your message through the use of visual assets.</p><p> <strong>  2) Use #hashtags </strong></p><p> Twitter is famous for its use of hashtags. Although, hashtags may not contribute towards your engagement rate to the extent that you may think. Yes, using hashtags will allow you, as a Financial Advisor, to reach your target audience. And yes, hashtags help to expand your reach on Twitter. That being said, when it comes to hashtags, less is more. According to a study done by LocoWise, adding too many hashtags to your posts can actually decrease your engagement rate as shown in the table below.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tweet_with_corresponding_number_of_hashtags.png\" width=\"879\"/> As a Financial Advisor, hashtags also allow you to see what is trending, what questions or challenges your audience is having, as well as new technology or information that is relevant to your field. Some popular hashtags in the Financial Services industry include:</p><li> #FinServ</li><li> #Advisors</li><li> #FinPlan</li><p> <strong>  3) Tweet, tweet, tweet! </strong></p><p> Set goals for your Twitter account that focus on how often you post per day or week. A great way to stay on track is to schedule your tweets using a social media management system such as Hootsuite. The more you tweet about topics relevant to the financial industry, the more of the right attention you will get &ndash; but be sure you are sharing valuable and unique content, and not just posting for the sake of posting.</p><p> Also, people like to see that you are engaged on Twitter. If you see an interesting article that you want to share with others &ndash; retweet it! This will help you build relationships with other users. Staying in the loop with current news and trends shows your audience that you are ahead of the curve.</p><p> Millennials are the next investors, and more importantly your future clients. This means that tailoring your marketing strategy to their habits should be a priority. An easy way to stay on top of Twitter is to set aside 15 minutes per day to schedule your tweets.</p><p> <strong>  4) Join in with discussions </strong></p><p> The beauty of Twitter is that you can interact with as many people as you&rsquo;d like.</p><p> This is where the @ sign comes into play. This is one of the most important influencers of engagement on Twitter. This feature allows you to directly communicate with other users on Twitter by answering your @ replies and tagging others when you comment or share their content. Over time, this will allow you to build relationships with your audience, and more importantly with your influencers.</p><p> Industry influencers, on social media, are some of the most trusted sources of information. Do some research and find out who your influencers are. Connecting with these influencers will help to increase your reach, credibility and overall social media image.</p><p> Joining discussions will keep you in the loop of what your prospects and clients are saying and what questions they&rsquo;re asking. For Advisors, joining in on discussions and sharing useful content can help you to become a thought leader in the industry. People will start coming to you for answers and insights because you have built trust with them.</p><p> Gaining insight on what your prospects and clients are interested in or what is challenging them is also a great source for new content ideas. Learning from your audience will enable you to post unique content that is aimed at solving and educating them on their greatest financial challenges.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 21:31:34.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 21:31:34.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_sk6kl2K.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/4-easy-ways-to-better-engage-your-twitter-audience/\", \"post_id\": \"9672\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 21:31:34\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 21:31:34\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"4-easy-ways-to-better-engage-your-twitter-audience\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9670\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4642\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4_Easy_Ways_to_Better_Engage_Your_Twitter_Audience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"505\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457455500,"author_id":195,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4475,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Well Do You Know Your Financial Advisor? 5 Questions You Should Ask","link":"how-well-do-you-know-your-financial-advisor-5-questions-you-should-ask","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  How do you choose the right person to guide you in financial matters? </strong> Since the person you choose will be privy to some very personal information, you need to ask the right questions before you start a relationship with them. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to interview a prospective advisor and get a feel for that person&rsquo;s style before deciding whether to work with them. If you are already working with a financial advisor, it&rsquo;s never too late to ask questions about your plan and why your advisor has recommended a certain investment for you.</p><h3> <strong>  5 Questions to Ask your Financial Advisor </strong></h3><h3> <br/> What are your qualifications for working in the financial services industry?</h3><p> <br/> Not everyone working in this industry has the same credentials. It is important that the credentials that a financial advisor has are relevant to the work they are doing. For instance, if they are buying and selling stocks they must have their securities license and further licensing to sell more complex financial products (i.e. options license). If the advisor sells insurance they need to have the suitable insurance licenses (you need a separate license to sell car insurance than to sell life insurance). If you want a financial plan, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) is licensed and qualified to provide detailed financial plans.</p><p> Be sure the advisor you choose to work with has the qualifications necessary to meet your financial needs. For example, I am a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and have my Financial Management Advisor (FMA) designation. I am also licensed to sell securities such as mutual funds, stocks and bonds and insurance products (disability, critical illness and life insurance). These designations qualify me to be a full service, one-stop financial advisor for my clients. I can manage their money, provide advice and detailed financial plans, protect their family and income through insurance solutions and help make estate planning recommendations.</p><h3> What kind of experience do you have in the industry?</h3><p> <br/> It important not only to know your advisor&rsquo;s qualifications but also what their experience is, so ask a few questions before deciding who you are going to work with. For instance, I have been in the industry for more than 27 years with the same firm. Ask the advisors you are interviewing how long have they been in the industry and how have they been with the company they are working with.</p><p> How many other firms have they worked for? If they move around firms frequently you might want to ask why. You don&rsquo;t want to sign up with a new advisor just as they are changing firms again. If the advisor is new to the industry, ask what their previous career was and why they made the switch. You don&rsquo;t want to be handing over your nest egg to just anyone. Get to know your advisor before making any decisions.</p><h3> How do you get paid?</h3><p> <br/> All financial advisors, financial planners or investment advisors get paid in one way or another. It may be 100% commission, commission plus fees, fee only or salary plus bonuses. One way is not better than another to earn income as an advisor as long as clients understand how their advisor is being paid and what exactly they are being paid for.</p><h3> How much do I pay for your services?</h3><p> <br/> By hiring a financial or investment advisor, you will pay some sort of fee. It might be an up-front fee such as commissions on trades or quarterly management fees. Sometimes the fees are embedded within the investments, as mutual funds often are. For example, I tend to use mainly managed investment pools that incorporate fees into the unit prices. So clients do not pay me directly but instead I am paid by the financial firm whose investments I sell.</p><p> Ask the advisor about their fees before deciding to work with them to be sure you are both on the same page on what you agree to pay for the services offered.</p><h3> What is your investment style?</h3><p> <br/> Every advisor has his or her own style or philosophy when it comes to investing. Some advisors are more risk takers than others. Some trade frequently, while others prefer to buy quality investments and just hold. It is really important to understand your advisor&rsquo;s investment style to be sure it is in line with what you&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p><h3> Who is your ideal client?</h3><p> <br/> In the same way that other professionals develop specialties, advisors prefer to work with certain types of clients &ndash; maybe retirees or medical professionals, for example. Asking this question will help you discover whether you and your portfolio would be a good fit for that advisor. For instance, I tend to work with the middle class baby-boomer who has little time but a sizable portfolio ($250,000 and up) and needs someone to step in to help put their financial house in order; develop a financial plan and conduct an insurance review, educate on pensions and retirement options, manage money, create cash-flow in retirement, provide recommendations for estate planning and on and on.</p><p> I know it can be difficult to ask financial professionals questions concerning their business practices but it&rsquo;s crucial to do before handing your money and your financial future over to someone new.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-07 21:41:15.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-07 21:41:15.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_TQJ8ZXb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-well-do-you-know-your-financial-advisor-5-questions-you-should-ask/\", \"post_id\": \"9674\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-07 21:41:15\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-07 21:41:15\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-well-do-you-know-your-financial-advisor-5-questions-you-should-ask\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9670\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4644\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4_Easy_Ways_to_Better_Engage_Your_Twitter_Audience.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"604\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457467500,"author_id":398,"chart_url":""}

It builds instant trust, likability and authenticity. It gives others a quick peak into your character while providing the WHY that clients are craving. Without your story your work is just work, your job is just a job your value replaceable.  </p><p> The process of writing your story is as powerful as sharing your story is with others. It is a journey that will refuel your practice and ability to succeed. It&rsquo;s a process that requires peeling the onion, stripping deep layers of old scripts, traditional messaging and industry protocol to get to the true story, why you really do what you do.  </p><p> This can become a startling adventure, the root of your purpose often being nothing what you thought. It has been so deeply embedded in your soul, safely protected from being vulnerable or subjected to unwanted scrutiny that at first it may be hard to find.</p><p> For some the journey to the truth can be challenging and ultimately emotional which only makes it more powerful and effective when you uncover your truth. In time your journey becomes cleansing, liberating and rejuvenating.</p><p> As you develop your story and your true source and purpose becomes unveiled you may feel as if a weight has been lifted off your shoulders, as if a wisp of energy is released like helium lifting a balloon.</p><p> All of a sudden things become clearer, all the pieces between your life and business start to connect. These new emotions are hard to define, it&rsquo;s as if a new sense of peace and calmness is colliding with a burst of energy, and the warmth of a raging fire.

{"original_id":4477,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Tuning Out the White Noise in High Yield","link":"tuning-out-the-white-noise-in-high-yield","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Gershon_Distenfeld\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gershon Distenfeld  </a> </u>  </p><p> The sound and fury surrounding high yield these days can make it hard for investors to hear themselves think. It&rsquo;s time to turn down the volume. Here are four things to keep in mind:</p><h3> <strong>  1. This isn&rsquo;t 2008 all over again.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The recent sell-off looks a lot more like what the market endured in  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/post/en/2016/01/the-high-yield-sell-off-more-like-2002-than-2008\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2002  </a> </u> . Back then, the bursting of the dot-com bubble exposed excessive borrowing at many telecom companies, which had become a large share of the overall market. That led to higher defaults in that sector and a sell-off across the high-yield market. Sounds familiar, right? This time, the trouble is mostly in energy, metals and mining&mdash;sectors hurt by falling commodity prices.</p><p> So what should investors expect?  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/post/en/2016/01/high-yield-defaults-may-rise-but-mostly-in-commodity-sectors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Defaults will probably rise  </a> </u>  &mdash; especially among commodity-dependent companies. But issuers in other sectors will likely benefit from lower oil prices. That suggests plenty of upside in the years ahead. Remember, investors who bought non-telecom sectors of the market in the years after the 2002 sell-off did quite well.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Many high-yield bonds are attractively priced. </strong>  </h3><p> <br/> Over the last several months, global investors have punished high yield indiscriminately, and that presents an opportunity for the value minded. The yield-to-worst of the Barclays US High Yield Index sits above 9%. It dipped below 5% in mid-2014. Yields are even higher now on some individual non-energy sector bonds.</p><p> History has shown that starting yield is usually a reliable indicator of what you can expect to earn over the next five years. This is because the majority of issuers that don&rsquo;t default typically call their bonds before they mature&mdash;and pay an average premium to bondholders of 2%-3% for the privilege. That offsets losses suffered on bonds that do default, leaving investors to earn something close to their starting yield.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Investors still have to pick their bonds carefully. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Blindly buying the index with a passive exchange-traded fund, for example, is highly risky. That&rsquo;s because it exposes you to CCC-rated junk bonds from highly levered companies that are most likely to default&mdash;many in embattled commodity-sensitive sectors. During the European debt crisis of 2011, and after the 2013 &ldquo;taper tantrum,&rdquo; investors who blindly bought risk ended up doing well.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not the case this time. We&rsquo;re at a later stage in the credit cycle, and investors who loaded up on CCCs over the last 12&ndash;18 months, hoping to boost returns, are nursing sizable losses today. CCCs were down more than 12% in 2015, compared to 1% for BB-rated bonds and 4.7% for B-rated ones. We expect them to fall more in the months ahead.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to be selective among higher-quality securities, too&mdash;especially in the US high-yield market, which is in the  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/post/en/2016/01/why-it-pays-to-keep-an-eye-on-the-credit-cycle\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   later stages of the credit cycle  </a> </u> . This is why an active global and multi-sector approach is critical.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Adding high yield to an equity portfolio can provide equity-like returns with less risk.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The key to understanding this one boils down to how one thinks about high yield. Most investors consider it part of their fixed-income allocation. And because high yield is riskier than other types of bonds, investors tend to be wary of holding too much of it.</p><p> But in reality, high yield acts a lot more like stocks than it does other bonds&mdash;with one important difference: it&rsquo;s less volatile. When times are good, high yield doesn&rsquo;t go up as much as stocks. But it declines less in down markets (and recovers more quickly). That&rsquo;s why we think it makes sense to think of high yield as a complement to one&rsquo;s equity exposure rather than part of a bond allocation. Tactically rotating some equity exposure into high yield can provide  <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/post/en/2016/02/high-yield-and-stocks-a-perfect-fit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   valuable downside protection while maintaining equity-like returns  </a> </u> .</p><p> Making investment decisions in volatile markets isn&rsquo;t easy. Cutting through the noise can help. High yield is a resilient asset class, and there are opportunities out there for selective investors.</p><p> For more information, please visit us <a href=\"https://www.abglobal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> . </p><p> The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 16:41:08.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 16:41:08.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_4y9jqHN.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/tuning-out-the-white-noise-in-high-yield/\", \"post_id\": \"9678\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 16:41:08\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 16:41:08\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"tuning-out-the-white-noise-in-high-yield\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9677\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4647\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tuning-Out-the-White-Noise-in-High-Yield.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"876\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457467500,"author_id":16,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4478,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How To Manage Millennials Effectively","link":"how-to-manage-millennials-effectively","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Millennials are tech-savvy, collaborative and innovative. In the digital world, they are well-connected and resourceful.</h3><p> <br/> Those are the strengths that can be transformed into  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/understanding-millennials-and-the-opportunities-they-bring-to-the-workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   valuable business opportunities  </a> </u> . However, Millennials - like everybody else - have baggage. Some of their weaknesses might not be so desirable in the workplace. If you find it challenging to work with and to supervise Gen Y employees, you are not the minority in the managers&rsquo; world. Therefore, we put together some tips to help you overcome the challenges and make the best out of your Gen Y employees.</p><p> So, what are the weaknesses of Millennials? You might have heard loads of Gen Y rants, as they call it the ME ME ME GENERATION. It is however very important to be aware ofstereotypes. We try to avoid prejudices by looking deeper into what is behind certain weaknesses in Generation Y. Here is what we have found:</p><h3> Impatience</h3><p> <br/> Millennials are no experts at waiting. They are spoiled with fast internet connection, instant download, and real-time apps (not to mentioned drive-thru fast food).</p><p> Let me illustrate this point with a simple calculation. 4G networks enable a downloading speed of 100MB per second or more. A 20-minute HD video (e.g. the latest episode of The Big Bang Theory) is around 450MB. It is therefore possible for one to connect to his 4G network and have the video downloaded in 4.5 seconds. So, why should one wait for anything or anyone longer than a minute?</p><p> Millennials&rsquo; early life is made up with high-speed experiences. They then go to the office expecting more or less the same. However, 4G networks can fail to deliver the promised 100mbps speed due to the distance from the cell tower or the interference from walls and objects - the real-world things. Same things happen at the office. Factors that are out of Millennials&rsquo; control can affect the speed of getting things done. For example, when a colleague works from home with slow internet connection, he or she might not respond to a request as quickly as a Millennial expects.</p><p> It often comes across as Millennials are too impatient to consider the real world things. Many managers complain about the &ldquo;I want it now&rdquo; attitude among Millennials. Millennials themselves admit that they are impatient. As long as you sympathise with the root of it, you can however find ways to minimize the negative impact. We will talk about this a bit further down.</p><h3> Commitment-phobia</h3><p> <br/> Millennials are widely thought as having a commitment issue. When HR managers talk about Millennials, it often goes like this: They don&rsquo;t stay in a company for longer than 2 years. They change jobs more often than not. They are not loyal. You get them onboard. You spend two months training them for the skills you want. They leave you in three months. You have to start the painful recruiting process all over again. You hesitate when you see more applications from Millennials. You don&rsquo;t know if you should risk it again.</p><p> A big part of these rants is true. When you compare Millennials with the preceding generations, you can see a big difference. Baby boomers and Gen X tended to stay in the same company for a long time if not their whole life. The story has changed with Millennials. They focus more on their personal development. They want to be at a place where they can grow. If you don&rsquo;t give them the chance to grow, they will leave for a place that does. It sounds kind of logical, don&rsquo;t you think?</p><p> It is the fact that it has never been easier for employees to change job. The increasing transparency in the workplace (yes, I am talking about Glassdoor) means people know the opportunities they have and ones they can aim for. Millennials are very well-informed. They get instant notifications about ideal jobs, even ones across the globe. Moving abroad is so much easier for Millennials than it has been for their parents. That brings a lot more options. Millennials&rsquo; personality prompts them to take a risk in pursuing different career paths. The transparent and connected world they grew up in gives them the means to do so. I am surprised that they are not doing it more.</p><p> Gen Y job-hopping is undeniably a headache for employers. However it might help if companies start focusing on the reasons why Millennials leave them and work from there. More on this will follow later.</p><h3> Short attention span</h3><p> <br/> Attention span is the amount of concentrated time on a task without becoming distracted. Educators and psychologists agree that the ability to focus attention on a task is crucial for achieving one's goals.</p><p> Undoubtedly, Millennials have their attention span shortened by their desire to check their Facebook and Twitter all the time. Moreover, the internet provides Millennials with a lot of information. It is getting too much that their mind finds it hard to handle. The mind learns tomulti task and scan data instead of going deeply into things. In the long term, it affects the ability to learn the depth, and to stick with goals.</p><p> This is what modern technology does to the attention span of human beings as a whole. Generation Y is not the only group affected - we might see it worse in Generation Z. However, as they are making up the larger part in nowadays&rsquo; workplace, their ability to focus and achieve goals concern employers a great deal.</p><h3> Strong sense of entitlement</h3><p> <br/> The older generations often complain that Millennials feel entitled to undeserved promotions and praise. They want constant and instant compliments and gratitude. They ask for flexible working time. They rather work from home. They demand fewer hours and more work-life balance.</p><p> If you ask a Millennial, he or she would probably tell you a different version. Millennials value positive feedback, flexibility at work and a better balance in life. Generation X or Generation Y, who would not feel strongly motivated if they receive instant recognition after getting the work done?I know I would.</p><p> Employers might consider Millennials&rsquo; sense of entitlement a weakness. The way employers react the the entitlement is however more important. If you decide that Millennials do not deserve what they want, there is not much else one can do about it. But if you can see the rationale for their values, there are ways to meet their expectations and benefit your business at the same time.</p><h3> How to overcome the challenges in managing Millennials</h3><p> <br/> Undoubtedly, Gen Y weaknesses pose challenges to their employers. To name a few: Millennials&rsquo; short attention span affects the ability to achieve the company&rsquo;s common goals. Their lack of commitment makes the recruitment a seemingly-never-ending loop. Besides, their impatience and strong sense of entitlement causes resentment among colleagues from older generations.</p><p> However, you can see from above that all their weaknesses come from their high expectations and their differentiated attitude towards the established way in the office. Therefore, you can make changes in the working environment and in your own management style to meet their expectations and match their values. Of course, it is only if you want to engage your Millennials and take the opportunities they bring.</p><h3> Working environment</h3><p> <br/> Gen Y employees don&rsquo;t like to wait. Don&rsquo;t let them wait for some knackered old computer systems to work. Upgrade your system. It will be good for the overall productivity anyway.</p><p> You should think about the totality of investment in the workplace&rsquo;s technology. Do not just get powerful computers and good software for once and for all. Adopt the mindset to embrace technology as it advances. If you think you can install an automation system and leave it be for another ten years, you are not doing it right. Technology changes fast these days. Adjust your budget accordingly. It is for sure thatyou will struggle to engage young people with old technology.</p><p> Moreover, you should consider the bigger picture, beyond technology. Think about culture. Build a culture that reflects what Millennials value: constant feedback, transparency, flexibility, and work-life balance. A strong culture is a powerful factor to engage the youngsters. Building a culture doesn&rsquo;t cost a fortune, either. All you need is to adopt the right mindset and to change certain behaviors. For example, Millennials want constant praise because that was what their parents did to them when they grew up. Fair enough. The question is what you do as their managers. You don&rsquo;t want to keep spoiling them but you should see the value of praise regarding motivation. Here are some specific tips:</p><li> <strong>  Make giving feedback a part of your culture. </strong> Form a habit of giving feedback as soon as your employees achieve something. Ask for their feedback on your managerial tasks. Encourage 360 degree feedback in the team.</li><li> <strong>  Think positively. </strong> Praising is much more than &ldquo;spoiling the already spoiled kids&rdquo;. It is only fair that managers show their appreciation towards one&rsquo;s hard work with a timely compliment. The earlier you recognize one&rsquo;s achievement, the more motivational it is for him or her. If you see otherwise room for improvement, tell your employees constructively. The fact Millennials like praise doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean that they hate constructive feedback. Remember that they highly focus on personal development. If you master the art of giving constructive feedback, your Gen Y&rsquo;s employees would definitely like to hear it. (Click  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/how-to-give-constructive-feedback-your-people-want-to-hear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  if you want to read more about giving constructive feedback) <br/>  </li><h3> Your management style</h3><p> <br/> You want to motivate your Gen Y employees instead of managing and supervising them. You want to be a role model, a coach and a friend. Here is how you can do it:</p><h3> Help them learn</h3><p> <br/> Allow them the time to learn new skills. Do not always expect a new Gen Y employee to have mastered the skills required for the job you give him. If he has, there is a high chance that he is looking for a new job where he can learn other skills.</p><p> Provide them the resources they need to learn. Pay subscription fees for digital libraries and appropriate tools. Give them advice on skill-related courses that they can register. Connect them with experts in their field.</p><p> Help them position themselves for the next step. Millennials want constant growth. Suggest paths for them to grow into. Provide mentorship through constructive feedback. Let them know about the skills they have mastered and what they can aim for with such skills. Help them recognise room to grow even more through positive feedback. Whatever you do, show them your confidence in them.</p><h3> Be approachable</h3><p> <br/> Let it be known that you are open for their ideas. Remove physical obstacles for communication. Sharing an open office with your Gen Y employees is a good start. When your team is bigger than 50, you probably need a separate office though. When you do, make sure that your door is open more often than it&rsquo;s closed. Most of the time, it helps to physically go to your employees and to ask how they are. Think of having 1-on-1s very regularly or encourage them among your management team. I once worked in a big corporate with more than 300 employees. One day during my first week, the CEO came to my corner in the marketing office. She wanted to say hello because she was away on the day I started my job. She gave me her business card and asked me to send her an email whenever I had an idea for improvement oranything else. I always think it was a nice touch. You can call it being approachable in a digital world.</p><h3> Be a role model</h3><p> <br/> Last but not least, walk the walk, do not just talk the talk. Millennials are known for their civic mind and their liberal attitude towards authority and hierarchy. Forcing authority on them won&rsquo;t keep them engaged, not for the long term at least. A better approach is to become their mentor, their friend and their role model.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> <br/> Millennials have their weaknesses. Their attention span is short. So is their patience. They are not the best at committing themselves to the company&rsquo;s long-term growth and somehow they feel entitled. Consequently, they are very challenging to work with and to manage. However, there are things you can do to overcome those challenges. You can use our tips as your coping mechanism because you can&rsquo;t no longer avoid working with Millennials - they are everywhere. But what we want more is for you to take the opportunities they bring and minimize their weaknesses the best you can. Then, you will make the best of both worlds.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 18:38:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 18:38:03.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_ebgVpJ6.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-manage-millennials-effectively/\", \"post_id\": \"9680\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 18:38:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 18:38:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-manage-millennials-effectively\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9679\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4648\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-To-Manage-Millennials-Effectively.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1397\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457535600,"author_id":450,"chart_url":""}

Although you may not have heard of it, it is possible that the eatery will become infamous as an example of how NOT to respond to customer feedback. When an organisation considers its strategic approach to Customer Experience, it is important it accepts that &lsquo;perfection&rsquo; is not realistic. All businesses will get things wrong &ndash; it is inevitable. Customers are now free and able to tell the world when they feel you have got it wrong. It is how you deal with things when they do go wrong that can often be the difference between the best exponents of customer centric behaviour&hellip;.. and the worst!</p><p> So let me fill you in on the 47 King Street Story. In 2013, the restaurant was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by TripAdvisor. At the time of writing this blog post, it still has a &lsquo;four star&rsquo; rating on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187069-d2510128-Reviews-47_King_Street_West_Restaurant_Bar_Tea_Rooms-Manchester_Greater_Manchester_Englan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   TripAdvisor site  </a> </u> &hellip;&hellip; whether or not it will still have this rating by the time I finish writing this post is a different matter!! To all intense and purposes, 47 King Street appears to be a restaurant that could quite comfortably feature on your list of places to eat in the North West of England.</p><p> However, closer inspection of TripAdvisor reveals that all might not be as well as it seems. You only have to scroll down to the review posted on the 28th February 2015 &ndash; it does not make good reading (for the restaurant that is):</p><br /><p> If you were the owner of this establishment, you would quite rightly be horrified to read this brutally honest feedback from a customer &ndash; a customer who had no doubt spent a significant sum of money in your restaurant. You would also appreciate that it in 2015, any customer has the ability to share their experience with millions of others at the click of a mouse.</p><p> Anyone reading this review has a choice &ndash; a choice to believe everything contained within it, or to look at the balance of all reviews and form a rounded opinion of the restaurant. One would expect that when a negative review of this nature has been posted online that the company concerned would leave a suitable response to clarify the situation &ndash; whether the customer was right or wrong. At the end of the day, the internet is now as much of your shop window as your physical premises are.</p><p> In the case of 47 King Street West, the manager of the restaurant DID respond to this review&hellip;&hellip;just not in the way you may expect. Although his comments have been removed from their social media streams, here is his unedited response posted on Facebook:</p><br /><p> Describing customers as &lsquo;the chaviest worst most vile people ever to grace our restaurant&rsquo; is perhaps not the best response to their feedback. To dish out a tirade of abuse dismissing those customers as &lsquo;trash&rsquo; is almost unbelievable. To  do it so publicly is remarkably naive. The problem with the way that 47 King Street responded is that other potential customers are now likely to base their opinion of the restaurant on his behaviour &ndash; even if his customers were wrong, you just cannot do what Mike Hymanson, the owner of 47 King Street has done.</p><p> The visibility of this story is only just picking up pace &ndash; how viral it will become is yet to be seen. Mr Hymanson has now described the incident as regrettable (not surprising really!) &ndash; it is not clear whether he has directly apologised to the poor customer concerned. You can read more about the incident  <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/chav-cheap-trash-restaurant-boss-5266827\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  here </a> .</p><p> Learning how to deal with customers who you perceive to be wrong is vitally important in maintaining the credibility of your brand and the experience it is intending to deliver. In the same way that you do not want to do something to affect your personal credibility in the future, it is just as important to not &lsquo;retaliate&rsquo; in a way that makes the situation worse.</p><p> Only yesterday, on an Easyjet flight from Athens to London Gatwick, I witnessed what I saw as completely unacceptable behaviour from a customer. There is no doubt in my mind that I was observing a scenario where the customer was undeniably wrong. The customer was not particularly pleasant from the moment she got on the plane. Carrying her baby daughter, she seemed to expect that the seat next to her should be vacant. The bemused passenger sat in the seat kept her cool remarkably well. The excellent cabin crew managed the situation brilliantly and were able to move the bemused passenger to another seat.</p><p> Sensing all was well, I sat back and prepared myself for a restful flight. Shortly after take off, with the fasten seat belt sign still lit, the &lsquo;unpleasant&rsquo; passenger unbuckled her belt and vacated her seat to get something from the overhead luggage rack. A member of the cabin crew walked down the aisle and asked her very politely to remain seated until the &lsquo;fasten seat belt sign&rsquo; was switched off. A perfectly reasonable request I am sure you will agree. The passenger responded with a torrent of very strong words including &ndash; &lsquo;leave me alone&rsquo;; &lsquo;I am pregnant and you are going to make me miscarry&rsquo;; &lsquo;why do you treat passengers like this?&rsquo;</p><p> It was really quite unbelievable. The cabin crew members response was in my view the perfect example of how to respond. She replied in a steady, polite, and confident manner &ndash; &lsquo;I understand madam&rsquo;. &lsquo;Please take your seat as quickly as you feel comfortable&rsquo;. Although quite clearly shaken, the Easyjet employee did exactly the right thing. She did not retaliate. She did not quote policy or procedure that would most likely rile the passenger even more. She quietly left the customer to it.</p><p> Now imagine what COULD have happened if she had responded in a different way? What COULD have happened if she demanded that the passenger be seated (as I am sure she had every right to do)? It is perfectly feasible that this lady could have resorted to social media to say how a pregnant lady travelling with a baby was mistreated by Easyjet cabin crew.  It COULD have gone viral, and got in front of the eyes of journalists. Instead, a potentially damaging situation will never be heard of again. In fact the actions of this excellent ambassador for Easyjet almost certainly won her the admiration of other passengers on the plane, thus enhancing the reputation of her company.</p><p> Customers will not always be right. Customers who are not right are able to share their thoughts with the world. As the owner of a business, whether you think they are right or they are wrong, it is absolutely critical that you deal with their feedback in a way that does not detrimentally and potentially fatally damage your business. The end to end journey for many consumers now starts with the assessment of feedback found online &ndash; the last thing you want is for them to see the public face of your organisation publicly abusing customers who leave what appears to be honest feedback.</p><p> The phrase &lsquo;feedback is a gift&rsquo; is often an overused term. I personally believe it is and always will be the perfect phrase for describing feedback. Like all gifts, handle it with care!</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 19:03:35.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 19:03:35.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_Ksz2wVZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-customer-is-not-always-right-but-tread-carefully/\", \"post_id\": \"9684\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 19:03:35\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 19:03:35\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-customer-is-not-always-right-but-tread-carefully\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9683\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4650\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Be-Careful-How-You-Respond-When-the-Customer-Is-Not-Right.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"786\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457539200,"author_id":200,"chart_url":""}

{"original_id":4482,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How Employee Turnover Impacts the Bottom Line (and How to Improve it)","link":"how-employee-turnover-impacts-the-bottom-line-and-how-to-improve-it","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> How does sales force turnover impact the balance sheet? Here's a long, hard look at the relationship between effective performance management and successful sales operations. <br/>  </h3><p> The war for talent is becoming an increasingly hot topic of discussion in the sales world. And for good reason.</p><p> Many sales teams -- especially those with an inside sales focus -- are taking on legions of new Millennials, often straight out of college. And as found by  <u>  <a href=\"http://strategicrevenuepartners.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Strategic Revenue Partners  </a> </u> , the turnover rate of sales staff, measured across multiple industries, amounts to 87% over a four-year period.</p><p> More disconcertingly, and as sales and HR leaders are all too well aware, the costs associated with onboarding, engaging and retaining sales personnel is growing higher and higher.</p><h3> How Sales Turnover Impacts Bottom Lines <br/>  </h3><p> From an overarching standpoint, experts estimate direct costs of turning over one sales rep (lost productivity, time spent hiring, training and orientating a new rep alongside customer loss) to be around \"150% of the annual salary or 200% of the annual salary if the position is vacant for more than 90 days.\"</p><p> The purpose of this post is to discuss the actual costs of sales turnover and assess ways that you can minimize balance sheet costs associated with unwanted personnel changes.</p><p> We'll do so by breaking costs down into individual chunks, starting with the costs of actual hiring and onboarding a new sales rep. </p><h3> Hiring and Onboarding <br/>  </h3><p> According to Strategic Revenue Partners, \"the time associated with hiring a new sales person is upwards of 100 hours,\" taking into account \"sourcing candidates, resume review, interviews, reference checks &amp; administrative support.\"</p><p> Once the new hire joins the sales force, he or she can be expected to contribute somewhere \"between 25% and 50% of the standard productivity level for the first 12 weeks.\" </p><p> Consequently, the first steps to minimizing new hire costs is to discern your company's average ramp time and figure out a playbook for minimizing that ramp time.</p><p> For one example, the Harvard Business Review found in \" <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2006/09/the-new-science-of-sales-force-productivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The New Science of Sales Force Productivity  </a> </u> \" that SAP was able to analyze \"how long it takes for new reps to become productive [...] how their productivity increases after that [and] determine the average productivity rate for seasoned reps.\"</p><p> Doing so had a beneficial impact in several ways.</p><p> First, it helped managers \"staff their segment territory plan more effectively.\" Second, it helps them know more quickly when a new hire isn&rsquo;t meeting the standard.</p><p> As noted by SAP CEO Bill McDermott in the article, \"People generally reach[ed] their productivity plateau at 12 months. If they are not there, they are not going to get there. And that&rsquo;s about 10% of our new hires.&rdquo;</p><p> To improve new hire onboarding and ramp time, sales leaders should also have codified, automated performance expectations put in place.</p><p> As found by the  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-top-sales-teams-have-in-common-in-5-charts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u> , top-performing sales teams minimize onboarding costs by codifying, tracking and enforcing their sales process better than anyone else. Doing so is the quickest way to ramp new hires up to full productivity.</p><h3> Engagement and Retention <br/>  </h3><p> Engagement and retention is the equally vital flip side of the sales turnover coin. Just as you need to hire and ramp up sales personnel as efficiently as possible, you must ensure that your existing personnel are fully engaged and feel encouraged to remain loyal to your company.</p><p> From an engagement standpoint, a 2014 Employee Engagement survey from TINYpulse has some actionable, surprising insights on how to cultivate an engaging work environment.</p><p> According to their report, \"peers, not money, are the number one reason why workers go the extra mile,\" as 70% of employees \"credited their peers for creating an engaging environment, while perks such as work functions, parties, or amenities only accounted for 8%.\"</p><p> Peer recognition, it turns out, is also something that may be more easily achieved than initially thought.</p><p> As found in the report, &ldquo;employees want to recognize their peers. When someone feels valued, they&rsquo;re more likely to rate their colleague with a higher score.&rdquo; </p><p> Turning to retention, experts have found that engagement goes hand-in-hand with both employee recognition and retention.</p><p> \"Retention is tied to recognition &ndash; yet a significant majority of employees (79%) &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel strongly valued for the work they put in.&rdquo; </p><p> And aside from peer recognition, the experts at HBR find the best forms of recognition -- that also impact retention -- are data-driven. </p><p> As stated in the \"New Science of Sales Force Productivity\" article, \"[t]he key to retention is to set people up to succeed.

Anthony Iannarino  </a> </u> | <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Sales Blog  </a> </u></p><p> I grew up in a business that was much smaller than the major competitors with whom we battled for business. I learned to sell by competing with competitors with revenue thousands of times greater than my company for the largest prospects in my territory. Rarely did I have to compete against a company of equal or smaller revenue.</p><p> Here is a pattern I picked up that&rsquo;s worth sharing.</p><h3> <strong>  The Safer Choice </strong></h3><p> <br/> They used to say &ldquo;Nobody got fired for hiring IBM.&rdquo; Maybe they still say this.</p><p> It is easy for companies to choose a large, well-established company as their partner. You don&rsquo;t get to be a large corporation without building the processes and systems that allow you to do good work. A large company appears to be safer because many others have chosen them as a partner, they have great resources, and they seem to be less of a risk when it comes to execution.</p><p> The first time through a real buying process a lot of big businesses choose other large companies as their partners. And so do a lot of smaller companies.</p><h3> <strong>  It&rsquo;s Not Us, It&rsquo;s Them </strong></h3><p> <br/> When the larger company doesn&rsquo;t produce the expected results, it&rsquo;s very easy for the customer to believe that the larger company is to blame. In many cases this is true. Those same processes and systems that allow a large business to scale also make it tough for them to customize their approach to individual clients or customers. This is where bigger companies begin to have some challenges.</p><p> By not being able to customize their solution or give attention to some of their many customers, larger companies end up creating enough dissatisfaction that they open themselves up to the threat of being competitively displaced. That sounds like an excellent opportunity, but much of the time, the buying company isn&rsquo;t quite ready to let go of the safer choice. So they choose another larger company as their partner, believing that switching partners will change the result.</p><h3> <strong>  Ready for Real Change </strong></h3><p> <br/> After a couple of rounds with larger companies as partners, many companies are ready for real change. They find out that the solution they want is going to require a partner who is willing and able to customize a solution specifically tailored to them and their business. This is when  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/2011/03/14/the-third-time-is-a-charm%e2%80%94being-honest-with-your-dream-client/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the playing field is leveled  </a> </u>  and smaller competitors who have done their homework have a chance to win.</p><p> You have to start nurturing your dream clients now to ensure you get an opportunity to compete. This is how you punch above your weight class.</p><h3> <strong>  The Long Game </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first time you compete, win or lose, you get to meet the people who make decisions. You also get a chance to start building your case.</p><p> The second time you compete, you get an opportunity to deepen the relationship and show your dream client how your ability to tailor your solution will give them what they want.</p><p> The third time you compete, if you&rsquo;ve nurtured relationships, you massively increase your odds of winning because you are  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/2014/11/19/known-liked-and-trusted-a-revision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   known  </a> </u>  and because your dream client is continually disappointed with the results larger companies fail to provide.</p><li> What are you doing to future relationships in your dream client accounts so that you can make yourself known and obtain an opportunity to compete?</li><li> How do you stay engaged with your dream clients during the periods where they are working with your competitors so that you have successfully made your case when they are dissatisfied enough to move to a smaller company?</li>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 19:30:12.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 19:30:12.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_tDajVuV.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-beat-your-larger-competitors/\", \"post_id\": \"9691\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 19:30:12\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 19:30:12\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-beat-your-larger-competitors\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9690\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4653\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-To-Beat-Your-Larger-Competitors.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"619\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457554500,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4484,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Does It Matter What Kind of Investor Your Client Is?","link":"does-it-matter-what-kind-of-investor-your-client-is","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> I ask prospective clients the following two questions:</h3>If the stock market was up 12% in a year what would you expect the return on your portfolio to be? If the stock market was down 12% in a year what would you expect the loss on your portfolio to be?<h3> The question is general enough to get them thinking.</h3><strong> The answers are often surprising.</strong>First, a disclaimer: There is a right answer. Yes, you read that correctly; I did not say that there is no right answer. There is no right answer in the fields of comparative literature, eastern spirituality, or modern art, but in the investment world there are right answers and wrong answers. I will give you the right answers and wrong answers.There are two possible responses to each question: you expect your portfolio return to be more than (&gt;) 12%, or less than (&lt;) 12% in an up market, and you expect your portfolio return to be more than (&gt;) -12%, or less than (&lt;) -12% in a down market. (I could have picked 10, 11, or 13%--nothing fixed about the 12% number, but I wanted it to be slightly higher than average returns to stimulate thinking).<h3> The four types of investors:</h3><li> <strong>  Speculator </strong></li><li> <strong>  Dreamer </strong></li><li> <strong>  Amateur </strong></li><li> <strong>  Contrarian </strong></li><h3> <strong>  Speculator </strong></h3>Q: If the stock market was up 12% in a given year what would you expect the return on your portfolio to be?A: &gt; 12%Q: If the stock market was down 12% in a given year what would you expect the loss on your portfolio to be?A: &lt; -12%This is not an unrealistic response. Speculators expect more return when the market goes up and more loss when the market drops. Professional speculators, venture capital, private equity, might fit this category. However, the way that a professional speculator makes money is by having a strict sell discipline in a down market (or by being in so many deals that the rare supernova investment eclipses the numerous asteroids). A strict sell discipline, is what separates the professional from the accidental.I don&rsquo;t think that the non-professional investor has the time, tools or skills to monitor the risk of his portfolio to be an effective speculator. Note that I said effective speculator. We all know the ineffective speculators who simply want to beat an up market but are completely uninformed about down markets&mdash;day traders, IPO buyers, penny stock buyers, etc. Maybe you have known this person. Maybe you once were this person.Paul Tudor Jones is one of the great speculators of our time. Jones is primarily a commodities investor originally from Memphis, TN. I met him in Atlanta years ago near the beginning of his career when he created a futures fund for Merrill Lynch. In 1987 he reportedly made between $80 and $100 million&mdash;more than anyone else on the street. He currently has a net worth over $4 billion. What philosophy guides him? &ldquo;I'd say that my investment philosophy is that I don't take a lot of risk&hellip; at the end of the day, the most important thing is how good are you at risk control. Ninety-percent of any great trader is going to be the risk control.&rdquo;[i]<h3> <strong>  Dreamer </strong></h3>Q: If the stock market was up 12% in a given year what would you expect the return on your portfolio to be?A: &gt; 12%Q: If the stock market was down 12% in a given year what would you expect the loss on your portfolio to be?A: &gt; -12%This answer is illogical and is the most dangerous investment philosophy to hold. Investment strategies that short-term outperform the market on the upside tend to be aggressive in nature, or employ leveraging techniques such as buying on margin or options. Such strategies have the opposite effect in a down market and multiply losses. Now, a clever money manager might say that he employs aggressive strategies in up markets and conservative strategies in down markets, and that is how he plans on achieving superior returns in either market.The problem is that we never know in advance whether we are in a good market or a bad market. For example, the market debacle from 2007-2009 which befell sub-prime bond investors. They didn&rsquo;t know that they were in a bad market until a few days before they folded their business and took multi-billion-dollar write downs. &ldquo;On Oct. 1 the bank disclosed that it was writing down $3.4 billion in losses largely due to ill-considered bets on the U.S. subprime market&hellip;UBS held $19 billion in subprime residential mortgage-backed securities-90% or more of it rated AAA.&rdquo;[ii] UBS, obviously, did not know what kind of a market they were in.The investor who expects to outperform in an up market and a down market will be disappointed and eventually divest. Even professional money managers who would describe themselves as aggressive would not expect these kinds of returns nor promise them. Of all of the choices this is the most highly suspicious.<h3> <strong>  Amateur </strong></h3>Q: If the stock market was up 12% in a given year what would you expect the return on your portfolio to be?A: &lt; 12%Q: If the stock market was down 12% in a given year what would you expect the loss on your portfolio to be?A: &lt; -12%This investor expects lower than market returns in good years and bad years. Most studies (Dalbar, Inc. among the best resources) would indicate that this is what average investors accomplish. They don&rsquo;t capture all of the upside but they lose more than the market in bad years. This was witnessed in the internet bubble and in any period of market excess when investors get into the market too late, thus never receiving any long-term benefit and exiting only after significant (I&rsquo;m never going to do that again) losses. This is a wrong answer. If you really feel this way, you might be acting out of fear. If your fear is this great you may not be suitable to be a stock investor.<h3> <strong>  Contrarian </strong></h3>Q: If the stock market was up 12% in a given year what would you expect the return on your portfolio to be?A: &lt; 12%Q: If the stock market was down 12% in a given year what would you expect the losses on your portfolio to be?A: &gt; -12%I believe this is the best answer for the non-professional long-term investor, and the most realistic route to positive returns. This investor realizes that the key to long-term wealth accumulation in the stock market is protection in down markets, thus he gives up some on the upside but protects on the downside.Hedge-fund managers, whom some consider the savviest of professional money managers, would fit in this category. Brian Portnoy, Ph.D., CFA wrote, &ldquo;(M)ost hedge fund managers use hedging techniques, many of them will underperform in up markets and outperform in down markets. This speaks to a lower risk profile, not higher.&rdquo;[iii]<h3> Why does this work? Math.</h3>The numbers always work against you. How do the numbers work against you? Call it investment gravity. Remember, if you lose 50% in one year how much do you need to make in the next year to break even? 100%--twice as much. You need to absorb that and see how you can have investment gravity work for you. That is, realize that if you can only protect yourself during the down markets your total return will be higher than the person who did not protect himself.There actually is a fifth answer to the question. Whether the market goes up or down 12% you expect your returns to be neither greater than the market nor less than the market. You simply expect whatever the market returns. This answer would come from the committed index fund investor, and certainly a legitimate way to invest as over $2 trillion in exchange traded funds (ETF) and index funds attests. I hope that you can see the advantage of knowing your client in this very important way. It is also vital that you know yourself as an advisor. If you are a contrarian do you think it would be a good idea for you to manage speculative portfolios?<u> [i] Ramin, Joel, &ldquo;Interview with Paul Tudor Jones II (Abridged),&rdquo; http://chinese-school.netfirms.com/Paul-Tudor-Jones-interview.html, 1/13/00.</u>[ii] Reed, Stanley, &ldquo;UBS Gets Whacked by Subprime Mess,&rdquo; Business Week, http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-10-01/ubs-gets-whacked-by-subprime-messbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice.[iii] Portnoy, Ph.D., CFA, &ldquo;The Investor's Paradox: The Power of Simplicity in a World of Overwhelming Choice,&rdquo; New York: Palgrave Macmillan Trade, 2014.

{"original_id":4486,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Overcoming the Fear of Change in the Workplace","link":"overcoming-the-fear-of-change-in-the-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time; what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better.&rdquo; &mdash;Sydney J. Harris </strong></p><p> I love the above quote from Sydney Harris; what an oxymoron, we want things to get better but we don&rsquo;t want anything to change. This applies in both our personal lives and in the workplace. As leaders, our fear of change is compounded in the workplace. We have learned to control people and things the way they are but, what will happen if things change? Will we lose control? Or, might we get left behind? Does the need to change mean we were wrong in the first place? How will change impact our progress? So, how can we overcome the fear of change in the workplace?</p><h3> This is the way we&rsquo;ve always done it</h3><p> <br/> We have to start with doing away with the mindset that &ldquo;this is the way we&rsquo;ve always done it, so this is the way we&rsquo;re going to do it.&rdquo; There is no guarantee that what has worked for us in the past will continue to work for us in the future. In fact, quite the opposite is true. If we don&rsquo;t challenge the status quo we will not be prepared to meet the demands we will encounter in the future. You must develop the courage to reexamine the situation and reevaluate your thinking. Are your decisions influenced by your biases? How can you be prepared to confront the unexpected and seize new opportunities if you do not encourage and embrace the change and innovation necessary to stay ahead of the pack?</p><h3> You fear the unknown</h3><p> <br/> Change forces you to step out of your comfort zone; it exposes you to a new world and new experiences. We fear that change is unpredictable and the thought of the unknown can be terrifying. While facing the unknown requires taking on a certain amount of risk, it is also a great way to build confidence and open yourself up to a whole new perspective and a world of new opportunities. To overcome the fear of change in the workplace, learn to embrace the opportunities that await you on the other side of uncertainty.</p><h3> You think you know everything</h3><p> <br/> When you think you know everything you are going to fear change. Effective change requires the participation of employees throughout your organization. And guess what, you are going to find that some of them know things that you don&rsquo;t. No one knows everything, not even you. That&rsquo;s where shared responsibility and cooperation comes into play. Successful organizations capitalize on the individual strengths and knowledge of their employees. To overcome the fear of change in the workplace, learn to accept the fact that you do not, nor should you, know everything.</p><h3> You don&rsquo;t trust your employees</h3><p> <br/> In order to overcome the fear of change in the workplace, you must hire the right people, give them the training they need, and then let them do their jobs. When you don&rsquo;t trust your employees, you will fear change. You will question their ability to make the decisions and take the actions necessary to implement change effectively without disrupting business operations. Encourage an attitude of teamwork and set the example by developing trusting relationships with your employees.</p><h3> You will lose control</h3><p> <br/> As a leader, your biggest fear is that you will lose control. This fear is magnified whenever change is involved. This fear rolls the fear of the unknown, thinking that you know everything, and lack of trust in your employees into a demon that will kill any effort at change, innovation, and progress. If you fear the loss of control you probably have a micromanagement problem. Employees need to feel competent and in control of their own work. Micromanagement and excessive control undermines relationships, trust, engagement, performance, and loyalty. To overcome the fear of change in the workplace, focus on helping your teams work well together and make sure employees are engaged and feel valued instead of fearing that you will lose control.</p><h3> Overcome the Fear of Change</h3><p> <br/> Things cannot get better yet remain the same. Change is a necessity; we must change or we become obsolete. As a leader, you must learn to be comfortable questioning the status quo. Then, you must embrace the change that is required to achieve success today, tomorrow, and into the future.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 21:55:09.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 21:55:09.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_7K7BUTy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/overcoming-the-fear-of-change-in-the-workplace/\", \"post_id\": \"9696\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 21:55:09\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 21:55:09\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"overcoming-the-fear-of-change-in-the-workplace\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9695\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4656\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Overcoming-the-Fear-of-Change-in-the-Workplace.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1331\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457546400,"author_id":164,"chart_url":""}

For the last few weeks (which means much longer), I&rsquo;ve battled through each day.</h3><p> <br/> As wonderful as my life is, I struggle just like you do. No one escapes the occasional rough patch here and there.</p><p> Some stretches seem catastrophic. Others, like my current one, appear to invade multiple aspects of my life no matter how healthy, vibrant, successful, or perfect any of them seem at a given moment.</p><p> My swimming strokes don&rsquo;t have that usual effortless cadence. For some strange reason, I&rsquo;ve been too-frequently bumping my bad elbow on the wall corners in my home. I&rsquo;ve become overwhelmed by the important and unimportant to-dos on my desk. Worst of all, I haven&rsquo;t been catching those breaks that typically make an appearance with some level of frequency.</p><p> Instead of fighting these bad vibrations and unforced errors, I thought I&rsquo;d embrace them.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve heard singers and songwriters share stories regarding how they produce their best songs when they channel their pain. Well, I can&rsquo;t carry a tune to save my life, but I can write.</p><p> I thought why not just go with that? What are some of the greatest, most painful mistakes I&rsquo;ve ever made?</p><p> Here are a few of my self-inflicted doozies&mdash;the ones you simply can&rsquo;t simulate from someone else&rsquo;s translation. I&rsquo;ve titled it 7 Great &ldquo;Mistakes&rdquo; You Need to Make for Yourself. Feel free to hurry up and make them. The sooner you do, the more time you&rsquo;ll have to enjoy life!</p><h3> Is &lsquo;trust&rsquo; a four or five letter word?</h3><p> <br/> Trust someone&rsquo;s opinion other than your own. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve forgotten every time you trusted someone else&rsquo;s alternate opinion only to discover you were correct. Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll have better fortune if you&rsquo;re committed to your own thoughts and direction even if you&rsquo;re headed in the wrong direction. It&rsquo;s a metaphysical law.</p><p> This quote from  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_Park\" target=\"_blank\">   Mansfield Park by Jane Austen  </a> </u>  comes to mind. &ldquo;We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person can be.&rdquo;</p><h3> Pick-up game anyone?</h3><p> <br/> Fail miserably. Fail in such horrific fashion there&rsquo;ll be no mistaking you should ever try it again. When embraced, the humiliation will become purifying and liberating.</p><p> The slice of humble pie should be so large and awful it drives you straight to what you were born to do. Think Michael Jordan trying-to-play-baseball awful:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=dfd224a8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   127 Games, .202 Batting Average, 114 Strike Outs, and 11 Errors.  </a> </u></p><p> This eye-cringing effort drove His Airness right back to the basketball court where he belonged. He was so upset he launched Da Bulls to three more championships after he returned!</p><h3> Did someone say this was hard?</h3><p> <br/> Become successful with little effort. While you&rsquo;re easily succeeding, this won&rsquo;t appear a mistake. When examined in its wake, however, you&rsquo;ll understand only time reveals what&rsquo;s good or bad.</p><p> Anything that comes too easily oftentimes results in one of two outcomes. It disappears as quickly as it occurred. The alternative is you disregard it because it came so easily. You haven&rsquo;t sacrificed enough effort to care.</p><p> Think about that free gift you don&rsquo;t value nearly as much as something for which you paid $100.</p><p> I love the  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/25265-continuous-effort---not-strength-or-intelligence---is-the\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Winston Churchill quote </a> , &ldquo;Continuous effort&mdash;not strength or intelligence&mdash;is the key to unlocking your potential.&rdquo;</p><h3> Money can&rsquo;t buy me love so who cares?</h3><p> <br/> Waste Money. I&rsquo;m not talking about getting nipped with ATM bank fees or eating out too often. I am referring to the I-should&rsquo;ve-just-lit-the-money-on-fire moments.</p><p> Last year, my wife and I were in a car dealership when a woman walked in. She wanted to return the (brand) new car she purchased a few weeks earlier because her husband was upset. Turns out she bought the same model he has and managed to choose the same color as well. (I&rsquo;m not clever enough to make this stuff up.)</p><p> The dealer wanted to clip her for a few thousand dollars because she drove it out of the showroom.</p><p> Can&rsquo;t wait for the kids to refresh Mom&rsquo;s memory of this story next time she tells them leaving their green beans untouched is wasteful. Value your hard-earned money.</p><h3> I never saw a deadline I didn&rsquo;t like.</h3><p> <br/> Work too much. By &ldquo;too much&rdquo; I mean you were so exhausted you fell asleep at your desk. It took an hour for the imprints to dissipate from your cheek thanks to face plant you did on your keyboard. You will never understand balance unless you&rsquo;ve been out of balance.</p><p> My passion is my mission. Success is more like, uh, an intermission.</p><p> Focus on success rather than your purpose. You&rsquo;re good at it. Maybe you&rsquo;re even great at it. Your profession more than pays the bills. You&rsquo;ve become accustomed to a lifestyle thanks to a career you don&rsquo;t love.</p><p> You keep going through the motions even though your body feels like a shell with no soul. Sad.</p><p> You&rsquo;re never as trapped as you think you are. A life lived with purpose trumps dollars any day.

{"original_id":4488,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Treating Your Employees as Your Customers Will Create Success","link":"why-treating-your-employees-as-your-customers-will-create-success","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When we think of our (potential) customers, especially about how we want to reach them, we right away start to think on marketing level. We contemplate about how we can steer our identity in a way it can influence our image and our reputation positively. We have ideas about our brand: who are we, who we want to be and how we want people to perceive us. We directly connect this with the changes our company culture needs, so it can help us shape the company we wished for. A distinct marketing plan will put all sorts of processes in motion that creates all this. Or at least, we aim for it. Now visualise replacing customers for employees in this situation.</p><p> Did you notice your mind shifting in another gear in just a few seconds? Although it takes the right people to build the company that attracts the desired customers in the first place, it seems that our auto pilot thinks differently about &lsquo;recruiting&rsquo; customers than about the recruitment of employees. I don&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s exactly the same, but they do have an important common denominator: they can both become your ambassadors. Also, both groups of people are complementary to one another. It takes good employees with empathy and understanding of your customers&rsquo; journey to succeed in your customer approach. People are key in all the essentials that can build a solid and appealing company.</p><p> This brings me to the point of this article. In the past employers had an advantage on their employees when it comes to market information. Nowadays the labour market is transparant. Professionals know exactly what they are worth and what is negotiable. The market transparency has increased even more through online platforms. Look for instance at Glassdoor, where you can get a glance behind the scenes of vacancies and companies. Information about salaries, company reviews and interview questions in one search engine. This information is provided anonymously by employees and job seekers. En good example of data being available in a wink. Technology and innovation change recruitment more and more in a marketing process.</p><h3> Treat your employees as your customers <br/>  </h3><p> Have you ever defined why someone would want to work for you? Recruitment is a pull strategy. For employer branding departments great recruiters are the vital connection. On the one hand they know what brand and culture an organisation wants to build, on the other hand they understand what talents expect of their ultimate job or employer. Looking at the marketing process that comes with scouting and recruiting talents, recruiters are the detrimental factor in that process:</p><li> Know your target market</li><li> Develop your key message</li><li> Spread your message through multiple channels</li><li> It is always a continuous journey, find out what works <br/>  </li><p> Talent is a valuable asset that companies borrow, not have. After you have seduced skilled people to work for you, what&rsquo;s next? Well, how fast can you get from on boarding to creating ambassadors? Turning employees into ambassadors requires more than basic work floor principles. People need to be educated on your history, on what your business stands for and what your goals are. Just memorising is not enough. They basically need to &lsquo;feel&rsquo; the concept. Therefore it better be an inspiring background you are dishing up, so they share your vision! This requires high level internal marketing that is empowering your company&rsquo;s cultural behaviour. Building a culture not only means making changes happen, it also helps to create an environment people would really want to work in and engage to. What happens on the inside projects on the outside. Engaged and loyal employees (ambassadors) easily attract job seekers that develop that same connection with your company.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"604\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Treating-Your-Employees-as-Your-Customers.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p><h3> How are social media changing the game? <br/>  </h3><p> Digitisation, connectivity en accessibility. A gossip, story or photo can be shared with the whole world by pushing one button. So can a job vacancy or a job application. Social recruiting is therefore playing an important role in branding and recruitment. Being out there, being everywhere. Social media is an excellent way to get noticed. Not only by job seekers, also by potential talents who are not actively looking for a new job, but are open to a career change. If it&rsquo;s a suitable strategy to sell product to customers, why not for recruitment?</p><p> If you get noticed, you create opportunities. First, you can build and promote your employer brand. Second, you can position your company so that talents will think of you first when they are looking for a job, whether they are unemployed or are seeking for or career change. Third, you are able to show candidates and potential ambassadors what your company culture is all about. These days using social networks for recruiting is the smart thing to do, because you will reach candidates where they spend the majority of their time. Online. But let&rsquo;s be fair, this might be the easier part. Becoming an organisation talented people would like to work for is still your ultimate challenge that precedes the recruitment marketing strategy.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 22:21:49.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 22:21:49.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_F99taTl.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-treating-your-employees-as-your-customers-will-create-success/\", \"post_id\": \"9702\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 22:21:49\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 22:21:49\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-treating-your-employees-as-your-customers-will-create-success\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9700\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4658\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Why-Treating-Your-Employees-as-Your-Customers-Will-Change-Your-Business.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1081\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457532000,"author_id":45,"chart_url":""}

Bottom line, it is not even necessary.</p><p> Both Ellen and Sandy had the same design and marketing skills. They met in school where they were studying the same thing. They became close friends and had the same idea for a business. They worked so well together not just creating, but brainstorming new ideas and new ways to operationalize and market them.

One plus one is greater than the sum of two.</h3><p> <br/> Of course, a business, depending on its size needs the additional skills of handling technology, finances, manufacturing, equipment, employees, vendors, etc.</p><p> Usually even partners who have complementary skills still have some areas which none of them know how to do. They either take it upon themselves to learn or they hire others from the outside as employees or consultants, such as lawyers and accountants, sub-contractors, such as IT experts, designers, marketers and others to do the missing tasks.</p><p> Other common examples of business partners who share the same skill sets are lawyers, real estate agents, accountants, doctors, dentists, therapists, online technology companies and many others. In all of these situations, it becomes necessary to find people on the outside to hire as support staff or with whom to consult.

{"original_id":4491,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Benefits of Reducing Your Tax Refund","link":"the-benefits-of-reducing-your-tax-refund","source_link":null,"content":"<p> With  <u>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day\" target=\"_blank\">   tax day  </a> </u>  fast approaching, many people are counting on receiving a big check back from the Government. While you&rsquo;re probably looking forward to this windfall, there are reasons why you may wish to minimize your end-of-year refund.</p><h3> Why Big Refunds are Bad</h3><p> <br/> Taxes are refunded to you when the Government takes too much of your pay each pay period. By overpaying each paycheck, only to get the money returned to you once a year, you are essentially lending the Government money at zero percent interest.</p><p> This is money that could have been budgeted for and spent, or invested, throughout the year. Even if you had put the money in a savings account over the year, you still would be better off.</p><h3> How to Minimize Your Refund</h3><p> <br/> In order to adjust the amount that is withheld for the IRS each pay period you need to fill out/change your W-4 form.</p><p> The W-4 allows you to specify allowances or exemptions that you are eligible for.</p><p> These can include:</p><li> <strong>  Donations to charitable organizations </strong></li><li> <strong>  Interest on a home mortgage </strong></li><li> <strong>  Interest on student loan debt </strong></li><li> <strong>  Contributions to traditional IRAs </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The W-4 form estimates the amount that you would receive from a tax refund. This amount is then distributed over the number of weeks remaining in the tax year, lowering the amount withheld from your paycheck each pay period.</p><p> You should also look into filling out a new W-4 every time you have experienced a major change in your life. Examples of this include:</p><li> <strong>  Switching jobs </strong></li><li> <strong>  Marriage </strong></li><li> <strong>  Having a child </strong></li><li> <strong>  Losing a dependent (They either file their own tax return, or you can no longer claim them) </strong> <br/>  </li><p> While trying to lower the amount that is withheld in taxes each pay period generally makes sense, it may be prudent to not list all of the exemptions you are eligible for on your W-4.</p><h3> Why You May Not Want to Claim all Your Allowances</h3><p> <br/> While having too much in taxes withheld can be compared to lending the Government money at a rate of zero percent interest, the reverse is also true.</p><p> If you underpay in taxes each paycheck, you end up owing money to the Government. In theory this is great. You could put the money in a savings account, and then at the end of the year pay back the Government while pocketing the interest that you collected.</p><p> In practice however this is not a prudent strategy for most people.</p><p> Individuals have a tendency to spend money that they have, and forget about longer-term consequences of their actions. Additionally while receiving a refund at the end of the year is exciting, the opposite is also true.</p><p> This is why it may make sense for you to leave a few deductions you are eligible for unlisted on your W-4. This ensures that you receive a tax refund, albeit a smaller one, rather than owing money.</p><h3> What to Do When You Do Receive a Refund</h3><p> <br/> While this advice can be helpful for next year, chances are this year&rsquo;s tax season will provide you with a large refund.</p><p> If you do receive a large refund there are a series of things you can consider to maximize its value. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p><li> <strong>  Invest in yourself &ndash; Sometimes the best investment you can make is in yourself. Consider buying a book or taking a class to help improve your performance in work or at life. </strong></li><li> <strong>  Get your will done &ndash; this can often cost less than a $1,000 in total but can save your beneficiary&rsquo;s significantly more both in terms of money as well as headache </strong></li><li> <strong>  Put money into a college savings plan </strong></li><li> <strong>  Pay down your mortgage </strong></li><li> <strong>  Invest in a non-tax-exempt account &ndash; if you have already maxed out your IRA </strong></li><li> <strong>  Save for a rainy day </strong></li><li> <strong>  Open/add to an IRA </strong></li><li> <strong>  Pay off student loan debt </strong></li><li> <strong>  Pay off credit card debt &ndash; if you have any credit card debt, this should be an immediate priority </strong></li><li> <strong>  Save the money and increase your 401(k) contributions &ndash; put your money in a safe place such as a savings account, and bump up your 401(k) contributions to reflect the fact that you have this money sitting on the side. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Regardless of what you do with your tax refund, it is important that you come up with a plan. A trusted financial planner can help you in the process of creating one.</p><p>  </p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 22:35:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 22:35:54.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_xfpjyTf.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-benefits-of-reducing-your-tax-refund/\", \"post_id\": \"9707\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 22:35:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 22:35:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-benefits-of-reducing-your-tax-refund\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9708\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4661\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-Benefits-of-Reducing-Your-Tax-Refund.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"637\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457550000,"author_id":72,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4492,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How to Get the Most From Your Exit Planning and Cash Flow","link":"how-to-get-the-most-from-your-exit-planning-and-cash-flow","source_link":null,"content":"<p> In this series, we discuss the BEI's Seven Step Exit Planning Process. We started with a comparison of Exit Planning and succession planning and followed that with establishing the foundation for an owner&rsquo;s plan: the owner&rsquo;s goals.</p><p> In this article we discuss cash flow - a critical element of quantifying any gap between an owner&rsquo;s personal and financial resources today and those they need when they exit their companies to live the post-business life they desire.</p><p> It is not uncommon for business owners to ask their advisors, based on conversations they&rsquo;ve had (or overheard) with other owners, &ldquo;Do you think I can get a six times multiple for my company?&rdquo; How do you respond?</p><p> You really cannot respond until you define &ldquo;the what&rdquo; exactly is being multiplied. This article describes the importance of making certain your owner-client, you, and the buyers in the marketplace use a common definition of the &ldquo;what.&rdquo;</p><h3> Cash Is King <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;Cash is King&rdquo; is a favorite phrase of investment bankers since the certainty of future cash from a seller&rsquo;s business can minimize the buyer&rsquo;s risk in the transaction. Buyers, however, make a slight variation to the phrase: &ldquo;Cash flow is King.&rdquo; Why? Few cash buyers are willing to part with their money unless they see the likelihood of a steadily increasing stream of cash flowing from the business, after they acquire a company. For that reason, this article explores the definition and importance of cash flow when selling a business to a financial buyer&mdash;the most common type of buyer.</p><h3> Cash Flow and OPM <br/>  </h3><p> Today&rsquo;s financial buyers are both anxious and selective about acquiring companies. They need to deploy the capital they&rsquo;ve raised from investors or return it. At the same time they are using less financing to acquire companies and more of their own (and their investors&rsquo;) capital. They can&rsquo;t afford to make costly mistakes. They seek companies that have increasing cash flow, good growth potential, and strong fundamentals (such as a strong management team and good operating systems). Of course, these characteristics have always been important signs of a good company. But, given the fact that buyers are reaching into their own wallets for fifty percent (or more) of a purchase price, minimizing risk by basing their acquisitions on strong target company cash flow has never been more critical.</p><h3> Cash Flow and Risk <br/>  </h3><p> Acquiring a business with strong cash flow reduces a buyer's risk in a transaction. Therefore, for many owners/sellers, the chance to receive maximum prices for their companies depends on current and future cash flow. It is cash flow, often described as EBITDA,   that truly is king. While most owners are familiar with the term &ldquo;EBITDA,&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they understand or use it in the same manner as professional buyers do.</p><h3> Definition of Cash Flow <br/>  </h3><p> There are several definitions or measures of cash flow, each with a potentially significant and substantive difference. For that reason, investment bankers will agree with a seller that they can get any multiple of cash flow sellers ask for as long as you let them define &ldquo;cash flow.&rdquo; The devil truly is in the details, or in this case, in the definition.</p><p> Typical measures of cash flow include Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) and EBITDA.  Another measure of cash flow is the amount of pre-tax money actually distributed to owners via salary, bonus and distributions from the company such as S-distributions and rental payments in excess of fair market rental value of the equipment or buildings used in the business.</p><p> Each of these measures of cash flow produces a different cash flow amount. Once the parties agree on how to measure cash flow, don&rsquo;t forget the seller&rsquo;s need to recast cash flow by adding back items such as excess rents and excess salary or bonuses paid to the owner and his or her family.</p><p> Which brings us back to our original question, &ldquo;Do you think I can get a six times multiple for my company?&rdquo; We suggest your response should be to first ask questions that enable you to understand what owners believe they are multiplying. The message for those of us who are Exit Planning advisors but don&rsquo;t work in M&amp;A is: make certain that owner clients share with us their definitions of cash flow and related terms (such as EBITDA). Equally important is asking the investment banker or business broker on your advisor team to review a client&rsquo;s financial information and determine EBITDA, EBIT, and cash flow in the same way as buyers do. Only then is it possible for the advisor team you lead to develop a range of likely sale price for your clients&rsquo; businesses.</p><p> A major objective in this second step of the Exit Planning process is to develop accurate information regarding your owner-client&rsquo;s financial resources rather than relying on the owner&rsquo;s opinion. Knowing the starting point&mdash;an owner&rsquo;s existing resources&mdash;is fundamental to developing an accurate road map.</p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-08 22:41:21.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-08 22:41:21.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_6s2NSK8.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-get-the-most-from-your-exit-planning-and-cash-flow/\", \"post_id\": \"9710\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-08 22:41:21\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-08 22:41:21\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-get-the-most-from-your-exit-planning-and-cash-flow\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9709\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4662\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-Get-the-Most-From-Your-Exit-Planning-and-Cash-Flow_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"726\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457525700,"author_id":240,"chart_url":""}

An overwhelming 93% of post-crash skeptics &ndash; which includes a cross-section of Gen Xers and boomers who experienced six or more major effects of the crash &ndash; said the 2008 crash still haunts them today.</p><p> <img alt=\"generations-post-crash\" src=\"https://www.allianzlife.com/~/media/images/allianz/generations_post_crash.gif?la=en\"/></p><p> 1 Post-crash skeptics are comprised of Gen Xers and boomers who&rsquo;ve experienced six or more major effects of the 2008 financial crash.</p><p> Although these results may be disheartening, the good news is that both generations do believe it&rsquo;s critically important for them to build their financial security in retirement (94% of Gen Xers and 95% of boomers).</p><h3> <br/> Gen Xers overwhelmed about their financial future and want empathetic, nonjudgmental support</h3><p> <br/> Most Gen Xers believe they will need to build their own financial security in retirement but are bogged down by uncertainty whenever they think about it. Because of this, Gen Xers are not taking action to secure their financial future and have their heads in the sand. This inaction is happening despite the fact that they are doubtful that pensions, Social Security and Medicare will be there for them and that they will have enough saved to stop working. Financial professionals can play a key role in helping Gen Xers build a solid financial future and clear up misperceptions. In seeking a financial professional, Gen Xers report that they want to work with someone who doesn't judge their financial choices and is empathetic to their actual life situation.</p><p> <img alt=\"generations_uncertainty_\" src=\"https://www.allianzlife.com/~/media/images/allianz/generations_uncertainty_infographic.png?la=en\"/></p><h3> Online Financial Advice Growing in Popularity, But Gen Xers and Boomers Still Appreciate Personalized Help</h3><p> <br/> Despite the growing popularity of online financial advice (known as robo-advisors), personal relationships with human advisors remain important for many Americans, particularity Gen Xers and baby boomers. With more robust technology available today, people are getting more comfortable with some aspects of online financial planning. However, both generations preferred having access to financial professionals who can address their specific needs beyond asset allocation and accumulation, and can shift their recommendations as personal circumstances change.</p><p> <img alt=\"Personal relationships overwhelmingly preferred over robo-advisors\" src=\"https://www.allianzlife.com/~/media/images/allianz/generations_robo_advisors.gif?la=en\"/></p><h3> Major study findings <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Romantic fantasy of the past </strong></h3><p> 82% of boomers and Generation Xers agree that a traditional retirement is a romantic fantasy of the past. More than eight in 10 (84%) from both generations said they feel that a retirement starting at age 65 spent &ldquo;doing exactly what you want&rdquo; is now unrealistic.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Disadvantaged Gen Xers </strong></h3><p> Gen X respondents were much more hopeless about their ability to achieve retirement goals and about their overall financial situation than were their boomer counterparts. Although each generation feels their circumstances have been tougher to manage, Gen X respondents indicated stronger feelings about the extent to which they feel burdened and disadvantaged by their reality. More than two thirds (67%) of Gen Xers agreed with the idea that supposed targets for how much you need to retire are way out of reach versus less than half of boomers (49%).</p><h3> <strong>  3. Warped reality </strong></h3><p> Despite clear concerns about their financial situations and prospect for a comfortable retirement, both generations are surprisingly relaxed about planning for their financial futures. An astounding percentage of boomers (65%) and Gen Xers (53%) said they \"just have this feeling that everything&rsquo;s going to work out.\"</p><h3> <strong>  4. Increasing comfort with debt </strong></h3><p> Living with debt has become a way of life for both Gen Xers and boomers as the stigma of owing money is gradually disappearing. Nearly half (48%) of both generations agree that credit cards now function as a survival tool. However, Gen Xers reported carrying about 60% more mortgage debt than their boomer counterparts. Even worse, Gen Xers have an alarming 82% more nonmortgage debt (student loans and credit cards) than boomers. This growing comfort with debt may be having a greater effect on their retirement plans. Twice as many Gen Xers (27% versus 11% of boomers) say they are either unsure about when they plan to retire or don&iacute;t plan to retire at all.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Emergence of \"Post-Crash Skeptics\" </strong></h3><p> A significant number of respondents indicated that they&rsquo;ve experienced post-crash economic trauma, including having their home or 401(k) going down in value, having them or a family member lose a job, or having their savings and/or retirement planning affected by the crash. One in five (20%) of all respondents indicated they experienced six or more of these events, identifying them as post-crash skeptics. More than two-thirds of post-crash skeptics (67%) said they changed their view of the market to risky (versus 32% of the total respondents). Additionally, 43% said they switched to more conservative investing or financial products (versus 22% of the total respondents), a fact that may adversely impact their ability to effectively save for retirement.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Empathetic support clears up uncertainty </strong></h3><p> The majority of Generation X (92%) feel that Americans are in the midst of a national retirement crisis, and an even greater number (94%) believe it's critical to build their own financial security. But, 64% of Gen Xers get bogged down with uncertainty whenever they think about retirement, so they don't take any action. Seventy-two percent feel it is almost impossible to figure out what retirement expenses are going to be, and yet there is some delusion about retirement - more than half (55%) see themselves having a relaxed, easy time of it in retirement. Financial professionals can help Gen Xers plan for a solid financial future if they know what this generation is looking for. Sixty-seven percent of Gen Xers are willing to delegate financial decisions to their financial professional, but the majority (64%) are looking for someone who makes recommendations that reflect their actual life and choices, not some ideal.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Personal relationships with human advisors are crucial for Gen Xers and baby boomers </strong></h3><p> When asked about engaging robo-advisors, nearly seven in 10 (69%) from both generations indicated they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t really trust online advice, making personal relationships more important.&rdquo; More than three-quarters (76%) believe &ldquo;there&rsquo;s so much selling online that it&rsquo;s hard to trust the financial advice.&rdquo; While more than a third (35%) of respondents said they have some interest in working with a robo-advisor (46% Gen X, 24% boomers), only 10% said they would be comfortable having their relationship with their financial advisor exist entirely online.</p><h3> Study methodology</h3><p> <br/> The Allianz Generations Apart Study, fielded by Larson Research and Strategy Consulting, was a nationwide online quantitative survey of 2,000 U.S. adults ages 35&ndash;67 with a minimum household income of $30,000. The sample was designed to achieve a 50/50 balance of men and women, and a 50/50 balance of boomers and Generation Xers. The margin of error is +/- 3%.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 14:24:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 14:24:27.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_2dofc4U.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-boomers-and-generation-xers-are-facing-the-retirement-crisis/\", \"post_id\": \"9712\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 14:24:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 14:24:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-boomers-and-generation-xers-are-facing-the-retirement-crisis\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9711\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4663\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-Boomers-and-Generation-Xers-Are-Facing-the-Retirement-Crisis.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"700\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457672400,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}

The great physicist believed they would never be detected because they are so faint. But new technology has allowed their measurement. These gravitational waves, which were created by the collision of two black holes a billion years ago, distort the fabric of space-time. When they go through a building, for example, the building actually contracts and expands as they pass through! The wake of the collision of the black holes apparently roiled time around it, making it go faster, then slower, then faster. Go figure.</p><h3> Money is a bit like a gravitational wave.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Money can, potentially, influence everything around it&mdash;your attitudes, behaviors, and even the trajectory of your life. </strong> And, although it can dramatically roil our characters, the effect is often invisible.</p><p> I&rsquo;m all for getting amply rewarded for the value we create. But keep your eyes open so that you know why you&rsquo;re doing things.</p><p> Money can make us take on client engagements that we might otherwise pass up. It can even affect the advice we give clients. For example&mdash;imagine these (quite realistic) advice scenarios:</p><li> One reasonable recommendation will lead the client to take a step that will dramatically increase the need for your services.</li><li> A second, also quite reasonable recommendation will lead the client to do something that will dramatically decrease the need for your services. <br/>  </li><h3> How do you avoid being biased in your choice of what to say?</h3><p> <br/> Studies show that when doctors own their own imaging and testing equipment, they order more tests. I&rsquo;m betting they don&rsquo;t even realize they are doing so. Money&rsquo;s influence is subtle but pervasive.</p><p> When we sold my old firm, The MAC Group, to Cap Gemini in the early 1990s, I noticed how the prospect of receiving substantial payments had a gravitational wave effect on my colleagues&rsquo; beliefs and behavior (and no doubt mine as well!). People changed their views overnight, from &ldquo;We have a great firm and we should never sell out&rdquo; to &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hack it strategically and our demise is  only a few years away&ndash;the only reasonable alternative is to sell!&rdquo; Small wonder that acquisitions are often lubricated by change of control clauses that grant senior executives large bonus payments if their company is purchased.</p><h3> Setting aside political beliefs, I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at people&rsquo;s disbelief that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had endorsed Donald Trump.</h3><p> <br/> What was so puzzling about it? Christie has a well-documented penchant for private jets and the finer things in life (nothing wrong with that&hellip;but it could be at odds with a political career as a public servant) and now that he&rsquo;s out of the race, why not ingratiate himself with a local billionaire who could help fuel his business career and lend him his jet once in a while? Revenge on Marco Rubio may have also played into it. In this case, the prospect of money blinded Christie to Trump&rsquo;s rather awful character flaws. What&mdash;you thought he endorsed Trump because of his admiration for Trump&rsquo;s exemplary vision and leadership skills? As a restaurateur friend once told me, after he had closed his money-losing but super popular restaurant frequented by business heavyweights: <strong>  &ldquo;Everyone was making deals here, and making big money. Except me!&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> My advice: Always do what is right for your client, even if it makes you redundant.</h3><p> <br/> Ask for fees commensurate with the value you add, but don&rsquo;t ever mix up your thinking about what is best for your client with how much you&rsquo;ll make from it&mdash;those should be two different discussions in your brain. Show great enthusiasm for your work. Focus on producing quality and delivering value to your clients, not on how much money it earns you. Do great things for clients, and the money will follow as a natural consequence.</p><p> Oh, and listen to my mother. She grew up in the depression, and after her father died when she was 6 years old, she and my grandmother lived in a cold-water flat on the lower east side of Manhattan. Eventually, my grandmother became an entrepreneur, started her own business, and bootstrapped them out of poverty and into a middle-class lifestyle. Mom always said, &ldquo;Money doesn&rsquo;t buy happiness, but having some of it does make life a lot easier.&rdquo; She understood, from hard experience, the difference between money as a means to an end and money as the end itself.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 16:27:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 16:27:03.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_sq5B6ah.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-do-gravitational-waves-and-money-have-in-common/\", \"post_id\": \"9713\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 16:27:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 16:27:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-do-gravitational-waves-and-money-have-in-common\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9711\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4664\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-Boomers-and-Generation-Xers-Are-Facing-the-Retirement-Crisis.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"270\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457605800,"author_id":35,"chart_url":""}

If you own a startup business, it's important that you get people board that you can rely on, who share your company's vision, and those who can consistently be on top. But these are not the only things you should look for in a team member.</p><p> The following are the important traits you want your team members to possess:</p><h3> Passion</h3><p> <br/> If you're in love with what you do, you'll certainly feel that work feels like play already. When you have workers who are passionate about their jobs, their shared passion will become an important part of your company's culture. It is for this reason that you should hire people who are passionate about what they are doing. When you have a team who works toward the same goal and with the same amount of enthusiasm, there will be no limit to what they can achieve together.</p><h3> Problem-Solving</h3><p> <br/> When evaluating a new hire, you should not only look for functional skills, but also for a candidate's ability to adapt and solve problems. Since these potential team members will have an important role in setting the tone of the company's growth, there's no point in hiring only for functional skills.</p><h3> Calculated Recklessness</h3><p> <br/> Calculated or smart recklessness could be a very important asset or skill that an employee possesses. When team members play it too safe into the company's system, it's possible that they will not discover things that will help the company achieve its goals. You have to understand that learning is an important effect of making mistakes. Furthermore, mistakes are inevitable when you want your employees to be creative. There should always be room for mistakes if you want them to grow professionally.</p><h3> Integrity</h3><p> <br/> Especially in a startup business, integrity among employees is vital. You need to be able to trust each of your team members to do their jobs well, and also to protect your company's intelligence. You may be interviewing one of the most brilliant developers in town, but if you don't feel you can't trust him or her, there's really no point in hiring them.</p><h3> Complementary Skills</h3><p> <br/> Managers have a tendency to hire people who are similar in terms of personality and even skills. What they don't realize is that they should hire people who are their opposite. Why? Well, it's because you should search for individuals who have strengths that the people they will work with do not have. That's why  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cosmiccoachingcentre.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   business consulting experts  </a> </u>  emphasize that in order for a startup business to have a team that functions well, managers have to make sure that each member has skills that complement one another.</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 16:30:27.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 16:30:27.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_NFvewWZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/important-traits-every-startup-employee-should-have/\", \"post_id\": \"9715\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 16:30:27\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 16:30:27\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"important-traits-every-startup-employee-should-have\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9714\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4665\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Important-Traits-Every-Startup-Employee-Should-Have.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"582\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457636400,"author_id":99,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4496,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Pros and Cons of Immediate Annuities","link":"pros-and-cons-of-immediate-annuities","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> 1. How do immediate annuities stack up against alternatives for providing retirement income?</h3><p> <br/> One of the biggest advantages to owning an immediate annuity (or any annuity) is that it can provide the opportunity to receive guaranteed income for life &ndash; regardless of what occurs in the market, or even in the economy overall.</p><p> Other financial alternatives may provide more or less income, based on what occurs in the market or what occurs with interest rates. An <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/annuity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  annuity </a>  is the only financial vehicle that can guarantee that its owner will not outlive its income generating capacity.</p><p> As a negative, the funds that are inside the annuity are typically no longer available when the annuitant passes away. Therefore, there are no funds left to pass on to his or her heirs. Also, once the annuity&rsquo;s stream of income is turned on, the decision cannot be reversed.</p><h3> 2. Is it a bad idea to get one during a period of low interest rates?</h3><p> <br/> Some retirees may opt to wait until interest rates rise to obtain an immediate annuity. In some ways, this can make sense, as the amount of the payment an annuitant receives is based in large part on two factors &ndash; his or her age (the older they are, the higher the payment), and what the interest rate is at the time they annuitize (the higher the rate, the larger the payment amount).</p><p> However, the issue is that nobody ever knows when interest rates will rise &ndash; or fall. Therefore, an individual could essentially wait for many years for a rise in interest rates, only to have lost out on all those years worth of income payments.</p><h3> 3. What portion of a retirement portfolio would be appropriate for this option?</h3><p> <br/> Because everyone&rsquo;s exact income needs will differ, the actual percentage allocation that should be in immediate annuities will also differ in terms of how much is appropriate. However, in general, according to Wade Pfau, a professor at the American College who specializes in retirement income, the answer could be 50%.1</p><p> This is because, based on market conditions, a hypothetical couple that is age 65 would have the best chance of success in generating a 4% annual income when using a combination of 50% equities and 50% fixed annuities.2</p><h3> 4. Who should consider an immediate annuity and who should stay away?</h3><p> <br/> Those who should consider the purchase of an immediate annuity are people who:</p><li> Are concerned about outliving their income in retirement</li><li> Have other liquid savings that they could use in case of an emergency</li><li> Have an average or above average life expectancy</li><li> Are using the immediate annuity as part of an overall plan</li><li> An immediate annuity is not the ideal option for you if:</li><li> It is the only money you have and you will have no liquidity for emergencies or cash needs</li><li> You want to leave a legacy for your heirs <br/>  </li><h3> 5. What are the key issues when shopping for one?</h3><p> <br/> When shopping for an immediate annuity it is important to ensure that the product you purchase is the right one for you. All immediate annuities are not created equal, so be sure to shop for the product that is best for your specific goals and needs.</p><p> Going through an independent agent who can help you compare the rates can be extremely beneficial in helping you find the best option. An indepedent agent should be able to shop several arriers to find you the best payout options.</p><h3> 6. Are options like inflation features and return principals worth paying for?</h3><p> <br/> Various options such as inflation could be worth the additional premium &ndash; but only under certain circumstances. Here is why. The Cost of Living Adjustment, or COLA, that is referred to by insurance companies may mean one of two things.</p><p> It could either be a level percent increase in your income payment, or it could be a true Bureau of Labor Statistics derived Consumer Price Index adjustment.

After implementation, we find that the road we are actually on is filled with bottlenecks. </p><p> Many workflow processes end up with bottlenecks, which if not managed properly, can result in your workflows collecting dust on a virtual shelf. Advisors shared some of their problems including checklists with items that didn&rsquo;t apply to many of their clients, and additional tasks that ended up being a burden on staff. In one case, tasks were assigned to one person who had over 30 tasks to complete in one day (along with her other responsibilities.)  One firm blamed the CRM software for the firm&rsquo;s workflow problems and planned to start over, beginning with a new CRM.</p><h3> Taking a few steps back is more effective than taking a drastic step</h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t equate bottlenecks with a failed implementation. Admitting that the workflows aren&rsquo;t working or staff complaining about problems in the workflow process is a positive sign. Everyone wants to make them work, but the current structure doesn&rsquo;t allow that to happen.  To achieve your goal of streamlined processes, you need to assess (not finger point) what happened and how you got to this point. </p><p> Re-visit the roads you took</p><h3> <strong>  Review how you implemented workflows and reflect on which turn your firm made during each step along the way: </strong></h3><p>  </p><h3> Staff buy-ins - Did you voluntarily receive, or demand them?</h3><p> Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve had managers tell me how to do a task (incorrectly by the way), why I should see views their way (even though I had my own views), and why my agreeing with them is good for the company (with a pat on my back and a big smile on their faces). </p><h3> The decision to implement workflows may come from the CEO or top management, but the implementation requires a firm-wide team effort. </h3><p> Raef Lee, Head of New Services and Strategic Partnerships, SEI Advisor Network, understands the importance of staff buy-ins when it comes to building successful workflows. &ldquo;Most firms get the idea that top management support is essential. Just as essential is that everyone involved in the workflows is involved in their creation. This means everyone in the firm. When designing a workflow have a meeting including everyone and design it together. This is the way to ensure adoption.&rdquo;, said Raef</p><h3> Workflow assessment &ndash; Impartial or biased?</h3><p> During the initial design process, perhaps you insisted on automating the current processes without improvements because &ldquo;this is the way we always did it.&rdquo; Or, without understanding what the right solution is for your firm, you constantly pointed to the CRM vendor, templates, and other firms&rsquo; workflow processes. </p><p> Outside references are a great starting point; however, they should not be your end point. Taking the time upfront to assess what the right practices are for your firm, your staff, and your clients will increase the odds of the streamlined processes you envisioned.  </p><h3> Project manager &ndash; The right person, or any person?</h3><p> What is the most important aspect of a successful workflow implementation &ndash; the CRM software, vendor, workflow templates, your clients, or your staff?</p><p> Answer: All of them. Good project management skills require an understanding of the implementation at several levels. Your designated leader needs to know how to manage resources at all levels, resolve conflicts from within and outside the firm throughout the development period, and facilitate discussions toward agreement on the processes involved.  </p><h3> Client services &ndash; Did you implement steps covering most, or a few clients?</h3><p> Which clients were you thinking about when implementing workflows? While the 80/20 rule is enough for most situations, the key here is developing processes that fit closer to 100%. One issue is getting too bogged down with the details of every client&rsquo;s processes, and then creating too many steps for most client situations. </p><p> According to Raef, <strong>  &ldquo;The answer is to not have too detailed workflows. It is really 98/2 rule. A workflow should be designed for nearly all circumstances. If you reach 80/20 it is too detailed and you should rework it.&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> A better vision for your workflows</h3><p> <br/> Understanding the underlying issues with your bottlenecks enables you to identify solutions that can be implemented. Whether it&rsquo;s giving your staff more input into the process, better understanding your clients&rsquo; needs, or ensuring the right person is leading the project, your end result will be processes that work for the firm.</p><p> Your vision should be clearer now</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 16:42:13.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 16:42:13.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_8xMeddr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-streamline-the-workflow-process/\", \"post_id\": \"9718\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 16:42:13\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 16:42:13\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-streamline-the-workflow-process\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9719\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4667\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-Streamline-the-Workflow-Process.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1308\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457612100,"author_id":462,"chart_url":""}

Close to two million of these layoffs will come from the coal industry alone.</p><p> The layoffs are part of a series of sweeping reforms that were announced ahead of the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC) meeting. Every year, close to 3,000 Chinese officials and executives from all over the country convene in Beijing to develop and assess the status of the country&rsquo;s Five-Year Plan. In response to worldwide demands that China manage its slowing economy better, President Xi Jinping this year has proposed what he calls &ldquo;supply-side structural reform.&rdquo;</p><h3> And if that sounds a little like Reaganomics, that&rsquo;s kind of the point.</h3><p> <br/> Besides layoffs, Xi&rsquo;s plan includes tax cuts, deregulation and reductions in state spending&mdash;economic policies you might expect to come from the desk of Reagan or Thatcher. We might also expect the results of these policies to be the same in China as in the U.S. and United Kingdom in the 1980s: a boom in entrepreneurship and innovation.</p><p> These reforms come at a crucial time for China, whose manufacturing sector has been in contraction mode for a year now as the country&rsquo;s economy shifts toward domestic consumption. In February, China&rsquo;s purchasing manager&rsquo;s index (PMI) fell to 48.0 from 48.4 in January.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-04/COMM-chinese-manufacturing-in-contraction-mode-for-12-straight-months-03042016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Chinese Manufacturing in Contraction Mode for 12 Straight Months\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-04/COMM-chinese-manufacturing-in-contraction-mode-for-12-straight-months-03042016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> We closely follow government policy changes in China for a number of reasons. For one, its economy is the second largest in the world, and when based on purchasing power parity (PPP), its GDP is actuallythe largest, followed by the U.S., India and Japan. China&rsquo;s economy, then, has a huge effect on the rest of the world, touching everything from commodities demand to consumption.</p><p> In 2015, total retail sales in China touched a record, surpassing 30 trillion renminbi, or about $4.2 trillion. By 2020, sales are expected to climb to $6.4 trillion, representing 50 percent growth in as little as five years. This growth will &ldquo;roughly equal a market 1.3 times the size of Germany or the United Kingdom,&rdquo; according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).</p><p> One of the main reasons for this surge in consumption is the staggering expansion of the country&rsquo;s middle class. In October, Credit Suisse reported that, for the first time, the size of China&rsquo;s middle class had exceeded that of America&rsquo;s middle class,  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/10-numbers-to-know-for-the-chinese-new-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  109 million to 92 million. </a>  As incomes rise, so too does demand for durable and luxury goods, vehicles, air travel, energy and more.</p><p> <img alt=\"109 Million - For the first time, the size of China's middle class has overtaken the U.S., 109 million compared to 92 million.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-04/Chinas-Middle-Class-Overtakes-US-11202015.jpg\"/></p><p> But middle-income families aren&rsquo;t the only ones growing in number.

These levels are generally not an absolute. While a Level 3 may show up under certain circumstances as a Level 1, the key is to identify how they show up the majority of the time. It is also important to determine how they show up under stress or when something isn&rsquo;t going their way.  Now I don&rsquo;t recommend that you intentionally create a stressful situation but I do recommend that you pay close attention to how they react when something doesn&rsquo;t go their way.</p><h3> <strong>  Level 1&rsquo;s </strong></h3><p> <br/> Level 1 people have a low  <u>  <a href=\"http://millionaireseries.com/7pebook-us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   worth barometer  </a> </u> , lack self-esteem &amp; have beliefs that do not support their goals. They also lack responsibility and ownership. They show up as a victim or bully. They live by a lose-win (victim) or a win-lose (bully) mentality. They spend the majority of their time living in negative, low energy environments which include blame, worry, anger and fear. Because their life isn&rsquo;t working (at some level), they want others lives to not work.</p><p> When you provide input to a level 1 that they don&rsquo;t wish to hear, they will find a way to prove you are wrong (which is how they react to most of the advice anyone provides them). The primary reason they do this is because they live in fear. Fear that they are wrong, fear that they are not enough, fear of what it would take to change their reality.</p><p> To learn more about these levels, go to: &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://millionaireseries.com/products-7-principles-becoming-millionaire-life-ebook-msu-community/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   7 Principles  </a> </u> &ldquo;</p><p> They are defensive, complain, blame and gossip and look for what is wrong.

This is the most overlooked level. It is also the biggest potential for future business. The key to this level is to consistently follow up with them so when the time is right, you will be on the top of their radar. The Level 2&rsquo;s that ultimately show up as Level 1&rsquo;s are best replaced with prospects that are on track to joining the Level 3 club.</p><h3> <strong>  Level 3&rsquo;s </strong></h3><p> <br/> Level 3&rsquo;s are your ideal clients.

{"original_id":4500,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Why Most Banks Fail at Transformational Change","link":"why-most-banks-fail-at-transformational-change","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I had a few wake up calls in my years of working in financial services, and a couple of key ones gave me an insight into the mentality of major financial firms that have stayed pretty true ever since.  The first was working with a major bank on a process re-engineering project.  We had narrowed down the project to one of two areas: payments or mortgages.  I was really keen to try rethinking the mortgage process, as it was complicated and challenging.  Spanning several products &ndash; mortgage loan, life assurance products, home insurance products and the deposit account &ndash; it would be an amazing leap in thinking.  We had already rebadged the mortgage making a home, and realized that the customer experience could be transformed.  Customers didn&rsquo;t want to have a mortgage product or financing to buy a home, we had realized.  What they wanted was to feel safe that they could afford to buy and eventually own the house they had found.  This fact was forgotten in the 2000s, when we had a house buying explosion fuelled by Credit Default Swaps and Buy-to-Let Landlords, but the key to the mortgage and home buying process is the ability to afford the loan, the security of living in that home, and the confidence of eventually owning that home.</p><h3> Meantime, the payments process &ndash; which the bank called money transmissions &ndash; was just a bit boring. </h3><p> <br/> It was looking at taking a few percentage points off the cost of moving money from bank-to-bank via BACS, CHAPS and SWIFT.  Yeuch.</p><p> The bank chose the latter project however, much to my dismay.  When I asked them why we had to do the boring project, they answered: because it&rsquo;s safe.  The decision maker felt that the mortgage project was not only too big to pull off, because it involved so many line of business heads and spanned multi-functions and multi-products, but was too risky to succeed until they had gained some experience of re-engineering first.  Hence, they chose the payments process as their first and only project.  They never got around to rethinking the home making process and, twenty years later, when I met the guy who was the decision maker, now retiring, he said to me: &ldquo;you know Chris, I wish we had done something bigger, but the bank&rsquo;s culture is to avoid step change&rdquo;.  I asked him if the mortgage process was still the same, spread over many lines of business and zero integration.  &ldquo;Yep&rdquo;, he sighed, as he walked into the vault (bankers never retire, they just move into the vault).</p><h3> Sigh.</h3><p> <br/> So then another project some years later came to light.  This project was for a large insurance company and we were going to embark on a step change project.  The project was half way through, and we had started with: how would we build this company today if it didn&rsquo;t exist?  After days of brainstorming processes, products, services and structures, we had designed the ultimate customer process.  Our project had begun by looking at how the customer interacted with the insurance group and how, if we were the customer, we would want to interact.  After some deep dive sessions, we had created the ultimate customer touch vision, and had then come back to Earth to see how that vision related to the current insurance operations.  They didn&rsquo;t.  We concluded that to create the ultimate insurance company we would have to transform the firm and re-engineer systems, structures and services to build the #1 insurance company in Britain and possibly the World.</p><h3> Yay!</h3><p> <br/> Unfortunately, the project got shot down by the CEO before it got to fly.  The reason given is that the company did not need to be the ultimate customer experience or #1.  They were doing fine as they were.  In a debrief session with the Head of Innovation, he told me that he had really pushed the project to succeed but the CEO was retiring in 18 months and did not feel it was worth the risk.</p><p> The reason I recount these two stories is that they pretty much sum-up the culture and attitude of the average incumbent financial firm.  Most of the firms are run by CEO&rsquo;s who have risen to the top of the organisation over decades and only have three to five years to make their mark.  By the time someone suggests a transformational moment, the incumbent CEO believes it is far too risky to their short-term tenure to take a long-term bet.  This is why most incumbent CEO&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t change core systems, don&rsquo;t transform processes and products and don&rsquo;t do anything radical.  It&rsquo;s not worth it as they just want to steer a steady course, get their shareholding bonus and build a nice pension pot.</p><p> Equally, when it comes to transformational change, it is rarely viewed as worth it.  Because most of the institution&rsquo;s competitors are doing nothing radical, the incumbent does the same.  Fast following and low risk incremental change are the mantras of the industry.  Transformation, disruption and step change breakthroughs are relatively unheard of.</p><h3> This may be the biggest risk to the incumbent institutions today however. </h3><p> <br/> After all, Fintech is completely dedicated to transformation, disruption and breakthrough change.  If banks stick firmly to their low risk incremental strategies, they will never be able to keep up with the fast moving transformational Fintech community.</p><p> Now some banks seem to be trying to create ways to embrace this change: incubators, accelerators, hackathons, Open days, investment arms, venture capital funds and more are all there, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean the banks mentality has changed.  Banks are still led by CEOs who came to the top of the heap as CFOs with financial acumen or CROs with risk aversion.   Very few CEOs were technologists or even understand technology.  They don&rsquo;t understand why the bank can&rsquo;t deliver a simple app and believe that blockchain is something they have to have, but have no idea why.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m dissing these guys, as if I would.  Just as I have no idea how a butterfly option works or the differences between IFRS and GAAP accounting, it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m stupid.  It just means that I&rsquo;m not qualified to run the investment bank or the finances.  Do I need to understand them?  At basic level yes, otherwise how could I be heading up the bank, but at a detailed level I just need to make sure I have the right talent that I can trust to look after these areas.  This is what really concerns me in most incumbent banks, in that they have the wrong talent.  The person looking after the Digital Bank and Fintech change for the bank are too often people the CEO has placed there to be their keep the troops happy person:don&rsquo;t rattle the cages, transform the bank, shake the trees or battle the internal politics.  Just do enough incremental change to make it look like we&rsquo;re engaged.  </p><p> It won&rsquo;t work guys.  On the other hand, you put a real change wizard in that role and what seems to happen, in most cases, is that they leave.  I always remember a comment from one change wizard was that, in most organisations, they either wear you out or wait you out.  Either way you&rsquo;re out.</p>","channel":6,"channel_url":6,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 17:56:52.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 17:56:52.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_2MCFFKr.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/why-most-banks-fail-at-transformational-change/\", \"post_id\": \"9722\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 17:56:52\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 17:56:52\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"why-most-banks-fail-at-transformational-change\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9723\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4670\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Why-Most-Banks-Fail-at-Transformational-Change.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"326\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457629200,"author_id":111,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4501,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Leading Business in Today's Environment Isn't for the Risk-Averse","link":"leading-business-in-todays-environment-isnt-for-the-risk-averse","source_link":null,"content":"<p> Operating a business &ndash; particularly a profitable and growing business &ndash; has always included risks. Specific risks and perceived importance of those risks varies by industry, business type among other factors.</p><p> Volatility in today&rsquo;s business environment, new risks tied to technology; industry-related risks; compensating business leaders based on risk taking; and the increase in regulatory compliance all create increased complexity. Therefore, risk management is increasing in scope, scale and prominence across organizations of all types and sizes.</p><h3> Risk as a Component of Leader Compensation</h3><p> <br/> There is considerable debate regarding the right amount and the types of risk business leaders need to take to achieve both company growth and protect stakeholder interests. Often top C-level officers&rsquo; compensation contains a component with incentives specific to the company&rsquo;s financial performance. Sometimes questions arise when considering how the incentive of stock options based on company performance does &ndash; or could &ndash; induce a CEO to take risks that may not be in the best interest of the company long term, and/or may be outside the risk tolerance of the board.</p><p> Creating a perfectly aligned risk scenario within a compensation package has never been easy. Given increasing risks experienced by all organizations based on numerous factors, volatility and risks outside of the CEO&rsquo;s (or the board&rsquo;s) control, the task is even more complicated.</p><h3> Risk and Return</h3><p> <br/> One way to evaluate risk is in terms of potential return and the likelihood of that return given different risk levels. Weighing risks and probabilities against likely returns and probabilities provides leaders with the basis for making strategic decisions to create growth.</p><p> Transformative innovation &ndash; often required for atypical growth &ndash; always involves risk. Not every innovation initiative will be successful. Growth plans must include costs from failed initiatives. Incremental change is far less risky, but will not produce the rewards possible with transformative innovation that is on target.</p><p> Compensation packages aside, it&rsquo;s often desirable for CEOs to have a personal stake in the organization they lead. Many factors go into CEO selection. An individual&rsquo;s demonstrated risk appetite, risk tolerance, approach to managing and mitigating risks, along with their history of taking strategic risks, effectively managing risk over time and the ROI tied to business risks. Beyond intrinsic business risks, growth-focused company leaders must take calculated risks to achieve increased growth and profitability necessary to achieve business objectives.</p><p> In 2015 Accenture conducted multiple risk studies* across several industries. When considering risk management in multiple North American sectors there were multiple common findings:</p><li> <strong>  Digital is driving increased risk &ndash; with cyber risk expected to increase </strong></li><li> <strong>  Risk analytics are currently not used sufficiently in day-to-day operations </strong></li><li> <strong>  Appetite for risk related to innovation, product development and/or new alliances and partnerships is growing </strong> <br/>  </li><h3> The Role of Compliance  </h3><p> <br/> Companies are subject to various compliance requirements. Adhering to regulations or policies specific to achieving compliance is meant to decrease risk. However, unless a company has a culture of &ldquo;doing the right thing,&rdquo; policies become irrelevant.</p><p> In some companies the focus and energy spent on compliance are reactive. In the best companies leaders build strong relationships with their business partners, work to understand their partners&rsquo; businesses, and proactively incorporate compliance from the very beginning.</p><p> &ldquo;Out of Alignment&rdquo;** a survey of chief compliance officers, found 58% of respondents believe the compliance function is not integrated sufficiently into corporate decision-making and strategy. They believe insufficient staffing (22%) and a lack of management buy-in (16%) were most responsible for the lack of integration.</p><p> Little is certain in today&rsquo;s global business environment. Successful leaders will focus on understanding risks, drivers and probabilities, and taking calculated risks when the potential for substantial return is sufficient.</p><h3> Action Items: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  How well does your company culture communicate the importance of everyone in the company adhering to a code of always &ldquo;doing the right thing&rdquo;? </strong> Something this simple is far more memorable &ndash; and more likely to be acted upon &ndash; by employees daily than a complex statement. As well, reinforcing this cultural imperative by both walking the walk and talking the talk will greatly help imbed this practice among employees.</li><li> <strong>  Assess your process for when risk/reward evaluations are made. </strong> Ensure the evaluations apply not only to huge decisions, but are widely used to make decisions throughout the company. It may be desirable to share basic calculations for employees not accustomed to this type of decision-making tool.</li><li> <strong>  Are you complying because you must? </strong> If so, re-evaluate company compliance from the perspective of becoming proactive, ensuring compliance is on the table from the beginning when building third-party relationships, and when considering new initiatives.</li><p> <br/> *Accenture 2015 Global Risk Management Study <br/> **DiPietro, Ben, &ldquo;Out of Alignment&rdquo;, a survey of chief compliance officers by Consero Group, The Wall Street Journal, February 12, 2016</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 18:26:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 18:26:11.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_glAmWKC.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/leading-business-in-todays-environment-isnt-for-the-risk-averse/\", \"post_id\": \"9724\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 18:26:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 18:26:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"leading-business-in-todays-environment-isnt-for-the-risk-averse\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9723\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4671\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Why-Most-Banks-Fail-at-Transformational-Change.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"342\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457632800,"author_id":464,"chart_url":""}

It was memorable mostly because I had to shake Alice&rsquo;s hand to greet her and at ten years of age, shaking a girl&rsquo;s hand was pretty nervewracking. In any case, I carried the task out to critical acclaim and the show ran for a full two nights!</p><p> In the original book, &ldquo;Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland&rdquo; upon which the stage play was based, there is a wonderful exchange between Alice, who is wandering through the woods, and the Cheshire Cat, perched on a brand overhanging the path. When she sees the cat, she asks him a question:</p><p> &ldquo;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;That depends a good deal on <strong>  where you want to get to </strong> ,&rdquo; said the Cat. <br/> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care where&ndash;&rdquo; said Alice. <br/> &ldquo;Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter which way you go,&rdquo; said the Cat. <br/> &ldquo;&ndash;so long as I get SOMEWHERE,&rdquo; Alice added as an explanation. <br/> &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re sure to do that,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;if you only walk long enough.</p><p> Simultaneously whimsical and profound, there is a tremendous lesson that businesses can take away from a seemingly simple exchange such as this. In business, we rush to tactics in the hopes that the tactics solve a bigger problem. We treat symptoms in our business as if they are the problems, confusing motion with progress.</p><h3> We often make decisions based on short-term needs or trends rather than long-term vision or purpose.</h3><p> <br/> We make decisions that &ldquo;feel&rdquo; right, not realizing that others may &ldquo;feel&rdquo; differently and this subjective approach to decision making means that we might all mean well but we end up pulling in different directions based on our own biases and feelings.</p><p> When Simon Sinek delivered his now famous Ted Talk in 2009, he popularized the notion that it was not only acceptable, but it was actually essential that we &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Start with Why  </a> </u> &rdquo; in everything we do.

What are the next 5 marketing campaigns we should consider? What should our logo look like? How can we ensure we develop the best culture? Questions like these are asked every day, but until we stop to ask &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; then we can never truly answer them.</p><p> The greatest businesses and organizations lead with a purpose greater than their products or services. This purpose determines people, positioning, products, process, and profits. From here strategies can be developed which will inform tactics which will (when executed successfully) achieve the goals necessary to fulfill the purpose.</p><p> So the next time you have a difficult decision to make or you can&rsquo;t get buy-in from team members, stop, look up at the tree limb and let the Cheshire Cat ask you his question &ldquo;Where do you want to get to?&rdquo;</p><p> By answering that question, it&rsquo;s amazing how different the solutions can look.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 18:37:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 18:37:16.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_k4Cq7pd.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/where-do-you-want-to-get-to/\", \"post_id\": \"9725\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 18:37:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 18:37:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"where-do-you-want-to-get-to\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9723\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4672\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Why-Most-Banks-Fail-at-Transformational-Change.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"502\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457640900,"author_id":53,"chart_url":""}

The chain, spun off from Kmart, was acquired by private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners for $1.3 billion in 2006 and taken private. The firm holds such diverse retail brands as BJ&rsquo;s Wholesale Club, David&rsquo;s Bridal, Jo-Ann Fabric and Crafts, and Tourneau in a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.leonardgreen.com/Investments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   diverse portfolio of industries  </a> </u> .</p><p> The company missed a $20 million interest payment on $343 million of its debt in January, but has arranged to borrow $595 million to handle its operations while the bankruptcy proceeds. CNN notes that  <u>  <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/02/news/companies/sports-authority-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\">   the debt load from the leveraged buyout  </a> </u>  hampered Sports Authority&rsquo;s ability to compete with location retailers like Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods, as well as a multiplying field of online retailers, specialty shops, and resellers. <strong>  The failure to anticipate fitness trends, anticipate the explosion of online shopping, and not modernizing stores dealt the Death of 1,000 Cuts to a once solid go-to brand.  </strong></p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.vanhornlawgroup.com/chapter-11-bankruptcy-for-businesses-qa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chapter 11  </a> </u>  is  <u>  <a href=\"http://retailindustry.about.com/od/topusretailcompanies/a/chapter11retail.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   not, however, a magic wand  </a> </u> , and there are no guarantees that the company can bounce back. Even with restructuring their debt, selling stores, liquidating stock, and condensing, the chain may not be able to execute the changes quickly enough to make a difference. The lesson was graphically demonstrated by Circuit City&rsquo;s Chapter 11 filing in 2008. The former electronics powerhouse was faced with many of the same problems being faced by Sports Authority &ndash; older stores, lack of internet presence, and heavy competition from a newer chain of stores called Best Buy. With $2.2 billion in debt, Circuit City was able to borrow $1.1 billion to continue operations while restructuring. <strong>  Unable to find a buyer by January of 2009, the chain converted its bankruptcy to a Chapter 7, liquidated, and closed its doors.  </strong></p><p> Even  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_29586999/exclusive-sports-authority-ceo-talks-about-chains-post\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sport&rsquo;s Authority&rsquo;s CEO admits to the Denver Post  </a> </u>  that there&rsquo;s no Magic 8 Ball on this one.

I&rsquo;m happy to fill in for my coworkers while they&rsquo;re away but I was thinking I should be compensated for the extra work since I&rsquo;m doing more than just my normal job now. What do you think?</p><p> &mdash; &ndash;</p><h3> <strong>  Dear Employee, </strong></h3><p> <br/> I feel an avalanche of NO snowballing inside of me, and it&rsquo;s growing bigger and bigger with each breath. It&rsquo;s the kind of avalanche that destroys villages, takes no prisoners, bulldozes over anything in its way. It&rsquo;s like a vacuum chamber of NO where nothing else can exist besides NO. I think this was a good talk though. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me I have to go tear up the gift card I was going to give you as a thank you.</p><p> &mdash; &ndash;</p><h3> <strong>  Why Your Torture Plan Will Surely Backfire </strong></h3><p> <br/> On the one hand, adding more work to your plate without compensation breaks the psychological contract between employer and employee. If you find your job description changing day-to- day and twice the expected work loaded on to you then you should definitely have a talk about more money. On the other hand, filling in temporarily for a coworker on leave or doing some added work here and there is expected in the workplace. It&rsquo;s part of being a team player or just someone who walks the earth. It&rsquo;s also good practice for an employer to acknowledge the effort in some way, but preemptively asking for money before you&rsquo;ve even begun the extra work feels like a vague form of blackmail, leaving the boss to subconsciously wonder &ldquo;&hellip;and if you don&rsquo;t get the extra money&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p> &mdash; &ndash;</p><h3> <strong>  Maybe Try this Instead? </strong></h3><p> <br/> See the bigger picture. Be the team player. Help your coworkers. You need allies in the workplace. Filling in for people or occasionally going the extra mile is a sure-fire way to build your own team within the larger company team. If you are working for a company that acknowledges hard work and rewards performance then rest assured the compensation will come your way in due time. The preemptive ask is an impression you don&rsquo;t want to make. A boss would rather see the task get done first and worry about the compensation second than to have to worry about negotiating salary parameters for every task that pops up. If you are working for a company that does not reward or acknowledge, and the external pats on the back are important to you (as it is to many of us) then it&rsquo;s time to evaluate if it&rsquo;s the right fit for the long run.</p>","channel":2,"channel_url":2,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 22:47:24.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 22:47:24.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_2Obzxk4.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-torture-your-boss-by-asking-for-more-money-every-time-youre-given-more-responsibility/\", \"post_id\": \"9728\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 22:47:24\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 22:47:24\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-torture-your-boss-by-asking-for-more-money-every-time-youre-given-more-responsibility\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9726\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4674\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sports-Authoritys-Road-to-Filing-Chapter-11-Bankruptcy.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"538\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457618400,"author_id":156,"chart_url":""}

But you&rsquo;d be surprised at how far technology and the digital era have come over the years; so far in fact that some of todays jobs didn&rsquo;t even exist! Back in 2006 Amy Winehouse dominated the charts with Valerie and the Scissor Sisters didn&rsquo;t feel like dancing, check out these digital jobs that weren&rsquo;t around then&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  SEO Specialist </strong></h3><p> <br/> If I said to you SEO 10 years ago you&rsquo;d probably look at me and ask if it&rsquo;s a new girl band. But search engine optimisation unquestionably has become a great driving force behind any successful website and without a doubt is one of the few methods in getting your website up the rankings. With over 50,000  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google  </a> </u>  searches a second, SEO has never been more important.</p><h3> <strong>  App Designer </strong></h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Apple  </a> </u>  hadn&rsquo;t even created the first iPhone, Androids were the stuff of sci-fi movies and apps were completely non-existent. Can you believe it? Back then you actually had to go to a ATM to check your bank balance and I&rsquo;m afraid  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.angrybirds.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Angry Birds  </a> </u>  wasn&rsquo;t even created. Thank you to the geniuses at Apple who saved every smartphone user the hassle of having to carry an AA map in the car; how did we ever survive without Google Maps?                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p><h3> <strong>  Vlogger </strong></h3><p> The now go to career for any teen that wants to become rich and famous without having to sing or act. Vlogging has now seen the likes of  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/zoella280390?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Zoella  </u>    </a> and  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/smosh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Smosh  </u>    </a> make millions within a few short years and with the vast majority of vloggers in their 20s or younger, why wouldn&rsquo;t teens see the huge appeal in vlogging? Once upon a time the closest thing to vlogging was the Blair Witch Project and look how that turned out, so we should be very grateful for platforms like  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   YouTube  </u>    </a> who make vlogging possible.</p><h3> <strong>  Content Marketing Executive </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the hottest digital jobs in recent years, marketing has come a long way in 10 years as roles like Content Marketing have surfaced. Since the rise in blogs, online quizzes and the constant traffic to websites through articles, someone has to be in charge of these and lucky for us there&rsquo;s a job specifically designed to do so. What else would we do on our Sunday nights without the people behind creating quizzes like &lsquo;Which character from Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets are you?&rsquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Online Advertising Manager </strong></h3><p> <br/> With interactive banners and PPC at the forefront of online advertising, to think in 2006 the frontrunner of the online advertisement industry were those dreaded popups, which was enough to completely shut down your computer all together. Now with online advertisement at the biggest it&rsquo;s ever been there needs to be someone designing the ads, creating catchphrases on campaigns and spotting online trends.</p><h3> <strong>  Social Media Manager </strong></h3><p> <br/> As far as 2006 was concerned we were still using the likes of Myspace, MSN and Bebo to communicate, asking our best friends to &lsquo;share the love&rsquo; or nudging people on MSN who weren&rsquo;t replying&hellip; although they did say BRB. Now social media is one of the biggest things to hit the internet since keyboard cat. With the likes of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Twitter  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Instagram  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Snapchat  </a> </u>  and  <a href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Pinterest  </u>    </a> to name a few, there&rsquo;s no wonder that companies need to employ extra hands to oversee and use these free platforms to the companies best ability.</p><h3> <strong>  3D Designer </strong></h3><p> <br/> There was a time that having your own printer at home would cost an absolute bomb, never mind the ink cartridges to fill them up. So when that was the case, off you went to your local library or convenience store, anywhere that you could print out anything and everything. Now thanks to how amazing technology is we&rsquo;re exposed to 3D printers that can print off keyrings to tools. Imagine if we were exposed to these in 2006? We&rsquo;d be making a lot of CD covers because your sibling sat on your favourite  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Furtado\" target=\"_blank\">   Nelly Furtado  </a> </u>  CD.</p><h3> <strong>  Cloud Services Specialist </strong></h3><p> <br/> Although cloud has been around since the early noughties, Cloud Services Specialist first came onto the scene when Google announced it in their 2006 annual conference and since then we haven&rsquo;t been able to get enough of it. Looking after the technologies, mechanisms, devices etc of cloud storage technologies and services, it&rsquo;s these guys you need to thank that are behind the running of being able to store all those selfies on your phone.</p><h3> <strong>  Data Scientist </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not rocket science to guess what a data scientist does. No, there not in lab working on some big research experiment but actually analysing all the data the internet has to offer. Sounds fun hey? The UK is actually expected to create an average of 56,000 big data jobs a year until 2020 so the jokes on you if you&rsquo;re not part of the data science phenomenon.</p><h3> <strong>  User Experience Design </strong></h3><p> <br/> These designers are the wonderful people behind making you&rsquo;re daily digital and technology interactions a joyful experience. Controlling the HTML and CSS of websites, without these professionals we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to surf our favourite websites with such pleasure. How did we even survive without them?</p><p> Whilst we may now take for granted the hashtag and when we need help we simply just YouTube &lsquo;how to&rsquo; videos, in 2006 YouTube surprisingly was only a year old and Twitter had just been born! 10 years later and we&rsquo;ve advanced so much that we no longer need to give our computer what&rsquo;s probably equivalent to the death penalty in order to download songs and Wi-Fi actually exists not only in your own home but in public places.</p><p> So to all you budding digital professionals, be fortunate that you weren&rsquo;t born 10 years earlier, as you wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting in the job you are today.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-09 23:18:26.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-09 23:18:26.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_duj6yqD.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-digital-jobs-that-didnt-exist-10-years-ago/\", \"post_id\": \"9730\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-09 23:18:26\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-09 23:18:26\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-digital-jobs-that-didnt-exist-10-years-ago\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9729\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4675\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10-Digital-Jobs-That-Didn\\u2019t-Exist-10-Years-Ago.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"4\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"809\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"90\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457640000,"author_id":189,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4506,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"How We Can Change the Perception of Women in the Workplace","link":"how-we-can-change-the-perception-of-women-in-the-workplace","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> Early in my career, I read an article which said men generally cast women into 1 of 5 roles in the workplace.</h3><p> <br/> Those 5 roles are Mother, Wife, Girlfriend/Mistress, Sister or Daughter.</p><li> <strong>  Mother is expected to coddle and comfort and cover, even when you&rsquo;re not doing what you should. </strong> Sometimes they nag or punish you &mdash; but not too severely because mother never wants to see you suffer.</li><li> <strong>  Wife is expected to help and support the men they work with, no matter what. </strong> They nag more often than mothers &mdash; but they don&rsquo;t press too hard because they care for and rely on you. The wife is all bark but no bite.</li><li> <strong>  Girlfriend/Mistress is expected to help and support the men they work with. </strong> Because there is chemistry and affinity, the girlfriend/mistress often receives reciprocal help and support. However, the length and level of loyalty is limited because commitment to the relationship is missing.</li><li> <strong>  Sister switches from collaborator to competitor and back again with the men they work with. </strong> Because the relationship feels familial, there is reciprocal help and a level of loyalty in the relationship.</li><li> <strong>  Daughter needs to be looked out for by the men they work with. </strong> She needs coddling, comfort, cover and coaching. She yields loyalty and commitment and is treated with kindness. <br/>  </li><h3> On the surface, these roles are harmless.</h3><p> <br/> In fact, men are often cast into the same roles (father, husband, boyfriend, brother, son) &hellip; However, men have 2 additional roles rarely attributed to women &mdash; coach and boss.</p><p> For men and women who participate in sports or other competitive activities at some point in life, they see men in coaching roles more often than they see women. When they encounter a person at work who is demanding but caring, they put them in the coach box &hellip; If they&rsquo;ve never had a woman coach, they won&rsquo;t view women at work thru this lens and they&rsquo;ll put a demanding but caring woman in the mother or wife box instead. Same applies if they&rsquo;ve never had a woman as boss previously.</p><p> Again, on the surface, this seems harmless &hellip; But what happens when a man&rsquo;s relationship with these roles are not positive? For women, we can switch up and view thru the lens of coach or boss &mdash; where we know those roles must be respected and revered, even when our personal feelings about the individual isn&rsquo;t positive. For men, they often can&rsquo;t get beyond the familial lens to see the woman thru a lens that commands respect. The relationship becomes peppered with resistance, defiance, insolence and passive-aggressive behaviors that can damage a working relationship beyond repair.</p><h3> When men encounter women of color in the workplace, it can be even worse. </h3><p> <br/> If a man has not encountered women of color regularly outside of work, they often cannot see them thru any of these lenses. When this happens, women of color are relegated to stereotypes and caricatures instead. Stereotypes and caricatures are rarely worthy of respect or loyalty.</p><p> These roles and lenses create a minefield of issues surrounding gender in our workplaces. From the outside looking in, no one really understand why the relationship isn&rsquo;t working &mdash; and the woman is often blamed for the persisting problem and the lack of resolution.</p><p> The article from all those years ago essentially told women there was nothing they could do to break beyond the confines of these roles. It advised women to position themselves to be placed in the roles of sister or daughter to avoid being viewed as nagging or coddling &hellip; Early in my career, I tried to follow this. It worked. In some ways, it still does. I&rsquo;ve watched enough women and men cast into these roles to believe this is true and operating in workplaces all over.</p><h3> I&rsquo;m ready to turn the page on this. I&rsquo;m ready to see women break free of these roles.</h3><p> <br/> We cannot do this without help and change by men. Men have to push and force themselves to see women as coaches and bosses in addition to the other roles.</p><p> How?</p><li> <strong>  Recognize and talk about male entitlement. </strong>  Examine your workplace and your co-worker relationships to see which roles exist. Where the roles are having negative impact, speak up about it and support the women in making things better. Make it right.</li><li> <strong>  Expose yourself to women coaches and bosses. </strong>  Attend their seminars. Read their books and articles. Watch them on television shows and documentaries. Not just the ones on women talking about women stuff &mdash; but especially the ones where women are talking about the stuff of life, work, leadership and success. And when the opportunity arises, hire or promote women. Make it right.</li><li> <strong>  Admit and understand subtle sexism is a real thing. </strong>  So often when women point out subtle sexist behaviors at work, their point of view is dismissed because there is no clear evidence. Gone are the days where women are openly grabbed or called vulgar names (for the most part). More often the sexism is much more nuanced and complex. If a behavior displayed would be accepted and/or celebrated by a man but is condemned in a woman, sexism is at play. If a behavior displayed would be rejected and/or corrected in a man but is expected from a woman, sexism is at play.

While this is good news for a world that needs innovation and technological savvy &ndash; two areas in which Milennials excel &ndash; it can be difficult news for companies who don&rsquo;t know how to effectively manage this new generation of workers.</p><p> In fact, many of the management techniques that worked so well with Baby Boomers and Gen Xers, don&rsquo;t work with Millennial workers. This is particularly true of the performance review. The performance review as practiced by most companies is failing Millennials for five main reasons:</p><h3> 1. It&rsquo;s infrequent.</h3><p> <br/> Millennial workers  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/why-millennials-need-constant-feedback-2014-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   crave constant feedback  </a> </u> . While older generations may have been fine with an annual review, Millennials want to know how they&rsquo;re doing on a continual basis. Frequent feedback enables them to keep tabs on their careers, making adjustments as needed to get them where they want to go.</p><h3> 2. It&rsquo;s impersonal.</h3><p> <br/> Millennial workers have ambition, and they set high expectations for themselves. Unless their  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.talentguard.com/are-your-performance-reviews-paying-lip-service-to-your-performance-needs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   performance reviews  </a> </u>  address their individual strengths and discuss how their current position and performance will affect their personal goals, the feedback won&rsquo;t feel relevant.</p><h3> 3. It lacks a career path.</h3><p> <br/> Unlike Baby Boomer workers, Millennial workers are highly mobile in their careers. They don&rsquo;t expect stability, and they don&rsquo;t want it. Instead, they want managers and feedback that help prepare them for new challenges, positions, and roles &ndash;  <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-work/assets/reshaping-the-workplace.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   preferably ones they can jump into quickly  </u>  . </a></p><h3> 4. It&rsquo;s unconnected to training.</h3><p> <br/> Millennial workers expect rapid progression in their careers, and they value learning from mentors. If their review doesn&rsquo;t include avenues for growth and ways to improve their performance, they&rsquo;re going to feel short-changed.</p><h3> 5. It doesn&rsquo;t bring the right kind of value.</h3><p> <br/> Millennial workers are less motivated by traditional incentives than previous generations, and many would prefer more flexibility and a better work/life balance than conventional rewards. A review &ndash; and company &ndash; that doesn&rsquo;t take their personal preferences for encouragement and praise into account won&rsquo;t satisfy or motivate them.</p><p> Companies who want to increase Millennial engagement and reap the vast benefits these workers can bring to their organization may need to reconsider the way they currently assess and review employees. A systematic competency-based approach that blends performance, employee aspirations, and career development may be the answer.

I&rsquo;d love your input.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> First, I had to check if she wanted input or if she just wanted congratulations and for me to echo what everyone else told her, &ldquo;great idea!&rdquo;</p><p> She insisted that she was more than open to feedback, she needed it. Either her idea was absolute perfection, or nobody was willing to step up to the plate with any truth that could be potentially hurtful&hellip; or helpful.</p><p> Instead of pretending that my feedback was wiser, or held any more weight than her efforts and instincts, I not only shared my opinions but also asked her questions. Lots of &rsquo;em.</p><p> Questions are powerful only when you take a beat to reflect. It&rsquo;s easy to give the answer that you want to be true, but just isn&rsquo;t at the moment. Believe it or not, we try to fool ourselves by glossing over the stuff that&rsquo;s less than perfect and we look for reasons to prove ourselves right.</p><p> Nobody is there watching you. Put aside your eagerness to get the business going and check in with your heart, gut and mind.</p><h3> <strong>  Wait on applying to Shark Tank&hellip; Ask Yourself 15 Questions Before You Start Your New Business </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Why this? </strong> <br/> There has to be a reason you picked this out of the millions of other businesses that you could start.</p><p> <strong>  What problem are you solving? </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s nice to have a business but to be profitable, you need to solve a problem for your buyer. Ask yourself if it&rsquo;s a substantial problem that someone would pay to fix or just a minor annoyance that they can easily research and solve on their own.</p><p> <strong>  What separates you from the competition? </strong> <br/> Throwing your hat in the me-too ring and depending on SEO to take you across the finish line won&rsquo;t get you where you want to go. Know your competition and don&rsquo;t compete on price alone.</p><p> <strong>  Why should your customer change their current behavior? </strong> <br/> Yeah, you think your idea rocks, but it will require your customer to jump through a few hoops that you think are perfectly reasonable. Are you sure they&rsquo;ll be motivated to change? Why?</p><p> <strong>  Does your approach make it easy for your business or easy for your customer? </strong> <br/> Structuring your business so it&rsquo;s easy to manage makes a lot of sense. However, you&rsquo;re there to serve your customer, not for your customer to bend and weave to serve you. Find a way to achieve both.</p><p> <strong>  How long of a runway do you have to get profitable? </strong> <br/> If you need an ROI in days, weeks or even a month or two, you may be putting yourself and your business at risk. Give yourself some room for ramp up.</p><p> <strong>  Will this be your sole income or a side hustle? </strong> <br/> It comes down to how much time and attention you&rsquo;re willing to invest. Be honest with yourself where this falls on your priority list.</p><p> <strong>  Are you committed to going all-in at some point? </strong> <br/> If you want it to be your full-time gig, and potentially your employees too, how will you know it&rsquo;s time? Also, if you&rsquo;re considering hiring someone else to run it full time while you work in your current job, it should tell you a lot.</p><p> <strong>  Is your target (location) market one that you know and understand? </strong> <br/> Most people start their business where they live, work and know. If you&rsquo;ve heard that a particular location is a sweet local for your biz but you&rsquo;ve never been, go now.</p><p> <strong>  How much are you willing to sacrifice to make it work? </strong> <br/> Starting up a business is hard work. There may be marketers telling you that they started with $0 and were making $200,000 a year within three months. You do the math. There are no magic businesses and all take sacrifices from you and your family. Don&rsquo;t forget,  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/what-it-really-takes-to-succeed/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   success takes more than hustle.  </a> </u></p><p> <strong>  How passionate are you about this idea and how excited are you about the idea of starting a business? </strong> <br/> Stop here and linger for a while. A lot of businesses can make a profit; it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you want to get up in the morning and eat, breathe and sleep your new venture.</p><p> <strong>  Before you plan for rapid expansion, how will you know it&rsquo;s sustainable? </strong> <br/> It&rsquo;s great to have plans for franchises around the country but don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself. Beyond the P&amp;L, what will your money, life and business need to look like to know that it&rsquo;s working for you?</p><p> <strong>  What are you most afraid will happen? </strong> <br/> Nobody likes to think about worse case scenario when trying to be positive about the future, but it&rsquo;s necessary.  <a href=\"http://www.laraequy.com/blog/personal-leadership/the-positive-side-of-negative-thinking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Mental toughness expert LaRae Quy  </u>    </a> teaches to be a positive thinker by embracing the possibility of failure.</p><p> <strong>  What is the best possible outcome? </strong> <br/> Have a  <u>  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/life-and-leadership-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   big, robust, and tangible vision of the future  </a> </u> .

Perhaps we hired that PR firm on their promise to do amazing things. Or we invested in a &ldquo;home-run idea&rdquo; that we heard about.</p><h3> When we look back on some of our choices and decisions we wonder later &ndash; what was I thinking?</h3><p> <br/> I think part of the explanation for poor decision-making comes down to us moving too quickly through our workload to get everything done. In our attempt to do more, we may not stop to think, consider and fully evaluate the decisions we are about to make. We rely instead upon gut reactions that sometimes work out, but also can have very negative repercussions.</p><p> My 18-year-old son summed this up nicely by explaining a decision made by one of his hockey teammates on spring break by declaring, <strong>  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad idea if you don&rsquo;t think about it, Mom.&rdquo; </strong> And there it was.

We deliver comprehensive financial planning and wealth management solutions to families, entrepreneurs, and executives. Based upon our experience, we provide a simple framework to help you make the most-informed decisions when considering your own firm.</p><h3> <strong>  1. How do you want to service your clients? Investment management or financial planning? </strong></h3>As a CFA charterholder or CFA candidate, you may have a natural affinity for portfolio construction and asset allocation. It is important to note that creating an investment portfolio in isolation is not the same as <u> <a href=\"https://www.blueoceanglobalwealth.com/pdf/The-Power-of-Financial-Planning.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial planning </a></u>. Determine if you want to simply focus on the investments or if you identify with a financial planning process, which integrates additional areas of financial life above portfolio management, including taxes, insurance, liabilities, budgeting, succession planning, estate planning, and charitable giving.<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/11/Financial-Planning.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Identify Your Sources of Revenue\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/11/Financial-Planning.png?resize=584%2C506\"/></a>Source: <u> <a href=\"https://www.blueoceanglobaltech.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Blue Ocean Global Technology </a></u><h3> <strong>  2. What is your future revenue model, advisory fees or brokerage commissions? </strong></h3>The products and services you offer, and associated compensation received, will determine the optimal legal structure for your business.<strong> Advisory/Fees:</strong><li> Investment Management Fees</li><li> Financial Planning Fees</li><li> Consulting Fees</li>If you prefer fee-based or fee-only compensation, you will need to join an existing or create a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). If you earn income from fees, you are considered an investment adviser. Depending on their size, investment advisers have to register with either the SEC or the state securities agency where they maintain their principal place of business. For the most part, investment advisers who manage $100 million or more in client assets must register with the SEC. If they manage less than $100 million, they must register with the state securities agency. Please note that fees may be structured as a flat amount or a percentage of assets under management.<strong> Brokerage/Commissions:</strong><li> Mutual Fund 12b-1 Fees</li><li> Life Insurance</li><li> Long-term Care Insurance</li><li> Term Insurance</li><li> Variable Annuities</li><li> Fixed Annuities</li><li> Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</li><li> Structured Products</li>If you plan to receive commissions, you will need to affiliate with an existing broker-dealer to offer such products, which requires passing licensing exams, such as the Series 7.In forming <u> <a href=\"https://www.blueoceanglobalwealth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Blue Ocean Global Wealth </a></u>, we sought a more comprehensive product offering and anticipated receiving compensation from both fees and commissions. As a result, dual or hybrid registration was most appropriate. Advantages include:<li> Flexibility to serve clients from a brokerage and advisory standpoint.</li><li> Enhanced ability to consolidate client relationships.</li><li> Versatility to provide options for both retail and institutional clients.</li><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/11/Transition-Plan.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Identify Your Sources of Revenue\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/files/2015/11/Transition-Plan.png?resize=584%2C380\"/></a>Source: <u> <a href=\"https://www.blueoceanglobaltech.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Blue Ocean Global Technology </a></u><h3> <strong>  3. Consult a reputable compliance provider. </strong></h3>Following the compliance rules and regulations is fundamental to the daily viability of your business. Navigating the regulatory landscape, at the state and federal level, can be complex and time consuming. Maintaining an in-house compliance department is often neither practical nor feasible. Establish best practices from the onset of your business so that you can focus on engaging clients and strategic partners.<h3> <strong>  4. Develop a business and marketing plan with a detailed timeline to prepare you for when you go live. </strong></h3>Every business, particularly within the financial services industry, is unique. Your business model (RIA vs. broker-dealer vs. hybrid/dual registration) will dictate next steps and resources available to support your vision. Begin with the end in mind and recognize that your business will evolve as your realize success and learn from mistakes. Below are some of the key factors we recommend you consider:<strong> Business Incorporation:</strong> If forming an RIA, name and register your entity after determining the right legal structure.<strong> Custodian:</strong> Selecting a reputable custodian is critical. Bernie Madoff, for example, held client assets in custody and was therefore able to manipulate values and account statements. We selected the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), through their subsidiary Pershing Advisory Solutions, because they are the world&rsquo;s largest custodian. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/06/17/bny-mellon-adds-770-billion-to-its-custody-assets-with-t-rowe-price-deal/\" target=\"_blank\"> BNY administers more than $29 trillion</a>, or 20% of the world&rsquo;s securities. We also found their global presence in key markets, such as London and India, advantageous for our long-term strategic plan.This line from history resonates with me and validates the importance of planning.<strong> &ldquo;Success depends upon previous preparation, and without such preparation there is sure to be failure.&rdquo; &mdash; Confucius</strong><h3> Prepare for the opportunity. No matter how prepared you are, you may never feel you have prepared enough.</h3>When you have a flexible framework, it&rsquo;s easier to stay focused on reaching your goals. An integrated plan will help you measure short- and medium-term progress toward realizing your long-term vision.Just as portfolio management may stipulate that an asset manager implement an &ldquo;active&rdquo; strategy within the guidelines of the investment policy statement, entrepreneurship will require you to adjust your plan on an ongoing basis. Educate yourself to be as knowledgeable as possible.<h3> By understanding your options, you&rsquo;ll be better prepared to make informed decisions.</h3>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-10 17:58:51.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-10 17:58:51.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_xq6SRgb.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/four-steps-to-starting-your-own-advisory-firm/\", \"post_id\": \"9741\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-10 17:58:51\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-10 17:58:51\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"four-steps-to-starting-your-own-advisory-firm\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9740\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4681\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Four-Steps-to-Starting-Your-Own-Advisory-Firm.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1736\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457732700,"author_id":421,"chart_url":""}

Here are 10 strategies to rekindle your motivational fire!</p><p> Around this time of year, many of us tend to feel a bit drained. The excitement of the new year and all its promises has worn off, the grayness of winter begins to wear on us, and we might realize that we're approaching the end of first quarter with nary a sign of progress on our goals. It's easy to feel dips in energy, passion, and all-around mojo.</p><p> I experienced this myself not long ago and was a bit befuddled to find my 'usual tricks' not working. After some experimentation, soul-searching, a breakthrough map, and an enlightening conversation with my coach, I played with some different ways to get back on track. I want to share some with you, just in case you've lost a bit of your mojo, too!</p><h3> 1. Focus. </h3><p> In my case, I realized I was spreading myself a bit too thin, personally and professionally. I reigned things back in, honed in on the 2-3 areas that really matter the most right now, and focused time and energy to move them forward. </p><h3> 2. Connect with someone new.</h3><p> Who have you met recently that you want to get to know better? Whose work do you admire? Set up a coffee or lunch date and gain fresh perspective.</p><h3> 3. Help someone else.</h3><p> One of the first items I ever cross-stitched was the saying, \"Nothing strengthens the heart more than reaching down and lifting up another.\" It's so true. Regain your mojo by helping someone else gain theirs.</p><h3> 4. Outsource something.</h3><p> I discovered a task that drained my energy even thinking about it - and yet I was still doing it. I delegated it to someone else and instantly felt my load lightened.</p><h3> 5. Clean up your routine.</h3><p> Take note of your mornings, weekdays, and evenings. Have you gotten squishy in your supportive routines? Recharge them - or at least one of them - with vigor. Rekindled discipline can be surprisingly motivating!</p><h3> 6. Go away.</h3><p> Take a breather in a new environment. Whether a week-long vacation or just packing up a project and heading to a gorgeous coffee shop for an afternoon, changing scenery can work absolute wonders. I have spent time lately at our local botanical gardens and have felt inspired, productive, and peaceful each time.</p><h3> 7. Run.</h3><p> Or go for a brisk walk. Or bike, or do some jumping jacks, or something else that gets your body moving and your heart pumping.</p><h3> 8. Step. </h3><p> Outside of your comfort zone, that is. Embark on an adventure or try something new and healthfully daring. Use the adrenaline and fear to your advantage.</p><h3> 9. Infuse yourself with goodness. </h3><p> Looking at the three major aspects of life - body, mind, and spirit - ask how you can \"fill your bucket\" with positivity. Answers might include listening to inspiring podcasts, reading uplifting books, eating nourishing foods, watching only positive movies, regularly attending a worship service, getting together with people who \"get you\" and make you laugh.</p><h3> 10. Ask for help.</h3><p> You don't have to go it alone. Seeking help is a sign of courage. Remember that most times, people don't know you need help unless you ask for it. Take that step.  </p><p> When you feel a dip in your mojo, keep the always-helpful phrase in mind: This too shall pass. </p><p> But maybe make it pass a little quicker with one of these tips or something you brainstorm on your own!</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-10 18:24:03.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-10 18:24:03.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_Er619zt.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/10-ways-to-get-your-fire-back/\", \"post_id\": \"9743\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-10 18:24:03\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-10 18:24:03\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"10-ways-to-get-your-fire-back\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9742\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4682\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10-Ways-To-Get-Your-Fire-Back.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"2169\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457712000,"author_id":150,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4513,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Separating Our Financial Heads from Our Political Hearts","link":"separating-our-financial-heads-from-our-political-hearts","source_link":null,"content":"<h3> The 2016 presidential election is coming at us like stampeding buffalo, and it seems there&rsquo;s no reprieve from the rhetoric.</h3><p> <br/> Among the claims on both sides of the campaign trail is that electing [insert candidate name here] will boost the stock market, improve the economy, and put more cash in your wallet. But the question, as always, is who&rsquo;s speaking the truth? If (and this is certainly a hypothetical question) your #1 concern when you walk into that voting booth is the future strength of your portfolio, how should you vote in November?</p><p> Back in 2003, when GW Bush was in his second year in the Oval Office, I met with a new client at the University Club in Montgomery, Alabama, where Stephen was a professor at the University of Alabama. After our initial greetings and social niceties, the conversation quickly shifted to how much Stephen &ldquo;hated Bush&rdquo; and that he couldn&rsquo;t see investing in the stock market as long as Bush was in office. &ldquo;As soon as a democrat is back in office, he&rsquo;ll straighten out the economy and restore order to this mess, but I&rsquo;m not putting in a dime.&rdquo; If you dive into the details, there&rsquo;s much more to the picture&mdash;so much, in fact, that it&rsquo;s quite evident that regardless of who is the sitting President, the stock market is driven by well-led companies who create investment value&mdash;not by who&rsquo;s in the White House.</p><h3> Stephen&rsquo;s verbal tirade was enough for me to know we would not be a good fit.</h3><p> <br/> I declined to work with him; his thinking was far too restrictive and unproductive. Not only was that a wise choice for me personally (I cherish my freedom to work with clients who think rationally and value my advice), but Stephen&rsquo;s theory would not have delivered professional value either. At that time, Stephen had all his retirement assets in safe, interest-bearing money markets and treasuries paying about 4%. Since that meeting more than 12 years ago, interest rates declined to 1.8% on 10-year treasuries. Assuming Stephen stuck to his guns and stayed out of the market, his average return over this period would have been just 2.9%. The Dow average closed at 10,173 on August 31, 2003, and jumped past 17,000 this past Monday on March 7, 2016. That&rsquo;s an annual gain of 6% plus 2% for dividends or a total of 8%. Stephen&rsquo;s decision to restrict investment options influenced by politics caused him to lose out on returns that might have been 250% better.</p><h3> Separating our financial heads from our political hearts is a difficult challenge for most of us.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  We&rsquo;re not alone. </strong> We&rsquo;ve all seen one business sector or another spend massive amounts of money to promote a specific candidate because they believe that candidate&rsquo;s agenda will have a direct impact on their particular industry or the economy overall. But clearly they&rsquo;re not paying attention to the data either.</p><p> Even in the most heated political climate, and regardless which party holds office, the markets seem to function pretty well. In fact, historically, the markets have tended to do quite well during political gridlock&mdash;the most recent illustration being that the DOW has doubled since the bottom of the Great Recession in 2009. So despite all the dysfunction and animosity filling our political system, the economy seems to be operating by its own rules.</p><p> Thank goodness, considering that our political history has been contentious since its beginnings. On July 11, 1804, in a duel after a long and bitter rivalry, Aaron Burr, the sitting vice-president, killed Alexander Hamilton, the former secretary of the treasury. And both men had been in duels before&mdash;Hamilton himself having participated in at least 10 known duels before the one that ended his own rather contentious history.</p><h3> Of course, I&rsquo;m not espousing dueling pistols to resolve political conflicts.</h3><p> <br/> But I do recommend taking a lesson from Stephen: no matter who you&rsquo;d love to see in the White House next January (and I urge you to vote with your heartand your head), keep your investments out of the picture. Invest based on economic reality&mdash;not on media speculation about who may be running the country and what that supposedly means for the economy and the stock market. Your portfolio will thank you in the end.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-10 18:47:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-10 18:47:25.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_5NhwATk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/separating-our-financial-heads-from-our-political-hearts/\", \"post_id\": \"9745\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-10 18:47:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-10 18:47:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"separating-our-financial-heads-from-our-political-hearts\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9744\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4683\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Separating-Our-Financial-Heads-from-Our-Political-Hearts.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"801\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457686800,"author_id":184,"chart_url":""}

Elite RIA firms that earn peer-reviewed CEFEX Certification, achieve public recognition for their investment fiduciary excellence, a very important differentiator for clients. CEFEX Certified firms grow faster &ndash; nearly twice as fast as non-certified RIA firms.</p><p> Certification is also a chance for firms to see where they have opportunities for improvement, or uncover a gap  &ndash; a risk that the firm can address now, before it causes a problem.</p><p> <strong>  Here are a handful of the prudent practices I see at firms that have earned CEFEX Certification </strong> . The prudent practices are outlined in the handbook, &ldquo; <a href=\"https://www.fi360.com/main/pdf/handbook_advisor.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Prudent Practices for Investment Advisors  </u>  , </a> &rdquo; available at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fi360.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.fi360.com  </a> </u> , and substantiated with discussions of regulation and law. </p><h3> The basic framework forms a four-part circle: Organize, Formalize, Implement and Monitor.</h3><p> <br/> On days when clients need their advisers most, a few simple prudent practices can make all the difference for client and adviser.</p><p> <strong>  Elite, certified firms make sure clients are set for both tranquil and challenging markets: </strong></p><li> They already have a written, signed agreement and Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for each client, that discusses the client&rsquo;s time horizon, risk tolerance, objectives, appropriate asset allocation and monitoring and replacement criteria.</li><li> They keep these in client&rsquo;s files, along with implementation notes and monitoring reports with review notes.</li><li> Their clients&rsquo; portfolios are diversified, according to each one&rsquo;s signed IPS.</li><li> The portfolios are implemented with appropriate asset allocation (and documented) expertise, skill and due diligence, according to their IPS.</li><li> They conduct regular portfolio reviews, to monitor investment performance and costs against appropriate peers and indexes, rebalance on a regular basis according to their criteria, and replace when necessary. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  In times of market stress, they can help clients keep calm and carry on: </strong></p><li> They stay in touch as many clients as possible via email, phone, or announcement.  These can be very straightforward conversations, such as:  &ldquo;In accordance with your IPS, we&rsquo;ve diversified your portfolio so that when some assets like equities are volatile, others will normally be more stable. You are appropriately allocated across asset types, in line with the IPS. This gives you your best chance for success over the long term. What is on your mind?&rdquo;</li><li> When speaking or emailing with individual clients, they make sure to document what they&rsquo;ve discussed, when, any decisions or next steps, and why. Certified RIA firms keep brief notes, reports and other documentation in the client&rsquo;s file so if there&rsquo;s any question later they can refer to the time, place circumstances, recommendations and any next steps.</li><li> These client notes can be short &ndash; but they are very important, especially if a client forgets what&rsquo;s been discussed, recommended, and why:</li><li> SW Sue Brown re her jt act w Ted, they have long time horizon; advised no change right now &amp; will touch base on next steps in 1-2 weeks (sooner if necessary).</li><li> SW Bob Jones, wanted to go to cash; discussed his IPS, noted he has some cash for immediate needs and we may want to make some rebalancing adjustments to his portfolio as the dust settles, but recommended not doing that today. He agreed to sit tight a few days. Advised I will check in next wk, and to call me if needs to speak sooner.</li><li> Dr. Jo Boone noted that some of the individual stocks in her mad money account were a concern &ndash; that&rsquo;s the account she directs on her own, which I reminded her. She wanted to trim there, but not necessarily in her other portfolios we manage.  When I asked if she needed the cash from the self-directed account right away, she noted there&rsquo;s an estimated tax pmt in 2 wks; I noted there&rsquo;s a position she could harvest to offset some gains, and she wants to go ahead.  Order sent to trading. <br/>  </li><h3> RIA firms that have prudent practices in place build trust with clients because they deserve that trust.</h3><p> <br/> When they make the effort to have an independent, third party come in and verify that for clients, it is very meaningful for clients and prospective clients.  When an RIA firm has a well-thought-out, repeatable set of practices in place, clients are better served, the firm is better managed, and has more control over all operations, from client acquisition to investment management or manager selection, to compliance, back office and cyber security.  When firms are well managed, they keep more revenue, and tend to have better client outcomes over the long term.</p><p> And when markets get challenging, they are set to help clients get through them.</p><p>  </p>","channel":21,"channel_url":21,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-10 19:18:38.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-10 19:18:38.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_lIhJDt5.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/5-ways-top-ria-firms-help-clients-when-markets-are-challenging/\", \"post_id\": \"9749\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-10 19:18:38\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-10 19:18:38\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"5-ways-top-ria-firms-help-clients-when-markets-are-challenging\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9748\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4685\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5-Ways-Top-RIA-Firms-Help-Clients-When-Markets-Are-Challenging.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"642\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457718300,"author_id":265,"chart_url":""}

These moments often beg us to rethink how we went about our routines and how we may have added our personal touch to our decisions and actions.</p><p> We may even ask ourselves:</p><li> &ldquo;Where did I go wrong?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Why did I approach the situation that way?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;When will I be seen for the leader I am?&rdquo;</li><p> Those questions are beyond unhelpful. Instead we need to take a healthy look inside of us and ask:</p><li> &ldquo;Did I create the best outcome I could?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Did I present my strongest and most creative product?&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Am I projecting my authentic self?&rdquo;</li><p> In her mesmerizing book,  Big Magic- Creative Living Beyond Fear , Elizabeth Gilbert argues that when we dump our fears and remain committed to our decisions without constant worry, we are able to create well-crafted outcomes.</p><p> &ldquo;You can measure your worth by your dedication to your path, not by your successes or failures,&rdquo; Gilbert writes.</p><p> Here are seven ways to dump fears and remain commited to crete leadership success:</p><h3> 1. KNOW YOUR WORTH <br/>  </h3><p> If we allow everyone around us to decide if we are capable or strong enough in our field, we will spin in a circle. We can&rsquo;t give others the power to dictate our worth; only we should be determining that. If we don&rsquo;t receive the promotion we so deserve, we can definitely present our case to persuade a change in the decision. But if that doesn&rsquo;t work, we can&rsquo;t let it derail our career or make us think less of ourselves. We need to rethink our next move.</p><h3> 2. LEAVE PERFECTION BEHIND <br/>  </h3><p> According to Elizabeth Gilbert: &ldquo;In order to stay in the game, you must let go of your fantasy of perfection. We don&rsquo;t have time for perfect.&rdquo; To be a creative leader we recognize when to stop re-doing and just taking action.</p><li> Striving for perfection can often lead us empty handed at the end</li><li> Perfection is really a myth and should be deleted from our vocabulary</li><li> Imperfection means we are human</li><li> Perfection can delay our deadlines and derail our commitments</li><h3> 3. DON&rsquo;T WORRY WHAT OTHERS THINK <br/>  </h3><p> Of course we need to be aware of what our team members and colleagues think, but not at the expense of not creating the work we choose to create. When we find ourselves overly concerned with how others judge our choices or decisions, then it&rsquo;s time to put some blinders on. One of my favorite sayings to myself when outside noise is getting me down is: &ldquo;So what.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. BE CURIOUS <br/>  </h3><p> Another one of Elizabeth Gilbert&rsquo;s strategies to staying creative and in the flow, is to turn fear into curiosity. Instead of becoming paralyzed with anxiety if we feel uncertain of how to proceed. Swap being frightened for learning more about the issues. If a team member is ridiculing you, explore why this is happening. Maybe you are part of their frustration and don&rsquo;t even realize it. If the project you are working on seems dull and missing some energy, figure out what to change.</p><h3> 5. HAVE THE COURAGE TO FOLLOW YOUR CHOICES <br/>  </h3><p> Taking a risk with our creative endeavors can feel uncomfortable but think about the flip side of not trying.</p><li> We may not see our greatest work</li><li> We aren&rsquo;t being honest of what we can possibly contribute</li><li> We may be letting our team down</li><li> We aren&rsquo;t following through on our vision</li><p> Just remember to stay disciplined and not give up easily when things get tough.</p><h3> 6. GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO MAKE CHANGES <br/>  </h3><p> Yes we are allowed to change our minds and change our direction! If we feel ourselves being drawn towards a different path, walk forward and try it. If we see a project isn&rsquo;t playing out with the data you received, find new information. If we need to add a different department&rsquo;s perspective, just reach out and ask.</p><h3> 7. NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL <br/>  </h3><p> Elizabeth Gilbert writes about the difference between authenticity and originality. She claims nothing is really original and that when we add our unique perspective to a creative choice, we are making it authentically &ldquo;us&rdquo;. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to piggy-back or expand on an idea that you have already heard or read about. In the end, you are you and your creative juices cultivate authenticity.</p><p> How do you add creativity to your leadership?

{"original_id":4517,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"10 Tips to Get More Referrals That Turn into Clients","link":"10-tips-to-get-more-referrals-that-turn-into-clients","source_link":null,"content":"<p> When it comes to generating new business, most professional services firms rely on referrals. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/2015-professional-services-marketing-priorities\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   according to our study of 530 professional services firms  </a> </u> , generating referrals ranked highest in terms of current marketing priorities.</p><p> But sadly,most of that marketing effort may be destined to fail.</p><p> Our recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/referral-marketing-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Referral Marketing Study  </a> </u>  exposed an interesting truth. Much of what referral marketing gurus preach&mdash;from attending networking events to asking for referrals&mdash;is ineffective, or simply wrong.</p><p> There are ways to ensure you keep the referrals coming in. Here are some of our favorite research-backed tips.</p><h3> 1. Stop asking for referrals.</h3><p> <br/> Asking clients and fellow professionals is a very common piece of advice from those referral gurus. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t always work in the professional services context.</p><p> When we asked more than 1,100 referral sources (professional who make referrals) what drove them to make a referrer,  we found that a meager  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/should-you-be-asking-for-referrals-the-answer-may-surprise-you\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2% would make a referral when asked  </a> </u> .</p><p> Why so low? The answer is actually quite simple and rather intuitive.</p><p> You&rsquo;re asking for a favor and giving nothing in return. There is no pay-off, especially when you consider that making a referral can be risky for the referrer. They are sticking their neck out and putting their reputation on the line.</p><p> There is another reason to stop asking for referrals from clients. When you ask, you can easily switch from a trusted service provider dedicated to their interest to a &ldquo;salesperson.&rdquo; That can be a vibe that is hard to shake.  </p><p> So, if you can&rsquo;t ask, how can you generate a steady stream of business-building referrals? We actually found that more than 80% of firms actually get referrals from people they have not worked with or even met.</p><p> Read on.</p><h3> 2. Share your expertise by speaking at industry events.</h3><p> <br/> We found that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/raising-your-visibility-how-to-get-started-with-speaking-engagements\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   speaking engagements  </a> </u>  are a top source of referrals.</p><p> The reason is speaking at conferences and other industry events raises your visibility as an expert. You may even find that some attendees approach you directly. Like a kind of &ldquo;self referral.&rdquo;</p><p> More importantly, others in the audience will learn of your expertise, and when asked by a client or colleague, will be able to make the referral based on what they learned from you.</p><h3> 3. Write educational articles and blog posts.</h3><p> <br/> Another great way to get non-clients to make referrals is to educate. Just remember that your audience for your educational content is prospective clients not fellow professionals. For maximum effect publish or post in publications read by your target audience and their influencers.</p><h3> 4. Give more referrals.</h3><p> <br/> People often make a referral to a firm that sent a referral their way. So, to get more referrals, give more referrals. This remarkably consistent relationship is shown in Figure 1.</p><p> Figure 1. Reciprocity&rsquo;s affect on referral generation</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/uploads/blog/Reciprocity.png\"/></p><p> The impact of reciprocity is evident when looking at the top 20% of referral makers compared to the bottom 20%. Professionals who make more referrals receive more referrals.</p><p> Reciprocity works well, but only if you are in a position to give a lot of referrals to someone who can make the appropriate referrals to you. Make sure both conditions are true before your invest your time, resources or reputation.</p><p> SEE ALSO:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/top-7-referral-marketing-ideas-for-professional-services-firms#sthash.zzDHpd7O.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Top 7 Referral Marketing Ideas for Professional Services Firms  </a> </u></p><h3> 5. Deepen social relationships with selected referral sources.</h3><p> <br/> Referrals can come from social relationships and friendships, but only if the referrer is familiar with your expertise. The notion of meeting new people and developing friendships to get referrals is destined to fail if it is not based on understanding your expertise.</p><p> That is why we suggest you concentrate on those individuals who both know your expertise (such as a client or fellow professional that you have worked with) and are in a position to make referrals to you.</p><h3> 6. Conduct an industry-leading research study.</h3><p> <br/> Professionals who are seen as industry trend setters are in the best position to get referrals. And among the best ways to demonstrate your thought leadership is to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/blog/story/what-every-managing-partner-needs-to-know-about-b2b-research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   conduct a research study  </a> </u>  that addresses an important industry issue.</p><p> If the research is well publicized it can become a significant magnet for new referrals.</p><h3> 7. Promote the successes of clients.</h3><p> <br/> One of the ways to communicate your expertise is to showcase the clients you serve and the results that you produce. Just be mindful of the limits to what can or should be disclosed.</p><p> To avoid such limitations, invite your client to speak at an industry event where the work you have done together is described by the client. Such engagements are actually beneficial for both you and your client. They gain exposure, your gain credibility and referrals. It&rsquo;s a win-win.</p><p> Also consider promoting the successes of your high-profile client in an article or a video case study. Maybe nominate them for a prestigious award. If the story is compelling, potential clients will ask your client about you. These questions often turn into referrals.</p><h3> 8. Avoid untargeted networking.</h3><p> <br/> Most professional services providers will go to any number of networking events. These can be costly because of the time commitment involved. But in our referral marketing research, we found that going to such events is likely to produce insufficient results.</p><p> Only about 5.5% of referrals come from someone you&rsquo;ve meet at such an untargeted networking event. You are much better of attending an event attended by your target audience, especially if you speak at the event&mdash;remember Tip #2.</p><h3> 9. Be crystal clear about how you can best help potential clients.</h3><p> <br/> Getting the referral is only the start. Once you get a referral you need to keep it. And to keep it, you need the referred prospect to start a conversation. Unfortunately, more than half of referrals never make it to this next critical step.</p><p> According to another  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/referral-marketing-for-professional-services-firms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hinge study  </a> </u> , potential clients rule out providers they have been referred to without talking with them. When we asked why, the number one reason given was a lack of understanding how the referred firm could help them (see Figure 2). That is why you must be very clear about what you do, who you do it for, and why clients would choose you in all your communication channels.</p><p> Think that&rsquo;s obvious? Think again. Just look at professional services websites&mdash;the most likely first stop when someone gets a referral. Often the language on these sites is vague and general. In an attempt to appeal to everyone, such sites end up being appealing to no one.</p><p> Figure 2. Why buyers rule out a referral</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/uploads/blog/Why_buyers_rule_out_refferals.png\"/></p><h3> 10.

Abandon &ldquo;want more&rdquo; and &ldquo;learn more&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> These are the easiest ways to start calls to action. And while there is nothing wrong with them, there are better alternatives. Choose verbs that have strong, clear actions.</p><p> Here are some examples:</p><li> Choose</li><li> Protect your</li><li> Boost</li><li> Find a</li><li> Explore</li><li> Build</li><li> Create</li><li> Lead</li><li> Discover</li><li> Click</li><li> Craft</li><li> Achieve</li><li> Reach</li><li> Overcome</li><li> Sign up</li><li> Download</li><p> There are plenty more but you get the point.</p><h3> 2. You can &ndash; and should &ndash; have more than one call to action <br/>  </h3><p> Direct your readers to blog posts, brochures, calculators and whatever else you can. Calls to action are one of the greatest ways to continue and expand the conversation, as well as add more value.</p><p> In a brochure, consider having a call to action on every page. On a website, you can write in-line calls to action or include them as sidebars and call outs.</p><h3> 3. Use them to answer potential questions <br/>  </h3><p> Generally, calls to action answer just one question, &ldquo;What do I do next?&rdquo;</p><p> But they can answer any number of questions. What questions/objections could your readers have? You can also use your calls to action to answer questions and overcome objections.</p><p> For example, if you are writing about the cost of retirement, you reader may ask, &ldquo;How did they come up with that number?&rdquo; Answer your reader with a call to action that points to a retirement savings calculator. It could look like this: How much will you need in retirement? Check out our retirement calculator today and discover how much you&rsquo;ll need.</p><p> The best way to find out what you need is to put yourself in your readers&rsquo; shoes. If you have more resources to help them or more answers that they may be looking for, use a call to action to help them take the next step.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-10 20:02:01.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-10 20:02:01.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_Kc6qjBk.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/calls-to-action-does-your-web-copy-follow-these-3-ideas/\", \"post_id\": \"9755\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-10 20:02:01\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-10 20:02:01\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"calls-to-action-does-your-web-copy-follow-these-3-ideas\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9754\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4688\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Calls-to-Action-Does-Your-Web-Copy-Implement-These-3-Ideas.jpeg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"650\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457686800,"author_id":29,"chart_url":""}

They take  <a href=\"http://www.greatplacetowork.com/our-trust-approach/what-is-a-great-workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  two perspectives on the definition </a> , citing trust developed through management credibility as a key driving force.</p><p> <strong>  A great workplace from the employee's viewpoint is one where they: </strong></p><li> TRUST the people they work for;</li><li> Have PRIDE in what they do; </li><li> and ENJOY the people they work with.</li><p> <br/> <strong>  A great workplace from the manager's viewpoint is one where they: </strong></p><li> ACHIEVE ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES; </li><li> With employees who GIVE THEIR PERSONAL BEST; </li><li> and WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM / FAMILY in an environment of TRUST  <br/>  </li><p> There are nine practice areas where leaders and managers create an environment of trust. Great workplaces achieve organizational goals by inspiring, speaking, and listening. They have employees who give their personal best by thanking, developing, and caring. And they work together as a team / family by hiring, celebrating, and sharing.</p><p> Do any of those describe the organization you work for? As an employee, do you feel your employer cares about you and adheres to these tenets of a great workplace and a great experience?</p><p> Employee experience on its own is an important area on which every company should focus. It impacts employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention. It also impacts the customer experience. I've  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2013/12/this-trumps-customer-experience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   written  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/09/the-employee-experience-customer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spoken  </a> </u>  about that many times. </p><p> The real kicker is that when we impact the customer experience through a better employee experience, we also impact the bottom line.

The article talks about the new business model and what they discovered: \"There is a chain of cause and effect running from employee behavior to customer behavior to profits.\" </p><p> Also, it's been reported that organizations in the Best Companies to Work Study for the period 2004 &ndash; 2008 increased their revenues by 94% and their profits by 315%.</p><p> I was delighted to find more evidence of this from Watermark Consulting, the firm that publishes the annual  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.watermarkconsult.net/docs/Watermark-Customer-Experience-ROI-Study.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Customer Experience ROI Study  </a> </u> . They've taken a look at the employee experience leaders based on Great Place to Work findings and charted their performance on the S&amp;P 500 for the last 18 years, from 1997 to 2014. (Unfortunately, there is no laggards list from this source to compare them to, but this is pretty enlightening on its own. I can only imagine that the laggards have polar opposite results, especially if you consider the Customer Experience ROI Study findings.)

Did you spend out-of-pocket costs traveling to interviews or spend money stationery for resumes and cover letters? If so, deducting these items can make a big dent at tax time. And one doesn&rsquo;t have to be officially unemployed to qualify. Searching for a better job, even while fully employed, is perfectly acceptable. Other applicable deductions include food and lodging for overnight stays, cab fares, and employment agency fees.</li><li> If that new job is your first job, any incurred moving expenses may indeed be deductible. To qualify for the deduction, your first job must be 50 miles or more from your previous residence. Those who qualify can deduct the cost of moving and, if you drove your own vehicle for the move, deduct 23 cents (2015) a mile plus parking and tolls.</li><li> While everyone recognizes that necessary medical items like wheelchairs and hearing aids may be deducted, few realize that eyeglasses and contacts also fall into the same category. While designer eyeglasses, or drug store magnifiers, may not seem like medical devices, the IRS does allow these deductions &ndash; a big cost savings at tax time.</li><li> Though we all known charitable contributions are tax deductible &ndash; one of the most common ways that Americans gain tax deductions &ndash; many less obvious acts of charity also qualify, Out-of-pocket charity expenses such as the cost of paint and poster board for a school fundraiser, or the cost of delivering meals or chauffeuring other volunteers can be deducted. Such mileage deductions may be totaled at a rate of 14 cents (2015) per mile plus parking and toll fees. Deductions will require a written acknowledgement from the charity involved.</li><li> Members of the National Guard or military reserve may claim a deduction for travel expenses to drills or meetings. In order to qualify, the service member must travel more than 100 miles from home on an overnight journey. Applicable deductions include lodging, meals, and 57.5 cents (2015) per mile plus parking and toll fees.</li><li> For those employees who have served on juries in the past year, jury duty may represent a taxable deduction. Many employers continue to pay their employees during the time of jury proceedings, but require the employees to turn over jury pay as a recompense for the time away. To even things out, you can deduct the amount you give to your employer. In such cases, the write-off goes on line 36 &ndash; the line totaling up deductions that get their own lines. Add your jury fee total to your other write-offs and write &ldquo;jury pay&rdquo; on the line directly to the left.</li><li> Airline baggage fees are another deduction that is rarely recognized by the American traveling public. All told, these fees can add up to serious costs. If you&rsquo;re self-employed and travelling on business, you can add those costs in as approved business deductions.</li><li> While many tax credits for energy-saving home improvements have expired, the most valuable credits still exist until 2016. These applicable credits will effectively refund 30% of the of alternative energy upgrades such as solar hot water heaters and geothermal heat pumps.</li><li> In most cases, one can only deduct mortgage or student-loan interests if one is legally required to repay the debt. But if you&rsquo;re a non-dependent student who still receives help from mom and dad, you parent&rsquo;s generosity may help you at tax time. If mom and dad pay your loans, the IRS treats the money as a gift to the child who used it to pay the debt. As such, a non-dependent child can qualify to deduct up to $2,500 of student-loan interest paid. Be advised, however, that mom and dad can&rsquo;t claim the interest deduction. Legally, it&rsquo;s not their debt. <br/>  </li><p> Just remember, in order to get the most out of your tax returns, you must stay as organized as possible, and do your research&mdash;no one likes getting audited.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-10 20:49:11.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-10 20:49:11.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_OlBvNwx.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/income-tax-deductions-youve-most-likely-overlooked/\", \"post_id\": \"9758\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-10 20:49:11\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-10 20:49:11\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"income-tax-deductions-youve-most-likely-overlooked\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9757\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4690\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Income-Tax-Deductions-Youve-Probably-Overlooked.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"775\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457686800,"author_id":282,"chart_url":""}

The good news is, I just got assigned a big project that has the potential to give me all kinds of visibility in the company. The bad news is, I've been paired with the least competent person in my department - he is a total disaster. Now I'm terrified that my greatest opportunity is actually going to be my great undoing ... that is, if I don't kill him first :) I need your best tips for working with incompetent people. What do I do?\" </strong></p><p> <strong>  A: </strong> Ouch ... as much as I love this question, I know, only too well, how frustrating this situation can be. We've all been through it and it's one of the most challenging aspects of working on a team. Being forced to work with incompetent people or people who just don't care, can be enough to make you want to go away and hide and write books and blogs for a living :) The situation isn't reserved for corporate life either - college and university are even worse in some ways - your entire grade can depend on you working effectively with a bunch of people you didn't choose to be on your team in the first place. It's extremely frustrating when you feel like you're doing great work but the ultimate outcome or grade is being weighed down by another person's incompetence.</p><p> It's one thing when an incompetent person reports to you - in that case you have some legitimate power to affect their behavior - but what are you supposed to do when you're peers? </p><li> Do all the work yourself to make sure it's good and then share the credit?</li><li> Argue every issue and create an extremely tense working relationship?</li><li> Give up and ask your boss to assign you a new partner?</li><li> Do nothing and risk having a terrible outcome?</li><p> Those all seem like terrible options. And to be honest with you, I haven't found one silver bullet method for completely overcoming this challenge either. What I have learned over the years, are some secret tricks to make the most out of the projects I have to work on with incompetent people. They won't guarantee you a home run, but they will minimize the damage and give you a decent chance to come out on top. </p><h3> Here are my 4 secret tactics for working well with incompetent co-workers:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Volunteer to build the project framework, template or structure. </strong>  Whenever I have to build a group presentation or plan or document with people I feel are not quite up to the task, I make sure to own the initial creation of the template or framework. In the very first project meeting I will volunteer to build out the structure or skeleton for the final deliverable. That can take many forms: the agenda, presentation template, table of contents, plan structure, wire frame etc. If your project doesn't seem to fit with any of these, use your imagination. Every project needs some type of fundamental structure that defines how content or tasks will flow. One quick point of clarity - I'm not necessarily suggesting you volunteer to be the project manager - that is a different role. I'm saying, be the one who builds out the framework for the end deliverable. The reason you want to do this is it gives you the ability, at the very beginning of the project, to eliminate the worst case scenario. We've all had experiences were you assign out a bunch of work to the various members of the project team and then a bunch of total crap comes back and you have to figure out how to piece it together in a cohesive way. That approach is backwards.</p><p> When I'm involved in a team project, I will go so far as to rough-out every slide or section of a document first, with placeholder text describing what should go in each spot. Then I distribute that template for team members to fill out in the exact spots I've highlighted. It results in much higher quality work that is also easier to manage. It might seem like extra work for you but in the end it really isn't since the countless hours normally spent trying to patch a bunch of disconnected work together will now be avoided. Also by owning the structure of the deliverable, you're in control of the basic flow of the work which, in my opinion, is like 80% of the battle in the first place. </p><p> <strong>  2. Decide whether to isolate or own. </strong>  At some point when you're working with incompetent people you will have to decide whether to isolate their incompetence i.e. minimize the damage, or take ownership for everything i.e. do all the work. I have done both over the years. My preference is to find ways to isolate or compartmentalize the impact of the less competent person rather than just take everything over. Doing all the work - something I know many of you have probably opted for in the past - doesn't scale well and it also burns bridges. You might be able to get away with it once in a while, but in the long term people will hate working with you and think you're a controlling jerk. That's not a recipe for success in a company. Also, it goes without saying, the 'do everything\" option requires you to actually do all the work ... and nobody wants that.</p><p> My recommendation is to identify specific parts of the project that have lower exposure or are more isolated from the core pieces, and encourage your less competent team members to work on them. Even in the worst case scenario, where they screw it all up, their low quality work will be quarantined and won't spread into the most important areas of the project. </p><p> <strong>  3. Grow the project team.  </strong> This is a tactic I don't see many people using even though it can be very effective in certain situations. Often you will find yourself on a project team with one or two other people where at least one of them is incompetent. This is pretty standard. Sometimes when I'm in that situation, but I don't feel like I can legitimately take control over the project framework or isolate the less competent people, I will actually try to increase the size of the team itself. The reason I do this is the same reason why you add more mix to your stiff drink ... it dilutes the impact of the offending party (i.e. cheap vodka and/or incompetent team member). It's a way of adding more level heads or sharp minds to the team to reduce the negative impact the incompetent person can have. Most of the time, you won't get push back when you ask to add someone else to the team - it will seem like more hands to help - but really it will be about bringing another rational voice to the table. If you play your cards right, it can lead to more productive meetings, stronger decisions and ultimately a much better result for your project.</p><p> <strong>  4. Focus on helping people, not holding them accountable. </strong>  I talk about this tactic in detail in my  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brendanreid.com/new-page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   book  </a> </u>  so I won't go through a comprehensive review of it now, but it definitely applies well to this situation. Most of the time, when I see people working on projects with less competent team members, they gravitate towards holding them accountable. They criticize their work, hound them when they're late, and talk badly about them to others. I don't do that. Holding people accountable is one of those business truisms that nobody ever questions even though they should. I actually look for the opportunities when most people hold their peers accountable or criticize them. And, instead of holding them accountable, I offer my help and support. This takes a lot of emotional control because more often than not, their incompetence is hurting your ability to get the project executed or task completed. But you need to keep the bigger picture in mind. The reason people get ahead, is that they are viewed as leaders. Your manager needs to be able to imagine you at the next level, managing and coaching people. One of the best ways to do that is to be seen mentoring and helping your peers in the organization. So rather than complaining and getting mad and holding incompetent people accountable like everyone else does, I try to find opportunities to help them, to mentor them, to make life easier for them. And I do it in a way that is visible so my manager and other executives can see what I'm doing. This is a great way to take a bad situation and use it to raise your profile in the company. Next time you're about to lose your marbles on someone for doing crappy work on your project, consider helping them instead.</p><p> I hope these tips are helpful to you.

{"original_id":4523,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"The Positive Side Of Negative Thinking","link":"the-positive-side-of-negative-thinking","source_link":null,"content":"<p> I grew up in a family that survived by preparing for the worst: blizzards, drought, broken fences, and the threat of wildfire.</p><h3> There was a positive side to this negative thinking&mdash;as ranchers who made a living by raising cattle, we kept them fed, watered, and safe from Wyoming&rsquo;s fierce winters and suffocatingly hot summers.</h3><p> <br/> I remember Dad always anticipating the worst possible outcome as the severe seasons rolled by so he could prepare, and land on his feet when confronted with the unknown.</p><p> <strong>  As an FBI agent, we planned arrests by giving priority to what could go wrong. We were not optimists who hoped everything would go according to plan. </strong></p><p> Both my Dad and my fellow FBI agents were intelligent thinkers who were mentally tough. That is, they weighed the possibility of a negative outcome with equal heft as the possibility of a positive outcome.</p><h3> Intelligent thinking is another term for positive thinking.</h3><p> <br/> Let me be clear&mdash;positivity is not optimism that always expects things to change for the better, nor is it pessimism that always assumes the worst will happen.</p><p> It is often as difficult for optimists to be positive thinkers as it is for pessimists. Positive thinking is not denying the contribution of negative thinking. In fact, it&rsquo;s wise to prepare for the worst that could happen in business and life.</p><p> The term &ldquo;positive thinking,&rdquo; however, has been polluted by the relentless cheer of motivational speakers who pressure their audience by goading them to stamp out all traces of negativity.</p><p> While this approach seems to be popular with some audiences, it&rsquo;s not a particularly sophisticated&mdash;or realistic&mdash;approach to life.</p><p> <strong>  Mental toughness is not being afraid of negativity; instead, it is learning how to harness its power so it works for you. </strong></p><p> Here are 5 ways negative thinking can make you a positive thinker:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Be A Positive Thinker By Accepting Your Negative Emotions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Observe all of your emotions and sensations as they come to the surface&mdash;not just the feel-good ones. Do not try to suppress a negative emotion simply because it&rsquo;s negative. Be honest about what you are feeling.</p><p> <strong>  TIP:  </strong> Acknowledge all of your emotions and try not to judge them as being positive or negative. Then let them pass. The key is to not dwell on those emotions which are counterproductive or undesirable.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Be A Positive Thinker By Embracing the Possibility of Failure </strong></h3><p> <br/> The all-positive approach of motivational speakers is relentless in its pursuit of perfection. The more realistic approach of positivity, on the other hand, does not reject failure. In fact, positive thinkers embrace failure as a challenge&mdash;a call to action to keep moving forward.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong>  Do not give up and walk away, searching for something easier at which you will finally succeed. If achieving this goal is important to you, continue to approach the problem, but from different angles while at the same time honing your talents and skills.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Be A Positive Thinker By Looking for Positive Options </strong></h3><p> <br/> Positive thinking is embracing the reality of a negative outcome in a situation, but continually looking for and finding the positive options that every situation offers.</p><p> Thoughts are stubborn; once you let them take hold and grow roots, it is very difficult to erase them from your mind. Whatever grabs your attention rules your life. So, you need to control your thinking.</p><p> <strong>  Researchers confirm that the very thing your mind focuses on is the same thing that you will start to notice in your daily life. </strong></p><p> Your survival instinct has warned you of the possible negative outcome; now, you need to counter that warning with a positive response that will prepare you as you move toward the obstacle.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong>  Recognize the negative aspects of your situation, but don&rsquo;t dwell on them. Turn your attention to the positive options available to you.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Be A Positive Thinker By Believing You Can Prevail </strong></h3><p> <br/> Positivity is believing we can prevail in our situation, regardless of the circumstances. Prisoners of war and Navy SEALS have found that their belief in their own ability to prevail in extreme and adverse conditions is what kept them alive.</p><p> Survival, in one form or another, is at the heart of mental toughness. It is prevailing over our circumstances and moving forward.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong> When things look tough, you will need to have the grit to be persistent and understand that failure is not the end&mdash;it simply represents another way to approach our situation.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Be A Positive Thinker By Differentiating Between Visioning and Fantasy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Visioning is based on solid science. By visioning our performance repeatedly, our brain stores that information as a success. And with each success, our brain releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This is the chemical that becomes active when we encounter situations that are linked to rewards from the past.</p><p> Use your dopamine not only to see rewards, but to move toward them.</p><p> Dreams can easily turn into fantasies if we let our thoughts get out of control, and fantasies can actually lessen our chance for success. Those who are adamant optimists about a positive future will experience a greater shock when things go wrong. If people fantasize only positive beliefs about their future, they are less prepared and more stressed when things don&rsquo;t workout they way they had hoped.</p><p> <strong>  TIP: </strong>  For you to be a leader, you must see things as they really are. Then see them the way you can make them better.</p><p> Mental toughness is not just surviving through tough times, it is thriving, and not letting the environment control your thinking. Don&rsquo;t pretend the negative aspects of your situation don&rsquo;t exist, but don&rsquo;t dwell on them. Instead, believe you will prevail by looking for, and finding, positive options.</p><p> What suggestions do you have for learning how to harness the power of negativity?</p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-11 21:44:54.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-11 21:44:54.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_5ggyREy.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/the-positive-side-of-negative-thinking/\", \"post_id\": \"9764\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-11 21:44:54\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-11 21:44:54\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"the-positive-side-of-negative-thinking\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9763\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4693\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-Positive-Side-Of-Negative-Thinking_0.jpg\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"803\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457773200,"author_id":290,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4524,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Exploring the RIA Phenomenon: The Buyer's Bias","link":"exploring-the-ria-phenomenon-the-buyers-bias","source_link":null,"content":"<p> There is an inescapable truth that exists in the RIA community. The fact is, an overwhelming majority of advisory firms want to buy another firm. Their desire to grow inorganically is the same, whether they have $2 billion, $200 million or $25 million of assets under management. Where does this desire come from? We like to refer to it as the &ldquo;Buyer&rsquo;s Bias,&rdquo; which is comprised of a series of factors that support the notion that along with being human, advisors are vulnerable to human biases.</p><h3> The Supporting Data</h3><p> <br/> Each year, we analyze the aggregated data of completed subscriber profiles within the RIA Match database to measure goals and trends within the marketplace. Last spring, out of 800 completed profiles, only 41% selected &ldquo;merge&rdquo; as a goal. Compare that figure to this year&rsquo;s analysis, which indicated 37% of 1,130 completed profiles intended to merge, and you&rsquo;ll find this level of interest noteworthy. Much can be inferred from this data point&mdash; we normally think of inorganic growth from acquisitions, a tuck in from wirehouse breakaways or an independent broker-dealer (IBD) hybrid migrating to the fee only space. Merger interest is a different flow.  This movement between RIAs is a sign of the high demand for experienced talent against the backdrop of the talent shortage and the desire for inorganic growth as the challenges of organic growth bear down upon advisory firms.</p><h3> The IKEA Effect</h3><p> <br/> Why are most independent financial advisors buyers?  There is actually a good explanation for this, backed by extensive research by behavioral economists. In Dan Ariely&rsquo;s book, The Upside of Irrationality, he discusses these findings.</p><p> Think about the times you&rsquo;ve toiled away at assembling a Do-It-Yourself project, such as a dresser for your daughter&rsquo;s first apartment. The instructions are never quite right and the collections of screws roll around the floor as you try to steady the pre-cut pieces and screw them together. You finally get it done and you stand there, proud of your work. The pride of creation and ownership runs deep in human beings. We are proud of our creations, whether it&rsquo;s a DIY project or the advisory firm we built from the very first client.</p><p> The effort that a business owner puts into creating their firm does not merely impact the bottom line. The sweat and tears poured into every aspect of the business changes the way the owner evaluates the firm. This bias is why advisors tend to overvalue what they build; why they lose their ability to be objective.</p><h3> Loss Aversion and the Endowment Effect</h3><p> <br/> Loss aversion means that our emotional reaction to a loss is about twice as intense as our joy at a comparable gain. Finding $100 feels pretty good, whereas losing $100 is absolutely miserable. Money that is gained and then lost has a higher psychological impact than money we never had in the first place.</p><p> Once you have built a firm, you don&rsquo;t want to risk losing it or selling it. The pain of the loss is twice as intense as the joy of the sale.</p><p> This is called the Endowment Effect; we get used to owning something and it becomes the baseline by which we judge future gains and losses. Once ownership is established, people become biased and tend to overvalue the item&mdash;in this case, their firm. We focus on what we could potentially give up, much more than what we could gain. When considering a transaction, regardless of what the most advantageous choice would be from an objective economic viewpoint, we have a hard time letting go.</p><h3> FOMO &ndash; Fear of Missing Out</h3><p> <br/> Fear of Missing Out is a function of regret&mdash; when we evaluate our happiness not just from where we are, but where we could be. If you are close to your goal but you miss it, you have great regret. You imagine the alternative reality and you feel the loss of missing out. Comparatively, if you miss your goal by a larger margin, the regret seems less because you couldn&rsquo;t have imagined closing the gap.</p><p> There was a study of Olympic winners and their happiness levels. The Bronze winners were more grateful to be on the podium and the Silver medalists regretted not getting the gold. Similarly, most advisors tend to hold out for the gold, for fear of getting less.</p><h3> How to Overcome the Biases</h3><p> <br/> These are biases that come with being human, and which play a role in how we approach M&amp;A in the advisory space. Knowing they are in most cases inevitable, there are systematic ways to overcome the biases, to make good decisions about the sale, purchase or merger of our firm. Daniel Kahneman, author of Thinking Fast and Slow, creates a framework for understanding how we make decisions.

If more young girls joined in, they could shake the ground and make an imprint in concrete. On February 9, of this year, we celebrated the 30th annual National Girls &amp; Women in Sports Day. The theme this year was \"Leading the Way,\" which was in appreciation of all those individuals and organizations on the front line for girls and women in sports.</p><p> I'm honored to have been a  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.girlsontherun.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Girls on the Run  </a> </u>  coach for two seasons and to be the mother of two confident daughters. Girls on the Run is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating a world in which every girl knows and uses her limitless potential and is free to realize her goals. Coaches reach these girls through interactive lessons and running games. The 24-lesson curriculum is taught by certified Girls on the Run coaches and includes three parts: understanding ourselves, valuing relationships and teamwork and understanding how we connect with and shape the world at large.</p><p> I believe that playing sports builds confidence. I see the fire igniting inside every girl when she dons her bright running gear, messy ponytail and flushed face. I want the girls on my team and my daughters to have that fire&mdash;and never let it be extinguished.</p><p> Girls on the Run is about more than running. It is a fundamental part of their journey toward higher self-esteem and greater confidence. My 10-year-old daughter, Karolina, has been on the team for three seasons. If she stumbles, she has the confidence to get up and keep striving toward the finish line.</p><p> It is also about teamwork. My older daughter, Sarina, is 19 years old and often runs with Karolina to encourage her. Women need to support each other and bond together to create a more powerful network.</p><p> <strong>  The financial world is no different: </strong> You need confidence and a good support system to achieve your goals. As a Certified Financial Planner professional, my passion lies in ensuring that women are financially confident&mdash;and I coach my clients just as I do my girls. I always challenge myself to inspire and empower those around me to believe in themselves and reach their full potential.</p><p> Here are four more ways playing sports and financial planning parallel each other:</p><h3> 1. Both help reduce stress.</h3><p> <br/> Stress causes the immune system to weaken and depression to seep in&mdash;and dealing with finances can add to your burden. Playing sports is a great way to burn off stress and feel good. Similarly, taking control and being proactive with your finances can reduce the stress you feel.</p><h3> 2. Both encourage smart decision-making.</h3><p> <br/> Women and girls need to understand science and math to succeed in sports. There are a lot of calculations that go into making a basket or figuring out what the opponent's next move will be.</p><p> Having financial literacy is equally as important to achieve financial wins. Financial education helps everyone&mdash;particularly women&mdash;gain clarity, confidence and control over their personal finances. You need to understand money matters in order to make big decisions such as whether to attend college, which student loan payment option is best for you or what kind of car to purchase.</p><h3> 3. Both allow you to give back to the community.</h3><p> <br/> Sports connect the participants with the community who watches the game. In fact, as a Girls on The Run coach, I urge the girls to identify and champion a community impact project and earn money for charity.</p><p> With smart financial planning, you can incorporate giving money to charity into your budget and put your money to work for a cause you believe in.</p><h3> 4. Both give you reasons to celebrate.</h3><p> <br/> The Girls on The Run season culminates with a 5K. It's so exciting to see them each cross the finish line&mdash;whether she comes in first place or last.</p><p> I celebrate the success of my clients the same way. Whether you pay off your student loan, contribute the maximum to your retirement plan, open a 529 college savings plan for your child or grandchild or make a charitable contribution, reaching your goal&mdash;no matter how long it may take&mdash;is a great accomplishment.</p>","channel":4,"channel_url":4,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-13 15:27:25.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-13 15:27:25.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_3zQQ7cB.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/financial-planning-and-sports-improve-your-life/\", \"post_id\": \"9768\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-13 15:27:25\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-13 15:27:25\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"financial-planning-and-sports-improve-your-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9767\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4695\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Financial-Planning-and-Sports-Improve-Your-Life.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"421\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457982000,"author_id":320,"chart_url":""}

Magic will not happen. A click of the SEND button to disburse updates would have done the trick.</p><h3> But here&rsquo;s the real price we pay.</h3><p> <br/> Every time we engage in another redundant business conversation, we kill the spirit of everyone who is present. We destroy creativity, initiative, optimism. We extinguish the fire that fuels exceptional work.</p><p> Now to you and me. We&rsquo;re sitting in such a meeting. We sense the absence of collective energy. We want to say something. Our butts are starting to itch in their seats, our chests are tightening into a defensive shield. We feel the slow death. We want to scream.</p><p> What do you do? What do I do? I attended a strategy planning session last month. Bill, the GM, kicked it off with a series of research and data slides. They droned on. And on and on. Until Michelle spoke up.</p><p> I know you have carefully planned this session, Bill! Michelle said softly but firmly. But you&rsquo;re losing me. I am feeling the energy die in this room. Can we open up the conversation?</p><p> Her words matched my sentiments. It took Michelle to say it. She said it clearly, directly, with respect. Michelle&rsquo;s words made me think of all the reasons we invent for NOT speaking up. Our internal mind police:</p><li> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t want to be the one who always rescues the team. </strong></li><li> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t feel safe speaking up. </strong></li><li> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t want to be attacked for my opinion. </strong></li><li> <strong>  I don&rsquo;t want to create tension in the group. </strong></li><li> <strong>  I am not the meeting leader. </strong></li><li> <strong>  It is futile to speak up. </strong></li><p> <br/> The moment Michelle finished speaking, others chimed in. Surprising ideas were shared. The energy in the meeting began to crackle. Michelle stopped the slow death.</p><p> As I contemplate spirit-killing meetings, I think of the legendary theatre director Peter Brook. Brook wrote &ldquo;The Empty Space,&rdquo; a now classic book on how we create performance and make meaning. Anytime a group of actors gathers in an empty space, Brook postulates, it has the opportunity to create magic. When done well, the actors make a sacred theatre. When not, they perpetuate the deadly kind.</p><p> A spirit-killing-meeting is the business variant of deadly theatre. You and I are the actors in this sort of performance. And second by second, we have choices about how we fill our empty space.</p><h3> Yes, it begins with you and me.</h3><p> <br/> Time to stop being a victim. Time to notice our mind police. And have the courage to speak up. Clearly, directly, with respect. Why not?</p><p> <strong>  Energy will crackle. </strong></p>","channel":3,"channel_url":3,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-13 15:51:57.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-13 15:51:57.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_pFqwVNA.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/how-to-stop-being-a-bad-meeting-victim/\", \"post_id\": \"9770\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-13 15:51:57\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-13 15:51:57\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"how-to-stop-being-a-bad-meeting-victim\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9769\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4696\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-Stop-Being-a-Bad-Meeting-Victim.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1012\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457960400,"author_id":1,"chart_url":""}
{"original_id":4527,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"Building Relationships - In Business and In Life","link":"building-relationships-in-business-and-in-life","source_link":null,"content":"<p> <strong>  So, the romance day of the year - Valentine's Day - is now behind us. It is surely a time when people think about their relationships.  </strong></p><p> Beyond their significant others, though, I wonder if many business leaders spare a thought for their work-related relationships?</p><p> I ask because of seeing so many companies, over so many years, take a simplistic, and at times patronising, approach to \"building relationships\" with both their customers and their employees. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying the principle of building relationships with these two communities is wrong - far from it.</p><p> The evidence is overwhelming as to the relative value of retaining a satisfied customer rather than just acquiring new ones. Many a manager will also tell you how much more productive and cost-effective it is to keep motivated employees rather than keep spending more on recruitment. So, there is nothing wrong with the goal. </p><h3> Businesses get it wrong</h3><p> <br/> Where, I feel, businesses fall down is the approach taken to achieving this goal. All too often, it feels like these are just \"relationships\" as a means to an end. Talking about \"loving\" your customers or colleagues while really just seeking the latest route to greater profit will fall through. People are not stupid, and disingenuous actions are almost always seen through over time. Besides, I fear the approach taken by many such communications comes across more like a \"player\" than as a person wanting to build a mutually-rewarding relationship. </p><p> Perhaps the root cause is not too much focus on relationships, but too little. After generations of industry experts talking about CRM, Customer Centricity, Customer Insight, CXM, and numerous other buzzwords, I can fully understand you still feeling skeptical. But please bear with me. What I mean is that for all the business and technical waffle, perhaps the relationships analogy (on which all the above are based) is too superficial an understanding of real world relationships. </p><h3> Valentine&rsquo;s Day</h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s return to the theme of Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p><p> Imagine the scene. You remembered the card, flowers, present, and dinner reservation (which would be a minor miracle for me). There you both are, gazing lovingly at each other over a candlelit table in your favourite restaurant. What do you do next? </p><p> Here are a few options inspired by real life and business, you can judge which is which: </p><li> Remind your \"love\" how much you spent on this evening (so they \"value you\")? </li><li> Eat meal quickly and suggest you go straight to \"intimacy\" ASAP? </li><li> Take time to talk and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company? </li><li> Offer to upgrade to the premium menu selection, if they will sign a contract to stay with you for another year?</li><li> Keep using their name and reciting past interactions, to prove that you remember them? </li><li> Offer them money for their time and \"services?\"</li><li> Give them a tacky gold star and tell them you&rsquo;ll be publishing their photo on Facebook as \"date of the month?\" <br/>  </li><p> Well I think you get the point (and if you&rsquo;re thinking of trying some of those, you better be prepared to duck when the slap comes!) </p><h3> Faking it won&rsquo;t always make it</h3><p> <br/> As I&rsquo;m sure you can see, my point is that what businesses routinely do to their customers and staff to \"build relationships\" is tacky and fake compared to real life. You will know, from your own experience, that such behaviour comes across as manipulative or downright creepy when translated to your real relationships. But, somehow, we forget these basics in the strange world of corporate marketing. Simplistic versions of personalisation, that try too hard, seem to make sense. Overtly buying loyalty or even bribing \"recommendations\" sounds acceptable, and there is always the pressure to close the sale after the briefest of customer foreplay. </p><p> Perhaps just as telling is how this same behaviour is seen in the ways leaders seek to motivate their employees: tacky recognition schemes, paying cash bonuses for doing a job well, or using performance management systems to tell some of your team that they are better than others.</p><p> Is there another area of your life where you would consider gold stars, bribery or giving someone an \"A\" to be an authentic way to build a relationship? Worse still, there is compelling research that such an approach devalues the work your people do. In his fascinating book,  <a href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/punished-rewards/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Punished by Rewards, Alfie Kohn </a>  shares how the nobility and meaning people seek in their work is undermined by training employees to just do it for the money or promotion. </p><h3> Hope from your relationships</h3><p> <br/> Enough doom and gloom. Not everyone gets this wrong, and I want to end on a positive note. </p><p> After over 30 years of mostly happy married life, even I have learnt a few things about building and maintaining a loving relationship: taking time to keep getting to know that person better; being considerate and kind to them; protecting time to really give them your attention; enjoying their company &amp; opening up about so many areas of your shared life; trying new things. All these and more play such an important role in long-term happy relationships of all genders and orientations. </p><p> Are there any signs that businesses are \"getting it?\" Well, I&rsquo;ve spotted a few encouraging developments over recent years. </p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s what looks like better practices to me:  </strong></p><li> A focus on identifying customer irritants and fixing them (without a big song &amp; dance)</li><li> If a customer gives a bad rating/feedback, follow-up with prompt contact to apologise, learn, and fix</li><li> Content marketing that is relevant to customers and just given away for free (without requiring sign-up)</li><li> Leaders encouraging technical excellence in their teams and listening to what those teams know needs fixing</li><li> Leaders taking time to meet customers</li><li> Employees encouraged to  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/others/now-its-personal-just-be-you-the-customers-will-love-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  be themselves so their responses to customers are authentic </a></li><li> Co-creation with customers, to share understanding of what products or service could be built</li><li> Insight generation (from data, analysis, and research) that is managed well, tested, and improved over time</li><li> Fair pricing that rewards loyalty, without going on about it all the time</li><li> Transparency of sharing feedback on websites, demonstrable accountability</li><li> When things go wrong, businesses and leaders who first apologise (not first make an excuse) <br/>  </li><h3> Over to you</h3><p> <br/> Those are only a few situations. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have examples from your experience. Please do share what you&rsquo;ve seen and what you appreciate. </p><p> For now, just let me take time to encourage a more genuine, longer-term approach to relationships with customers and employees; honesty about what you can offer and want in return; taking time to listen to the other person and learning from the insights you glean; valuing them with attentive service and conversations that interest them. </p><p> Perhaps if we all take that ethos away from Valentine&rsquo;s Day this year, we might even start to build real relationships for the rest of the year.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-13 15:58:16.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-13 15:58:16.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_IPKIOeZ.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/building-relationships-in-business-and-in-life/\", \"post_id\": \"9771\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-13 15:58:16\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-13 15:58:16\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"building-relationships-in-business-and-in-life\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9769\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4697\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/How-to-Stop-Being-a-Bad-Meeting-Victim.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"354\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457982000,"author_id":379,"chart_url":""}

<br/>  </li><h3> Which Conversion Rate Optimization Tactics Should You Use in 2016?</h3><p> <br/> As you have limited resources, you want to leverage the CRO tactics that are easy to implement yet produce valuable data. <strong>  These four are your best bets for 2016: </strong></p><li> A/B testing is the only tool highly ranked both for ease and value</li><li> While usability testing is rated with moderate difficulty, it received very high marks for value</li><li> Copy optimization is one of the easiest methods to implement and yields average value</li><li> Customer journey analysis can be difficult to implement, but it provides the most value <br/>  </li><h3> CRO Tactics to Consider Next</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The following tools could provide significant value. </strong> However, carefully consider if the implementation effort is worth it:</p><li> Segmentation requires significant effort but is ranked as providing the fourth highest value</li><li> Web personalization is rated as the most difficult to implement but provides significant value</li><li> Online surveys are simple to use but have inconsistent value <br/>  </li><h3> Conversion Rate Optimization Tactics to Skip</h3><p> <br/> Based on the 2015 conversion rate optimization study, you are better off not using the following tactics. <strong>  While they may provide some value, one of the previously listed tools would probably be a better choice: </strong></p><li> Competitor benchmarking is fairly simple to perform but has the least value (because your competitors are probably doing it wrong, anyway)</li><li> Behavioral email ranks below average both in ease and value</li><li> Multivariate testing is one of the most difficult to configure and has only moderate value</li><li> Abandonment emails require moderate effort and have limited value (and frankly, unless you have marketing automation software that knows who your visitors are, this optimization is impossible)</li><li> Cart abandonment analysis is very difficult to implement and has only moderate value (again, only applies to ecommerce companies) <br/>  </li><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve studied the conversion rate optimization efforts of last year, you are better prepared to optimize in 2016.</p><p> Every online marketing plan should include optimizing existing content. Because it&rsquo;s easier to optimize old content than to create new content, it&rsquo;s going to be easier on your schedule.</p><p> How much more value could you get from your web presence?

{"original_id":4529,"sponsored_position":0,"title":"What Every Financial Advisor Website Needs","link":"what-every-financial-advisor-website-needs","source_link":null,"content":"<p> More and more financial advisors are taking a look at their websites and realizing that it&rsquo;s just not working for them anymore. What used to be a decent brochure site that prospective clients could visit for more information about a financial firm is now becoming an artifact of a lost time period.</p><p> Today, it&rsquo;s no longer effective or even adequate to have an antiquated website with boilerplate copy and out-of-the-box design. In fact, operating with a website like this can actually hurt your brand and turn prospective clients away, because these same prospective clients expect much more from their online experience now. Having a site that is valuable and useable to your ideal client is of the highest priority. Otherwise, visitors to your website could quickly  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.crazyegg.com/2012/10/02/reasons-bounce-rate-is-high/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   bounce off your site  </a> </u>  with a bad impression, losing you potential new business and reinforcing a poor brand perception.</p><p> There is hope! Here are just a few things every financial advisor website needs to have in order to support a positive online experience and your overall business goals:</p><h3> <strong>  A Story (that stars your ideal client) </strong></h3><p> <br/> First and foremost, your website should read like a narrative, not a user&rsquo;s manual. All too often, advisor sites tout features and benefits and forget to share a convincing story that helps you build trust with your audience. Traditionally, advisor websites talk exclusively about the advisor and their services. What about your ideal client? Where are they in your story? Can they recognize themselves in your narrative or is it so vague and nonspecific no one knows? Take the time to craft a brand story that focuses in on the very audience it seeks to appeal to.</p><h3> <strong>  Your Value Proposition </strong></h3><p> <br/> In a nutshell, you need to immediately share why someone should choose you over anyone else. What makes you different and what supreme value do you offer that convinces someone to consider you for their financial needs? If you can&rsquo;t get this very important message across on your home page in less than 6 seconds, you need to keep working on it until you can.</p><h3> <strong>  Responsive Web Design </strong></h3><p> <br/> All this means is that your website needs to be able to be easily viewed and used across every device from desktop, mobile, tablet, ereaders &ndash; you name it.  83% of mobile users say that a seamless experience across all devices is very important ( <u>  Wolfgang Jaegel, 2015 </u> ) and 91% of mobile users say that access to content is also very important ( <u>  Wolfgang Jaegel, 2015 </u> ). What about the fact that 57% of users say they won&rsquo;t recommend a business with a poorly designed mobile site ( <u>  <a href=\"http://cmsreport.com/articles/the-5-mobile-marketing-mistakes-infographic-12442\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CMS Report, 2015  </a> </u> ) and an incredible 88% of consumers who search for a type of local business on a mobile device call or go to that business within 24 hours ( <u>  <a href=\"http://nectafy.com/mobile-marketing-trends-mash-up/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nectafy, 2014  </a> </u> )! As you can see, having a responsive website isn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;nice-to-have,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a must.</p><h3> <strong>  Compelling Copy </strong></h3><p> <br/> If your website has borrowed copy from the Financial Planning Association&rsquo;s website or another syndicated source, it&rsquo;s time to update. Your copy should be personalized to your brand and targeted to your audience. If you&rsquo;re using &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo; copy, it can be neither of those things and you&rsquo;re doing your brand a real disservice by not producing original copy. Your audience can get a real sense of the style of your firm and service by how you write and the tone you take. If your website is a prospective client&rsquo;s first impression of you and your brand, why would you ever want that impression to be anything less than honest and authentic?</p><h3> <strong>  Engaging Media </strong></h3><p> <br/> Visual appeal is extremely important and works to support and amplify the message and meaning of your brand. For this reason, make sure your website features images, graphics and video that engages your audiences, reinforces a message or a feeling and keeps their attention! Many service firms are even opting to use their own pictures instead of stock photography so that they can provide visitors with a more intimate view into their business.</p><h3> <strong>  Blog </strong></h3><p> <br/> According to Content Marketing Institute, <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   70% of people  </u> </a>  would rather learn about a company via an article than an ad. People can learn a lot about your business through the value you deliver through a relatively simple article. A blog is a great way for you to share useful information to your audience and position yourself as a thought leader. Blogs help to attract ideal clients to your site and also keep your site relevant and can increase your SEO and site rankings ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/seo/9-reasons-blogging-essential-good-seo-results-0866944#JjEeBRxwgJZfSb8c.97\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   B2B Community, 2014  </a> </u> ). A stagnant website is a website search engines view far less favorably and much less trustworthy.</p><h3> <strong>  Helpful Resources </strong></h3><p> <br/> Having helpful resources on your website not only helps your brand build trust and make yourself valuable, but it&rsquo;s just plain smart. If you provide a resource for an exchange of information (lead contact data), you have made a new connection that can become a profitable new relationship. I think  <u>  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/07/the-content-marketing-revolution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Business Review  </a> </u>  says it best when they observe:</p><h3> Conventional wisdom told brands to keep knowledge quiet, to put &ldquo;trade secrets&rdquo; under indefinite embargo and to let exclusive information gather dust in corporate archives. But with the advent of the Internet, social media, and the dispersal of knowledge in every direction, corporations are in the unique position to distribute the information they&rsquo;ve gathered in exchange for audiences, readership, and brand loyalty.</h3><p> <br/> If I&rsquo;ve said it once, I&rsquo;ll say it forever &ndash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/content-marketing/why-you-should-be-giving-away-all-your-advice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   give all your advice away  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Calls to Action &amp; Landing Pages </strong></h3><p> <br/> Calls to action (or CTAs) are those fun clickables on a website that help your website guest take an action you&rsquo;ve prescribed. If your website is all copy and doesn&rsquo;t allow your visitor to actually DO anything, than it&rsquo;s not doing you any favors. Your prospective clients leave without leaving behind their proverbial calling card, never to return again &ndash; because why would they? Calls to action on a website help you to drive specific action on your website that start your prospective client down the path of your firm&rsquo;s specific sales funnel.</p><h3> <strong>  Appointment Scheduler </strong></h3><p> <br/> Contact forms are great and definitely keep those, but why not make it even easier for a serious prospect to get on your calendar! If people visit your site 1x, 2x, 10x and eventually get to the point where they feel comfortable and want to talk with someone, eliminate their barrier to access. With an online scheduler like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scheduleonce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ScheduleOnce  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.calendly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Calendly  </a> </u>  or a host of others, you can allow prospects to schedule an introductory consultation with you on their terms without the inefficient back and forth of trying to figure out a time that works for both of you.</p><h3> <strong>  Social Media </strong></h3><p> <br/> Lastly, make sure your website provides access to your social media accounts and contains social sharing icons so that your website visitors can share your blog posts with their networks. In today&rsquo;s connected world, you have an opportunity to do so much more than use your website as an informational piece. You have online access to engage with and cultivate relationships with the clients you want most. Being active on social media and building your online community is a topic I&rsquo;ll cover in more detail in another post.</p><p> So take a hard look at your website. Visit it as if you were your ideal client. Does it convey the right message and experience? More importantly, would you want to learn more and possibly work with you? Your website is a living, breathing extension of you and your brand. If it&rsquo;s not quite up to your standards, hopefully you now have some clearer direction of some enhancements you can start making right away.</p>","channel":1,"channel_url":1,"secondary_channel":null,"secondary_channel_url":null,"publish_date":"2016-03-13 16:28:46.000000","last_updated":"2016-03-13 16:28:46.000000","image_url":"2016/3/article_placeholder_HkfHgfP.jpg","seo_meta":"","author_wpid":0,"video_url":"","video_title":"","audio_url":"","audio_file":"","transcript":null,"white_paper_pdf":"","subtitle":"","placefilter":0,"rss_include":1,"podcast_rss_include":0,"fresh_finance_category":null,"status":1,"other":"{\"flag\": \"\", \"category\": \"\", \"creator\": \"dheikkinen\", \"guid\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/uncategorized/what-every-financial-advisor-website-needs/\", \"post_id\": \"9775\", \"post_date\": \"2016-03-13 16:28:46\", \"post_date_gmt\": \"2016-03-13 16:28:46\", \"comment_status\": \"closed\", \"ping_status\": \"open\", \"post_name\": \"what-every-financial-advisor-website-needs\", \"post_parent\": \"0\", \"menu_order\": \"0\", \"post_password\": \" \", \"is_sticky\": \"0\", \"tps_options\": \"a:4:{s:7:\\\"enabled\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:21:\\\"nav_vertical_position\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";s:23:\\\"nav_hide_on_first_slide\\\";b:0;s:23:\\\"slide_loading_mechanism\\\";s:6:\\\"global\\\";}\", \"_thumbnail_id\": \"9774\", \"_fgd2wp_old_node_id\": \"4699\", \"wpcf-image\": \"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/What-Every-Financial-Advisor-Website-Needs_0.png\", \"_views_template\": \"0\", \"_edit_last\": \"7\", \"_schema_ref\": \"37983\", \"post_views_count\": \"1436\", \"_yst_prominent_words_version\": \"1\", \"mvp_post_template\": \"global\", \"mvp_featured_image\": \"show\", \"mvp_post_gallery\": \"hide\", \"_yoast_wpseo_content_score\": \"60\", \"_yoast_wpseo_focuskeywords\": \"[]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_keywordsynonyms\": \"[\\\"\\\"]\", \"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category\": \"\", \"custom_permalink\": \"grow/leadership/make-it-a-disruptive-new-year/\", \"_wp_old_date\": \"2019-05-03\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_url\": \"http://torchlite.com/2016/01/03/digital_marketing_demographics\", \"wpcf-field_canonical_url_title\": \"\", \"_yoast_wpseo_linkdex\": \"72\", \"_yoast_wpseo_is_cornerstone\": \"1\", \"_wp_old_slug\": \"how-do-you-build-a-great-organization\"}","other_meta":"[]","toolset_associations_contributor_post":null,"wpcf_publishdate":1457949600,"author_id":311,"chart_url":""}
