    "content": "<p> Do you look at what your organization or company needs and try to fill that need? Sounds like a wonderful practice, right?</p><h3> Or do you look at what you have to offer and try to use that talent in helping your company?</h3><p> <br/> Howard Thurman, an influential African American author, philosopher, and civil rights leader said, <strong>  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.&rdquo; </strong></p><p> Have you come alive in your gifts or talents? Do you use those in your occupation? Take a few minutes and think through these four questions. See if you can put your finger on what makes you come alive.</p><h3> <strong>  What do I do with ease while others may struggle? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Just because it is easy does not mean it is your purpose, of course. But a good way to discover what gives you joy is looking at the tasks or assignments that come easily to you. In the same way, if you struggle with a certain ability, you can be sure it&rsquo;s not something that makes you heart beat faster. Listing what you can do easily is a good place to start on the road to living fully.</p><h3> <strong>  What are the compliments I have received more than once? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your friends and family are a great resource you have for finding out what makes you come alive. Listen to them. They will probably tell you again and again if they notice that you are good at something. Ask those closest to you what they see you doing with exuberance and joy.</p><h3> <strong>  What can I imagine doing for 10,000 hours? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Malcolm Gladwell, in his book Outliers, quoted neurologist Daniel Levitin, &ldquo;The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert&mdash;in anything.&rdquo; So what could you imagine doing for that many hours &ndash; or what have you done that is on its way to 10,000 hours? If you&rsquo;ve been spending that much time at it, it probably helps your heart come alive.</p><h3> <strong>  What energizes me and what exhausts me? </strong></h3><p> <br/> List the activities or tasks you have done the past couple of weeks. Beside each, write &ldquo;energize&rdquo; or &ldquo;exhaust.&rdquo; As you look back and analyze your list, make note of any patterns. As you evaluate how you&rsquo;ve felt after each task, the things you do that make you come alive will emerge.</p><p> Once you have realized what makes you come alive, use that knowledge to make your life, and the lives of those around you, more valuable. If you concentrate on what makes you fulfilled, you will naturally meet the needs of those around you, simply because you will be drawn to those needs. Rumi said, &ldquo;Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love.&rdquo; <strong>  The world needs our heart when it is made alive. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> Losing your job can feel like falling into an abyss&mdash;and then having to drag yourself out on your belly through broken glass.</h3><p> <br/> And that&rsquo;s before you even start thinking about the financial implications of having your primary revenue stream cut off.</p><p> So while you&rsquo;re searching for your next gig, here are a few tips to keep your financial life humming.  </p><h3> <strong>  1. Know your numbers.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Make sure you know your fixed costs (rent, mortgage, debt or other expenses that will keep on coming regardless of your employment status). You can control your discretionary spending&mdash;like entertainment and vacations&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll also have those that are semi-controllable (food, clothing, utilities). It is vital to track your spending and control what can be controlled right at the outset.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Check your liquidity.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is where a robust emergency fund is the perfect safety net. How long can you continue to pay your bills before your situation becomes dire? Some people scoff at keeping a chunk of money in savings, feeling that they are better served with the money invested in the markets. But combine a down market with a lost job and those investments aren&rsquo;t looking so attractive all of a sudden. If your liquidity is low, you might seek part-time work to fill in the gaps while you reposition your career.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Take advantage of COBRA and other benefits.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> You are entitled to continue health insurance after separation under most situations. While you&rsquo;re going to pay for the coverage, you can rest easy that you have coverage for 18 months and&mdash;in some cases&mdash;even longer. Don&rsquo;t overlook unemployment assistance as well&mdash;it can help tide you over until you land your next job. You might also have life or disability coverage that you can take with you and pay personally. This can be critical if you have a medical condition that might impact your ability to obtain coverage on your own. Pay close attention to the costs of continuing your current coverage to plans available in the marketplace.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Retirement plans.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve been saving in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan, you are entitled to transfer the funds to an Individual Retirement Account without any tax consequences. If you have a loan against your 401(k), you either have to satisfy the loan before transfer, or be prepared to include the loan as income; penalty included. If your company has a profit sharing plan, you are entitled to your vested Any unvested amounts go back into the plan. If you were covered under an increasingly rare Defined Benefit Pension, then make sure you check with your HR department about whether you are vested and to what degree.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Your personal RF&mdash;Resilience Factor.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you find yourself in the throes of depression or other debilitating mindset, seek professional help. Being dealt a blow to your income, not to mention your self-esteem, can be crushing for some; for others, it becomes a positive mission of self-awareness, self-improvement and determination to rebound from a loss. A qualified therapist can help you arm yourself with the tools you need to shift into a positive direction. Resilience is an important trait to build on so it will support through the challenges that future life transitions present.</p><p> Being prepared&mdash;both financially and emotionally&mdash;for a possible job loss (like any life transition) is critical to your long-term goals and desires for security and happiness.</p><p> But it doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident. <strong>  Why wait for an actual loss to start planning? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Although divorce is often synonymous with sadness, grief, and loss, it can also provide an opportunity for growth, renewal, change, and empowerment. Maybe not in the beginning, but as time goes on, glimmers of hope emerge that provide the signs that the tide will soon turn and life will create an upswing of positivity after living through months of turmoil and uncertainty.</p><p> And because all too often in life, when a major life event occurs such as divorce, we are quick to see the challenges instead of opportunities for growth and insight. We see obstacles rather than openings to a better life. Divorce is one of those things that, while in significant pain, our outlook, our lens, is clouded with uncertainty and despair. We feel limited to what we can do, the change we can make, and the gifts that are hiding in plain sight during this time of turmoil. But, there they are &ndash; and eventually, when the dust has cleared and the turmoil has softened around us, we are able to see the trees through the forest.</p><h3> <strong>  Opportunities for Change Post Divorce </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  Financial decision-making.  </strong></h3><p> All too often, many women were not in a position that afforded the opportunity to share in financial decisions or short or long term planning. Maybe you felt shut out or limited in what you could or could not do. Here is your opportunity to do something different.</p><h3> <strong>  Improved emotional well-being.  </strong></h3><p> You are the captain of your ship when it comes to your emotional well-being. It may not be happy and pleasant all the time, but here is an opportunity to really get to know yourself. You will come to understand and accept how strong you really are. Maybe you didn&rsquo;t feel that way before. Maybe you were unsure. Over time, you will be able to manage your emotions better and make decisions that are more logical and rational, less emotional. This will change the direction of your life.</p><h3> <strong>  Self-reflection.  </strong></h3><p> Doing the inner work that is necessary, will help you grow and heal. You will start to understand yourself in very different ways. You will have the time and space to examine any relationship patterns that might be holding you back from getting the relationship that you want and deserve.</p><h3> <strong>  Self-esteem. </strong>  </h3><p> Although at the onset of divorce you experienced fear because your world was turned upside down and was cloaked in uncertainty. But, eventually you will find energy you didn&rsquo;t know you had because much of your energy was directed towards trying to save your marriage or figure out how you would leave your marriage. That&rsquo;s a lot of energy. By taking this back, you will feel empowered and have a more take charge attitude. This will get you somewhere.</p><h3> <strong>  Independence. </strong>  </h3><p> You will be answering to yourself and creating a new life, with new experiences, new traditions. All your own. You will discover how capable you are in areas of your life that you felt you would never be able to manage on your own. All the small victories add up to feeling better about yourself. I remember the first time I figured out how to buy and use my very own first lawn mower. It was empowering!</p><h3> <strong>  Children and parenting.  </strong></h3><p> No longer in an unhealthy relationship with your spouse, you can make decisions that are best for you and your children. You have a greater emotional and mental &lsquo;band width&rsquo; to put that energy towards your children.</p><h3> <strong>  Friendships.  </strong></h3><p> You are able to cultivate the friendships and relationships that are beneficial and healthy. Divorce has a way of letting us know who your friends are and who are not. The ones who have your back and stand the test of time will rise to the top. They are your true friends, your support system, the people you need and want. And if you were friends with someone because of your marriage but didn&rsquo;t want to be, here is your opportunity to decide how you want to manage those relationships.</p><p> Changing your mindset to seeing divorce as a life-changing event that offers opportunities and personal growth, could be the start that you need to get you on a different &ndash; and healthier &ndash; path for your future.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If this were a perfect world, when prospecting and qualifying we would always get to speak with the decision maker and, while questioning them, we would discover that they were looking for our solution, and that they have the budget and authority to make a decision. Furthermore, when asked about their timeline for making a decision, they would reply, <strong>  &ldquo;Can you get it here yesterday?&rdquo; </strong></p><h3> Too bad we don&rsquo;t live in a perfect world&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> Instead, it&rsquo;s more likely these days that we don&rsquo;t get right through to the decision maker &ndash; or to that mysterious &ldquo;committee&rdquo; that is going to decide at some undisclosed point in the future &ndash; instead, there are usually some layers to go through first, before our product or service can finally get to the right set of eyes.</p><p> Usually the person standing in the way of the final decision maker is an influencer &ndash; someone who might weigh in on the decision but who doesn&rsquo;t have the final authority to make the ultimate decision.</p><p> <strong>  Now here&rsquo;s the key:  </strong> just because an influencer doesn&rsquo;t have the authority to make the final decision, that&rsquo;s not to say they don&rsquo;t know other crucial information that might help you navigate the decision tree and ultimately make a sale.</p><p> Unfortunately, many sales reps are terrible at vetting or qualifying the influencer, so they just send their information and then hope for the best.</p><p> If you follow the advice below, you will not only know how to get this crucial information, but you&rsquo;ll also separate yourself from 90% of the other sales reps who just don&rsquo;t know how to qualify influencers properly.</p><p> <strong>  Questions to ask: </strong>  Even though your influencer might not be the final decision maker, they often have some insight into what the decision is looking for, or what their interest in your product or service is.</p><p> Because this is true more times than it isn&rsquo;t, you must always ask any of the following questions to get this insight. If the person you&rsquo;re talking to is hiding behind the real decision maker, then ask things like:</p><p> &ldquo;_________, you probably work quite closely with (the decision maker), tell me, how open are they to adding (your product or solution)?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;_________, in terms of what you know, what is their (the decision maker or committee&rsquo;s) timeline for putting something like this into effect?&rdquo; <br/> OR</p><p> &ldquo;What other solutions are they considering right now?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;How do you get involved in the decision on something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;How much influence (or input) do you have on the final decision?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;How closely do you work with (the decision maker or committee)?&rdquo;</p><p> [If they are involved]:</p><p> &ldquo;What are you recommending they do?&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;From what we&rsquo;ve just gone over, do you think this is something that would work for them?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Give me your thoughts on how (the decision maker) is going to decide who to pick for this&rdquo;</p><p> OR</p><p> &ldquo;From what you know, what is (the decision maker) looking for in a solution like this?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Given what you know about the urgency for making this decision, how soon do you think they will decide on a solution?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;In terms of budget, what are they thinking?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;From your perspective, what is involved in their decision process?&rdquo;</p><p> OR <br/> &ldquo;How many other vendors are they going to look at before they make a decision?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;From the other companies they&rsquo;ve looked at, who are they leaning towards now?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Is the company they&rsquo;re using now still in the running?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;How likely do you think they&rsquo;ll just use the same company they&rsquo;re using now?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;What do you think it will take for them to choose a different solution from who they&rsquo;re using now?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Is there any reason you can see that they wouldn&rsquo;t move forward with something like this?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;Is there anything you can think of that I should know that&rsquo;s important for them in making this decision?&rdquo;</p><p> AND</p><p> &ldquo;What do you think I need to do to have the best shot of earning their business?&rdquo;</p><h3> As you can see, there are many areas and many questions you can ask which will give you tremendous insight into the sales process &ndash; if you just ask.</h3><p> <br/> Is the influencer going to know any or all of this? Of course not! But, again, more times than not, they&rsquo;ll know a lot more than you might think.</p><p> And if you begin asking some of these questions, you will know it, too!</p>",

    "content": "<p> While financial advisers have been figuring out how to get compliant over the last few years, consumers went and pulled a dirty trick while we weren&rsquo;t watching closely: they changed how they buy stuff, including buying professional services.</p><h3> The change has already happened of course.</h3><p> <br/> The old world of &ldquo;Push&rdquo; selling to get prospects to engage is dying rapidly &ndash; if indeed it still works at all really.  Instead we now have to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; them towards us with tempting content, stellar personal branding and perfect positioning.</p><p> So prospecting has actually become a marketing exercise now, rather than the personal selling exercise it was formerly.  Our sales and marketing funnel has changed accordingly:</p><p> Our selling role really only comes into play when the prospect is already close to deciding upon whether to engage or when we are making recommendations.</p><h3> Everything else is a function of marketing now.</h3><p> <br/> Which means that today&rsquo;s professional has to develop, or have, a wide array of, marketing skills as they are now probably far more important than personal sales skills.  Marketing does not just focus on creating opportunities and initial enquiries any longer; it handles every step of the nurturing and engagement right up until the point where the prospect is signing engagement terms and stepping over the line to becoming a client.</p><p> Marketing is now the &ldquo;make or break&rdquo; skill set for professionals wanting to grow their business, and generate more prospects who can turn into clients.  Building these new skill sets and the infrastructure to execute great ongoing marketing is where we need to focus resources and energy in our practice development because the consumers have already changed.

    "content": "<h3> The number one objection I get from Salespeople about Social Selling is &ldquo;Tim, with all the other pressures I have, I just don&rsquo;t have time for this.&rdquo;</h3><p> While I can give many arguments about changing your priorities, new ways of working, etc etc. Here are some ways you can shortcut the time you spend on Social Media. Of course, don&rsquo;t expect the same results, but it might get you into a Social Selling habit.</p><p> A member of my family, who is not a big reader, once asked me, what books should I read to get me into the reading habit. My advice was to start with magazines, start in small chunks then to move onto a Harry Potter or Dan Brown book. George Orwell, (as one person suggested) might not be the best place for her to start.</p><p> <strong>  This blog is about how a new starter can start the Social Selling journey. </strong> If you are a Social Selling purist or a long time Social Seller stop reading nowthis isn&rsquo;t for you. In addition, this won&rsquo;t get you thousands of followers but let&rsquo;s get in to the habit first.</p><p> First things first. There are many Social Networks but unless you have a particular reason to get into YouTube, Pinterest etc then as a B2B salesperson I would focus on LinkedIn and Twitter.</p><h3> How often should I post? At least once a day.</h3>You can post the same content on LinkedIn as well as Twitter. Here are the ten things you can do to Hustle your Social Selling<p> <strong>  1. When you get into work in the morning and you get your laptop / Mac out, post something to Twitter and LinkedIn. </strong> There must be something you read in the paper on the train on the way in or came in on email overnight.</p><p> <strong>  2. Use automation. </strong> If you have read my post  <a href=\"https://timothyhughesuk.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/why-dont-we-just-automate-social-media-we-can-then-go-back-to-doing-our-day-jobs-custexp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just automate Social Media, we can then go back to doing our day jobs&rdquo;  </u>    </a> you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m not a big fan of automation but  <u>  <a href=\"https://bufferapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u>  can be used to help you &ldquo;batch&rdquo; up a bunch of tweets in advance. When you get in the office in the morning, why not batch some Tweets or LinkedIn posts?</p><p> <strong>  3. Work as a Team. </strong> In all of the presentations I&rsquo;ve seen on Social Selling, Social Media is positioned as a solo effort. Rather than searching for content, why not retweet others? Form a team with work colleagues and agree to retweet each other or like posts on LinkedIn. Don&rsquo;t expect an explosion of followers, but you will start building a presence and (hopefully) start getting into the habit. The purists hate this one.</p><p> <strong>  4. Your Marketing department should be providing you with content. </strong> Agree, in many cases this can look very &ldquo;corporate&rdquo;, but using tools discussed in 2. You can batch this up and schedule a number posts. Check out the  <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jon-miller/the-411-rule-of-marketing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  4.1.1 Rule </a> .</p><p> <strong>  5. Reuse content. </strong> Why not use meeting notes to create Points of View (POV) LinkedIn / Blog posts. If you have had a meeting with the Finance Director of a Media company then blog, &ldquo;These are the top 5 issues we see in Accounting systems in Media today&rdquo; for example. Obviously, you don&rsquo;t mention the people, the places and the companies.</p><p> <strong>  6. Take corporate videos, events, areas that interest you and write a LinkedIn post. </strong> 5 lines of introduction and context and then post the video / link to the event. Not the most elegant way of working but it gets you started.</p><p> <strong>  7. What is your passion? </strong> Ask anybody about their passion and their eyes light up and immediately they become positively animated. Why start blogging about serious subjects, why not start with your passion? Sailing, Photography, etc</p><p> <strong>  8. Download a content curation tool like   <u>   <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Flipboard   </a>  </u>   or   <a href=\"https://klout.com/home?next=/measure\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    Klout   </u>      </a>  and find content </strong> , there must be time waiting in reception at a customer or on the train where you could find something relevant to Tweet? (Follow my magazine on Flipboard for example.)</p><p> <strong>  9. Create a list on Twitter of Influencers or subscribe to one of my lists and as mentioned in 3. </strong> retweet that content.</p><p> <strong>  10. Stop being a corporate suit and be human. </strong> OK, so it&rsquo;s a terrible clique but why not post a photo of your lunch / dog walk / airport lounge you are sitting in? In her book  <a href=\"http://www.dionnelew.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   &ldquo;Social Executive Dionne Lew  </u>    </a> says &hellip;.. &ldquo;Why not take a photo and post it, show your human side.&rdquo;</p><h3> Finally I often get asked how much time should I spend on Social Media?</h3>In my view, the world has changed and this requires us to change with it. On that basis, 30 mins a day would be a good target. Yes this is a lot of time, but what worked 20 years ago might not work now. Many Sales people I talk to work out what old ways they need to drop and find time for the working practices of the 21st century.",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"http://trumpia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sophorn Chhay  </u> </a> <strong>  Mobile technology has reached unprecedented levels on innovation. </strong> Products like Google Cardboard are revolutionizing virtual reality, and yearly location-based innovations are creating astounding utility. In 2016, mobile marketing will be a must-have by many businesses. Media-centric advertisements, immersive SMS and dynamic social media environments are to be expected.Companies are urged to adopt mobile strategies, and for many reasons. Everyday mobile users have come to expect higher forms of engagement, and they&rsquo;re pushing the smartphone&rsquo;s technological progress in an interesting direction. Business providers are switching to mobile-centric platforms for the following causes:</p><h3> <strong>  One: Smartphone Users are Relying on SMS </strong></h3><a href=\"http://www.ninjalinkbuilding.com/mobile/15-amazing-sms-marketing-facts-and-stats/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> About 79 percent of mobile users</a> currently rely on SMS opt-in services to make purchasing decisions. Modern shoppers are fully engaged with their devices, and they&rsquo;re preferring brand providers capable of offering text-heavy engagement platforms. Automated SMS platforms, too, are on the rise, boosting the total number of consumers considering text-for-service options superior than other provided offers.<h3> <strong>  Two: Mobile Loyalty Programs Work </strong></h3>An astounding 90 percent of smartphone users enrolled in mobile loyalty clubs have found them beneficial. Buyers love feeling like &ldquo;part of the program.&rdquo; Moreover, they&rsquo;re expectant of fully immersive outreach campaigns. Modern consumers are actively agreeing upon loyalty program participation, and companies able to host such programs are experiencing immense growth.Find out how <a href=\"https://blog.trumpia.com/blog/group-text-messaging\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  group texting </u>  </a>is assisting the shift to mobile-based loyalty programs. Every day, more consumers enter long-term brand programs with friends and family.<h3> <strong>  Three: Mobile Search is Becoming Preferred </strong></h3>Recent studies have revealed the sheer power behind mobile search. About <u> <a href=\"http://www.bloggerwits.net/2015/12/mobile-marketing-tips.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  90 percent of mobile searches </a></u> lead to consumer action, and modern businesses harnessing in-depth search systems are finding a massive surge in in-store traffic. If your company has a responsive design, it can capitalize on the consumer&rsquo;s inherent need of information. Store hours, location, product information and reviews have become the modern buyer&rsquo;s go-to search queries.<h3> <strong>  Four: Information Can Be Gathered In-Store </strong></h3><u> <a href=\"http://www.allblogthings.com/2015/12/ways-to-boost-your-mobile-marketing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Many sources have stated </a></u> the importance of in-store mobile data gathering. Because a majority of modern outlets support Wi-Fi, consumers are hooking into brand-specific check-in campaigns, store searches and loyalty programs. In-store Wi-Fi contains a massive benefit: It can procure in-depth consumer information.If a consumer is hooked directly into your network, you&rsquo;re able to analyze buying behavior, product preference and in-store activities. Brick-and-mortar outlets still hold weight in the mobile realm, and mobile marketers are working hard&mdash;and succeeding&mdash;at making a fully immersive experience.<h3> <strong>  Five: The Omnichannel Approach is Dominating </strong></h3>Today&rsquo;s buyers view products online before ever entering a physical location. One-channel marketing isn&rsquo;t effective anymore. Instead, prioritizing the &ldquo;digital window shopper&rdquo; proves to be effective. Mobile users typically carry their phones to the store, too. They&rsquo;re taking their primary search devices with them, opening a slew of multi-channel possibilities. Now, marketers have big opportunities to propose great offers, time-sensitive benefits and <u> <a href=\"http://www.dailyinspiration.nl/7-mobile-marketing-tips-for-a-successful-holiday/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  overall convenience </a></u>. In upcoming years, mobile will be considered a pre-requisite to the consumer&rsquo;s buying cycle.<h3> <strong>  Six: The Numbers Don&rsquo;t Lie </strong></h3>In 2016, <u> <a href=\"https://radio.co/blog/5-ways-sms-text-messaging-can-increase-your-radio-audience/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  over 2 billion consumers </a></u> are expected to purchase smartphones worldwide. The sheer popularity of mobile access will drive business as we know it, and companies are urged to hop aboard. If they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;ll fall behind the curve. Sure, challenges exist for the mobile marketer, but the road ahead is far clearer than it was a year ago.Mobile marketing strategies are becoming streamlined, too. New features, new technology and new brand approaches are paving the way for upcoming innovators. Companies like Apple and Google are redefining the mobile marketing world by creating new tools used by everyday consumers, too. Now, text requests, mobile voting systems, augmented reality, social media chat and in-store pick-up options are mainstream mobile features. Hop into the mobile marketing revolution&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s no secret to those of us following trends in inclusion and inequality that women continue to make significantly less money than men while doing, basically, the same jobs. <strong>  It may come as a surprise, then, that according to a recent survey, most employees don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a gender gap in their own workplaces. </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-gender-pay-gap-0210-biz-20160210-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  A  <u>   ccording to a survey by Glassdoor, reported in the Chicago Tribune  </u> </a> , 70 percent of U.S. employees don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a pay gap at their places of employment. Perhaps unsurprisingly &mdash; and somewhat ironically &mdash; whether or not you see a pay gap at work depends to some extent on your gender: <strong>  60 percent of women believe men and women are paid equally where they work, compared to 78 percent of men. </strong></p><p> The article pointed out that there is often little transparency behind salaries, which can help perpetuate the gender pay gap. In fact, many company&rsquo;s contractual provisions prevent employees from disclosing their salaries to co-workers. However, the Chicago Tribune cites social media company Buffer as an example of an organization bucking the trend: &ldquo;Some companies already disclose employee salaries to foster trust &mdash; see the radical transparency at (Buffer), which has gone public with its salary formula and the thinking behind it plus the salaries of individual employees online for the world to see.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Given the discomfort among many with discussing their pay or having others know what they make, Buffer&rsquo;s approach may seem extreme </strong> ; however, it very well may signal a growing trend. Currently, roughly a dozen states have laws prohibiting retaliation against employees who disclose their pay to co-workers. And in early 2016, on the seventh anniversary of the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/brochure-equal_pay_and_ledbetter_act.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">   Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act  </a> </u> , which protects against wage discrimination, President Obama  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3056117/the-future-of-work/obama-aims-to-close-the-wage-gap-with-a-new-proposal-for-salary-transpare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   announced a proposal  </a> </u>  that would require companies employing at least 100 employees to disclose the pay of their employees, broken down by race, gender and ethnicity.</p><p> Perhaps the growing number of employees dismissive of the gender pay gap at their companies is a sign of growing wage equality &mdash; or perhaps not. Either way, growing trends toward wage transparency should shed greater light on the issue.</p><h3> Are you ready to be transparent about the pay practices in your organization?</h3><p> <br/> If not, you may want to spend some time considering why not. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> The world is obsessed with Millennials. Thank you Snapchat.</h3><p> <br/> The largest, most diverse generation cohort in the U.S., born between 1980 and the mid-2000&rsquo;s with a social spoon in their mouth, dominate the app economy and the media attention graph. There&rsquo;s talk they may even be able to save the U.S. economy &mdash; if we&rsquo;re #lucky.</p><h3> But what about us, the proud &ldquo;I want my MTV!&rdquo; Gen Xers? Is all our hard-earned money for nothing :(</h3><p> <br/> Retirement is slowly creeping us, rearing its ugly head, like a video in the night. Results from an  <u>  Ameriprise Financial Retirement study on Generation X </u>  point to a new and evolving vision of retirement where traditional ways of thinking may no longer work. The time is now to get serious about planning our financial futures, since those of us born between 1965 and 1980 are turning 50 and working well into our mid to late 60s, even snapchatting with our Millennials cousins at some distant point in the future.</p><p> So listen up all of my fellow Gen Xer Madonna fans, don&rsquo;t just stand there, let&rsquo;s get to it! Here are ten retirement tips for ladies with an attitude:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Stop telling yourself you can&rsquo;t do this, because you can. </strong></h3><p> I am going to challenge you to know exactly what it going on with your money and your life. Not all at once. Begin to examine all of the places where you take money in and let money out. That includes your checking account, savings account, credit cards, mortgage, auto loans, school loans, 401(k), Roth, HSA, etc. You&rsquo;re smart enough to get this information albeit you&rsquo;ll have to go to multiple places to find it. Just make a pile so it is corralled all in one place. Why? Because where you are today determines the specific set of actions needed to get to tomorrow.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Invest in yourself, especially your health and your relationships. </strong></h3><p> Don&rsquo;t underestimate the multiplier effect of a healthy lifestyle, daily exercise, and a positive outlook on your career mobility, earnings potential, future business opportunities, and overall bottom line. Nutrition, sleep, and exercise are not just connected to your Fitbit but finances as well. The quality of your relationships is also major predictor of health, as was discovered by Dr. Robert J. Waldinger, a Harvard psychiatrist who performed the longest and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896234/\" target=\"_blank\">   most complete studies of adult life  </a> </u>  ever conducted. The study&rsquo;s major finding: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier (and I say wealthier) in later years.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Paint the picture, before you do the math.  </strong></h3><p> While doing the math is super important for retirement planning, the vision of what that looks like is even more significant. You need to imagine all aspects of your future self and clearly define the life goals most important to match the plan. The concept of life planning is nothing new however few of us, myself included, devote an entire day to the process, making it intentional by design and as comprehensive as it should be. How would you like to change that? I am working on my own life plan right now can recommend a great program designed by Michael Hyatt and Daniel Harkavy called  <u>  <a href=\"http://livingforwardbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Living Forward.  </a> </u>  Why don&rsquo;t you join me?</p><h3> <strong>  4. Make sure you have hard, cold cash, before you invest.  </strong></h3><p> Start saving for that rainy day because I guarantee, you&rsquo;re gonna need it. Sock away a minimum of six months, ideally twelve, of living expenses in a regular checking or savings account at an FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) member bank (hint: look for the FDIC logo). Do not invest this money. It needs to be completely liquid, by that I mean you can withdraw it immediately from a local bank branch and use it pay your bills online. Keep in mind this money is also FDIC insured. This means that if your bank fails, the first $250,000 in your account is insured by the FDIC and will be returned to you in the event of a bank failure.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Find a way to accelerate retirement savings, big time.  </strong></h3><p> Having the big 5-0 Partay this year? You can supercharge your retirement savings by depositing up to $24,000 into your 401(k), since the federal government provides a catch-up contribution of $6,000 to the usual $18,000 contribution limit. Furthermore, most of us have either a 401(k) or a 403(b) retirement savings plan at work and some workplaces may even offer a company match between 1 to 3%. Take advantage of this free money, if it is available and you are eligible for the program. Retirement savings this year may also be accelerated with an additional $6,500 (ages 50 or older) with a Traditional IRA and/or Roth IRA &ndash; restrictions apply, make sure to consult with a financial professional before you invest.  <u>  Related: Roth to the Rescue, Four Uber Awesome Benefits </u>  The more you put away, the better.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Go mobile with your investments, monitor your money.  </strong></h3><p> Don&rsquo;t just check into Facebook but with your money on a regular basis. In today&rsquo;s smartphone economy, you should have mobile accessibility to all checking, savings, and investment account information, not to mention trade confirmations and other important notifications such as tax documents by email. Only use the apps provided by your bank and/or financial institution such as TD Ameritrade and Fidelity and put a password on your phone for security reasons.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Attack your credit card debt, aggressively. </strong></h3><p> According to CreditCards.com the average APR (annual percentage rate) on retail credit cards has risen to 23.23%! These high and outrageous interest rates will reduce the amount of retirement funds that could have been invested and compounding over time and deplete your cash quickly if you&rsquo;re not careful. Also, be sure to get a copy of your credit report each year to ensure that all the information is correct and up to date. Federal law allows you to get a free copy of your credit report every 12 months from each credit reporting company &ndash; Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.annualcreditreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   annualcreditreport.com  </a> </u>  An effective strategy is to put your credit cards on ice (in the freezer) as you work towards paying off the debt as quick as you possibly can.  <u>  Watch Our YouTube Video: Freeze Your Credit Cards </u>  </p><h3> <strong>  8. Make prudent investing choices, align your decisions.  </strong></h3><p> Every decision you make in your life has an overall effect on your wealth, either positive or negative. Make investment choices that are smart, not made on the basis of emotion but on concrete data and facts. Look at your entire life picture and pay special attention to how much risk you may inadvertently have in your total investment portfolio. Do the numbers and closely examine the financial ramifications of each major life decision &ndash; a divorce, mortgage, education, new business, vacation, car, change of career - before you make it. Align spending, investment, and life decisions with your personal goals and things most important to you.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Begin to educate the NextGen, the Millennials in your life. </strong></h3><p> Gen Xers can remember a time when talking about money was taboo. We simply didn&rsquo;t have these types of conversations at the dinner table. That&rsquo;s no longer the case. We all have an obligation to pass along our financial know-how with the next generation, particularly if they are listed as beneficiaries on an investment account. Begin the education process early and be sure to acclimate your beneficiaries to the concept of investing and what it means. Invite them to Skype or FaceTime with your financial advisor and help them get started with their own investment account, no matter how small. SheCapital is happy to help :)</p><h3> <strong>  10. Work with a financial advisor you know, like, and trust.  </strong></h3><p> You deserve to work with someone who understands you, cares about who you are, and treats your relationship with care and respect. Finding that right person to work with is not always easy and takes time. Start by asking your friends, family, and people you work with on a regular basis. Once you have the name of a potential advisor, research their company and background on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   sec.gov  </a> </u>  Conduct multiple interviews, over the phone and in-person. Do not sign anything until you are absolutely sure you want to work with them. Make certain to ask the following questions as you evaluate the relationship and any potential conflicts of interest: 1. How does she get paid; 2. Does he receive commissions; and 3. Is she a fiduciary or a broker? A fiduciary, registered investment advisor or RIA, like SheCapital, is required by law to put the client&rsquo;s needs before their own. Unlike many, we do not accept commissions nor sell commissioned investment products.</p><h3> Ladies with an attitude are way too smart and work way too hard to simply let retirement creep by.</h3>",

    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;How do financial advisors know what questions to ask if they don&rsquo;t know how to communicate with me?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> I wonder how many every-day working people believe that only the rich make long term plans for their financial future. Could it be that the financial industry tends to position itself as available only to advise on family wealth, estate planning, finding ways to make the rich richer or manage their large inheritances and forgets the millions of others who need plans, want to be financially secure yet feel uncomfortable about discussing their hopes, dreams and limited finances with an advisor?</p><p> Byron R. Moore writes the following in his article,  <u>  Financial Fundamentals: Is financial planning about &lsquo;predicting&rsquo; or &lsquo;positioning&rsquo;? </u> :</p><p> <strong>  Question: </strong> How am I supposed to do any financial planning these days? I don&rsquo;t know who is going to be president, how the financial crisis in China is going to turn out or how we are going to deal with our national debt. It is difficult to know what to do next.</p><p> <strong>  Answer: </strong> Really? Is it really that difficult? Or are you just stuck because your concept of financial planning is proving to be fatally flawed?</p><p> When reading this article it occurred to me that maybe a more valid question from potential clients might be &lsquo;will my money be safe if I take your advice&rsquo;. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily refer to their ability to understand and manage risk; maybe it&rsquo;s more about allowing the client to share their genuine concerns, their lack of knowledge about the financial industry, and their unpretentious, down to earth approach to their finances.</p><p> The world of financial advice is highly competitive; learning how to build your business and increase your bottom line could be as simple as knowing how to communicate with your prospects. Understanding their communication style from the very first point of connection (phone call or meeting) through every interaction over the lifetime of the client relationship could be critical to the sustainability of your business.</p><h3> Advisors need to understand their own communication and behavioral style up front before the first meeting. </h3><p> <br/> This insight will enable advisors to uncover client communication styles and enable the advisor to adjust their approach in order to effectively engage their client into the conversation.</p><p> If as an advisor you are genuinely able to communicate your interest in talking to the client, once they have revealed that their financial status is middle-class or below, you will build confidence in the client and begin the process of developing the relationship. As an advisor it&rsquo;s critical to the process not only to be client focused but to be able to uncover information that will result in sound and appropriate advice being given.</p><p> Seeking financial advice is a big step for many people. The industry needs to better understand their behavior and communication from the perspective of potential clients. Only then will it truly be able to know the right questions to ask potential clients.</p><p> <strong>  You never really know a man until you understand things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&rdquo; &ndash; Lee, Harper.

    "link": "top-5-things-you-need-to-know-about-generation-z-and-generation-alpha",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> All the talk these days is about how to connect with millennials, the generation roughly defined as including those born between 1980 and 2000. But what about all of the fine young lads and lasses that come after them: <strong>  how familiar are you with Generation Z and Generation Alpha? </strong> If you haven&rsquo;t stumbled across either term before, here&rsquo;s a primer:</p><li> Generation Z includes those born from the mid-to-late 1990s through 2010 (though some say this cohort extends through 2025). According to a recent  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2015/11/06/7-things-employers-should-know-about-the-gen-z-workforce/#44b41e68fad7\" target=\"_blank\">   Forbes  </a> </u>  piece (which offers a narrower definition of Generation Z), this generation accounts for 25% of the U.S. population &mdash; more than Baby Boomers or millennials.</li><li> Generation Alpha, which is sometimes (incorrectly?) used interchangeably with Generation Z, refers specifically to those born after 2010. According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/fashion/meet-alpha-the-next-next-generation.html\" target=\"_blank\">   New York Times  </a> </u> , there are 2.5 million members of Generation Alpha born each week; when all is said and done, there will be more than 2 billion Alphas by 2025. (Head over to  <u>  <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/13-things-alpha-generation/302366/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AdAge  </a> </u>  for a funny take on what Generation Alpha is like today.)</li>It&rsquo;s probably too soon for businesses to start marketing directly to members of Generation Alpha, but some of the oldest members of Generation Z are beginning to enter the workforce and piece together disposable income of their own.With that in mind, here are five things to keep in mind about members of these younger generations:<h3> <strong>  1. They will never know a world without social media </strong></h3>It&rsquo;s true, some of the older members of Generation Z might have a few years&rsquo; worth of memories that don&rsquo;t include hanging out on social media. But most of the folks in that group &mdash; and certainly all of those in Generation Alpha &mdash; simply won&rsquo;t be aware of a world that exists without social media.<h3> <strong>  2. To say technology comes naturally to them is an understatement </strong></h3>It seems the youngest generations are born with an intuitive knowledge of technology. In fact, members of Generation Z (and Generation Alpha when they come of age) don&rsquo;t even think about technologies as tools, according to a <u> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/generation-alpha-2014-7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Business Insider </a></u> article. Instead, they integrate technologies directly into their lives. Perhaps for this reason, experts believe members of Generation Alpha might begin school earlier and study longer than those who came before them.<h3> <strong>  3. They won&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to shop in a store </strong></h3>The U.S. mobile commerce market grew from $75 billion in 2014 to $104 billion in 2015, according to <u> <a href=\"https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/08/18/mobile-commerce-now-30-all-us-e-commerce\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Internet Retailer </a></u>, representing 25% and 30% of the entire e-commerce market respectively. We can reasonably expect these numbers to climb even higher this year as more people become comfortable buying things on their smartphones and tablets. To this end, one can only imagine how big the m-commerce market (and e-commerce market, too, for that matter) will be when members of Generation Z and Generation Alpha come of age. It&rsquo;s safe to say these people will be doing a lot of their shopping electronically.<h3> <strong>  4. They&rsquo;re worried about finding a job </strong></h3>If you think it was hard being a kid, imagine being worried about finding a job after college before you&rsquo;ve even graduated high school. According to <u> <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/22/generation-z-in-the-workplace/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Fortune </a></u>, in a recent survey nearly one-third of Generation Z students indicated that finding a job after graduation is their top concern. Maybe it&rsquo;s because technology has connected them with what&rsquo;s going on in the world. In any event, it&rsquo;s evident that members of these younger generations plan ahead, to say the least.<h3> <strong>  5. They&rsquo;re entrepreneurial </strong></h3>According to <u> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2015/11/06/7-things-employers-should-know-about-the-gen-z-workforce/\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes </a></u>, more than half of Generation Z members who were surveyed indicated they&rsquo;d like to start their own business. Though members of Generation Alpha are still crawling, waddling, and running into walls, we can assume this trend will continue, and our youngest will similarly be drawn to entrepreneurial endeavors.There&rsquo;s still some time before you&rsquo;re likely to see a lot of Generation Z applicants for the next job posting you put out. And members of Generation Alpha won&rsquo;t apply for more than a decade. Still, it&rsquo;s worth knowing what makes members of these generations tick so you&rsquo;re ready to accommodate them as employees or market to them more effectively as customers.",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/danielle-stitt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Danielle Stitt  </a> </u></p><h3> Is it possible to give the CFO harder metrics and demonstrate the benefits of marketing campaigns?</h3><p> <br/> The answer is yes, within reason.</p><p> Ever thought your CFO might secretly believe that marketing is nothing more than a necessary evil, not directly connected to bottom line profitability? It&rsquo;s true.</p><p> Ok they MAY believe marketing supports overall business strategy, but in a nebulous and unquantifiable way. So marketing is first cab off the rank when belts need tightening. </p><p> In a showdown it&rsquo;s the CFO who will win - a recent Active International  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.activeinternational.com/cmos-and-cfos-collision-or-collaboration\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   survey  </a> </u>  found that it is the CFO and not the CMO who will carry the day. For example, even Twitter called on its CFO to stand in as CMO while they searched for a new one.</p><p> Much more will be achieved if the CFO and CMO can be friends. The CFO might be focused on controlling cash flows and the balance sheet and the CMO on driving brand and growth, but the reality is that you can&rsquo;t have one without the other.</p><p> And given the CFO usually controls the purse strings, it is incumbent on the CMO to demonstrate that marketing is an asset and not a cost centre.</p><h3> Showing the CFO the money isn&rsquo;t always easy</h3><p> <br/> The problem for the CMO can be summed up in the words of a recent Business Insider  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.in/Twitters-CFO-just-explained-why-on-earth-the-company-put-its-finance-guy-in-charge-of-marketing/articleshow/47371532.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   article  </a> </u> . </p><p> &ldquo;The CFO wants proof that the money they delegated to marketing last quarter is actually delivering a return for the business, but marketing can take time to have an effect on sales, which leaves marketers fumbling around for other, softer metrics, like awareness, affinity, recall and social media engagement.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s clearly a challenge, but there are plenty of high-profile converts to the view.</p><p> In fact, in a recent conversation (above) with <strong>  BlueChip&rsquo;s Carden Calder, HubSpot&rsquo;s COO, JD Sherman </strong> ( <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_d_sherman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @J_D_Sherman  </a> </u> ), previously a CFO at Akami and IBM, actually described his conversion on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/the-content-marketing-road-to-damascus-are-we-there-yet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   road to Damascus  </a> </u>  &ndash; shocking himself with his now firm view that marketing assets, like content marketing, are actually the growth engines of a business. And done right can produce leads, nurture prospects and galvanise customers 24 hours a day.</p><p> So it possible to give the CFO harder metrics and demonstrate the benefits of marketing campaigns?</p><p> The answer is yes, within reason.</p><p> Two steps to start a conversation with cold hard numbers</p><h3> Step 1 - Get the numbers. <br/>  </h3><li> Take a good hard look at where you are now, and where you want to go</li><li> Conduct an audit. Analyse your website and your content. Talk to your staff and clients. Look objectively at past campaigns and analyse how you tracked against your performance objectives and goals. Focus on the efficacy and rigour of your data tracking</li><li> Do a gap analysis. Compare your position with best practice and most importantly, how well your campaigns supported business objectives</li><li> Create an action plan in two parts. Part one hones in on commercially optimised quick wins, part two on longer term aspirations <br/>  </li><h3> Step 2 &ndash; Decide what you can and can&rsquo;t deliver <br/>  </h3><li> Divide marketing into functions you should stop, start and continue. Stop those things which do not add value, start those which are required but are not currently being done, and continue those which are working well. Prioritise these functions</li><li> Make sure your data analytics are giving you the insights you need</li><li> Develop a plan. This can be a simple as an action plan to address gaps in light of what&rsquo;s possible now, to a full funnel marketing strategy and action plan. This means a calendar of activity, responsibilities, attribution tracking and recommended budget over 12 months <br/>  </li><h3> How will this help? <br/>  </h3><p> A proper audit and clear deliverables (with the help of an external partner if needed) is the best starting point for a CMO who would like to present an independent view, with relevant benchmarking of the ROI contribution of marketing to the business. If you can demonstrate what you are doing and how, and how you are tracking against agreed KPIs, the CFO is far more likely to understand what an effective marketing strategy looks like, and more importantly, to have your back when it comes to conversations about budget.</p><p> At the same time, it&rsquo;s important to understand, and to get the CFO to understand, that some marketing activities are long term in nature, take time to bear fruit, and can&rsquo;t be measured every week or even every quarter.</p><p> It isn&rsquo;t always sensible to KPI every activity, but leveraging your activities as part of a cohesive plan across all the marketing silos is.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> It&rsquo;s not all apples to apples when it comes to comparing one IBD to another</h3><p> <br/> While not that long ago it may have been enough for an independent broker dealer (IBD) simply to provide basic clearing and custody and perform mandatory regulatory oversight, advisors today expect much more. With so many options out there, what should an IBD advisor look for to ensure that either he is still in the right place or that any move he considers is the best one for his clients and his business goals?</p><p> Before starting any due diligence, it&rsquo;s important to have a strategy that begins with an advisor first &ldquo;checking in&rdquo; with himself to gain a true understanding of his requirements&mdash;what he&rsquo;s looking to accomplish for his clients and his business, and what he needs to fulfill his longer term vision.</p><p> You need to ask yourself:</p><p> &ldquo;Do I see myself with my current broker dealer (BD) five or 10 years from now?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;If I had to start over, would I still choose my current BD, given the options across the landscape and how my BD has changed?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;What do I wish my BD would do to better support me and help me reach my goals?&rdquo;</p><h3> An Assessment Based on 9 Requirements</h3><p> <br/> Whether this exercise is about determining if there is a better place or examining your current BD relationship by today&rsquo;s higher standards of service, <strong>  all quality BDs should, at a minimum, offer the following: </strong></p><li> A robust platform with access to financial and estate planning, trust, insurance, lending and alternatives&mdash;one that will allow you to capture clients of all sizes including niche business.</li><li> Best-in-class technology with the financial strength and commitment to make this ongoing investment.</li><li> The sophistication and expertise to anticipate, understand and prepare for regulatory changes, and respond by creating policies and practices that are appropriate for high-quality, top advisors and not merely designed to manage to the lowest common denominator.</li><li> Support for business growth&mdash;both inorganic and organic. Acting as a strategic partner by providing help with inorganic growth such as recruiting, identifying acquisition possibilities, providing access to capital and expertise; and organic strategies including marketing support for new client development and the tools to support the business you want to develop.</li><li> Practice management support including operational support to maximize your team&rsquo;s efficiency and the profitability of the business.</li><li> Succession planning assistance by helping to develop next-gen talent through training, recruiting and human resource development.</li><li> Best practices for wealth management and investment management represented by the ability to associate and share thought leadership with like-minded individuals.</li><li> Fair and transparent economics so you are able to readily understand the payout and the true costs of associating with a BD, and they should be well aligned with how you do your business.</li><li> An accessible, responsive and knowledgeable support team that makes themselves available to you with answers that are meaningful and help, not hinder, your business processes. <br/>  </li><h3> Based on the above 9 criteria, you may find that your current BD is lacking.</h3><p> <br/> And certainly it&rsquo;s no secret that many options exist within the IBD space. Then why is it that some advisors do opt to stay where they are? <strong>  Typically, they fall within one or more of the following 3 categories: </strong></p><li> They assume that all BDs are essentially the same and nothing better exists.</li><li> They are simply &ldquo;comfortable enough&rdquo;. While they have some frustrations, they are able to make it work. The challenges don&rsquo;t yet impact their ability to accomplish what they need to, and they are still able to insulate clients from whatever imperfections exist.</li><li> They find the array of choices overwhelming and confusing. It&rsquo;s easier to stay than to take on the additional burden of exploration and moving a business. <br/>  </li><p> If you aren&rsquo;t sure that your BD is the right one to support you today and for the long haul &ndash; that is, for the business as it looks today and the business you aspire to build &ndash; know that you are entitled to ask for more, and it&rsquo;s out there if you know where to look. Taking a close look at the landscape and ensuring that you are comparing one to another on the right set of criteria will help an advisor take much of the complexity out of a dizzying array of choices.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Faced with a decision between a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k)?  You need to predict your tax rates now and at retirement &hellip; or you can elect to hedge your bets. </p><h3> Roth or not to Roth?  <br/> Deciding requires predicting your future tax rate</h3><p> <br/> As more employers provide the option of a Roth 401(k), you may be faced with this question: Which should contribute to a Roth 401(k) or a traditional 401(k)?</p><p> The answer depends on your income tax rate now and at retirement.  But before offering any explanation, here is some background:</p><h3> <strong>  How the Plans Work: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> Tax deferred growth</h3><p> <br/> Earnings on both the traditional 401(k) and the Roth 401(k) are not taxed.  Not paying taxes on investments in your retirement account means more grows and compounds tax-free &ndash; that is why contributing to a retirement plan is so important. </p><h3> Contributions </h3><p> <br/> Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made &ldquo;pre-tax,&rdquo; meaning that the amount contributed is excluded from your taxable income for the year. </p><p> Contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made after tax &ndash; they are not excluded from taxable income. </p><h3> Withdrawals</h3><p> <br/> Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) are taxed in the year of withdrawal.  </p><p> Withdrawals from the Roth plans are not taxed.  </p><h3> Other rules</h3><p> <br/> There are penalties for withdrawal before reaching age 59&frac12;, unless certain exceptions are met, and you must begin withdrawing when you reach age 70&frac12; under the IRS Required Minimum Distribution or <u>  &ldquo;RMD&rdquo; rules </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Deciding into which Plan you should Contribute: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> If you have a high tax rate now, and expect a low tax rate later, pick the traditional 401(k)  </h3><p> <br/> The traditional plan is better because get the current tax deduction, reducing taxes now at the higher tax rate.  This may be true for people in middle or later years of employment. </p><p> Note: this is only financially better if you invest the amount of taxes saved. </p><h3> If you have a low tax rate now, and expect a high tax rate later, pick the Roth 401(k)</h3><p> <br/> The Roth plan is better because you avoid higher taxes later.  This may be true for most people starting work now. </p><h3> If expect your tax rate later will be the same as it is now, pick the Roth 401(k) </h3><p> <br/> The Roth plan has other benefits described below.</p><h3> <strong>  Hedging your bets: </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> If you are not sure of your tax rates, or if you just want more options because you cannot predict, then you can opt to combine plans.  For example, you can contribute to your traditional 401(k) up to the employer match and then put the rest in a Roth IRA, if the contribution limits allow. </p><h3> <strong>  Conversions: </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> When you change jobs, you can convert a 401(k) to a Roth IRA, but doing so is a taxable event.  If you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future, this is a good move.  However, you will want to pay taxes due from other sources.  If you have to take funds from the IRA to pay the taxes, you reduce the amount going into the Roth IRA which dramatically reduces the future benefit. </p><p> If you convert after-tax contributions made to a traditional 401(k) or non-deductible IRA, you have less on which taxes are due because the after-tax portion is not taxed in converting to a Roth IRA. </p><h3> <strong>  Other considerations: </strong></h3><p> <br/> While a Roth 401(k) is subject to RMD, a Roth IRA is not.  If you can re-characterize the Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA, you avoid the RMD.  This may mean that you pass more on to your heirs.  Also, you may gain investment flexibility compared to a company plan.  </p><p> If you use a Roth plan, then your taxable income at retirement will be less than if you were withdrawing from a traditional plan where withdrawals are taxed.  This could lessen tax due on social security benefits.   </p><p> On the other hand, if you expect to use funds in your retirement plan to donate to a charity, you are better off getting the tax savings for yourself now.  The charity is not subject to much if any income tax.</p><p> Also, if you expect your heirs to receive your retirement plan assets and know that those heirs will be in a lower income tax bracket, you should use a traditional plan now to get the tax benefit for yourself.  How can you possibly determine that heirs will get more of your retirement than you and also be in a lower tax bracket?  I cannot imagine &ndash; well, maybe I can, but none of the ideas sound good.  Anyway, it seemed like a good idea to mention (they teach you to think this way in law school).</p>",

    "content": "<p> Everybody&rsquo;s talking about customer experience these days, but how many companies actually follow through to ensure that their customers are getting the best experience possible? <strong>  And how are they doing that? </strong></p><p> Everybody&rsquo;s heard the mantra, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to think like the customer,&rdquo; but unless you embed that into your company culture, and unless everybody from the top down has it embroidered on his/her brain, it&rsquo;s too easy to develop &ldquo;ease of use for me,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;ease of use for customer&rdquo; when thinking about systems and outcomes. And just &ldquo;thinking like the customer&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really enough to ensure a great experience. There are many business practices that need to dovetail correctly, as a business grows and develops more layers, this can get harder and harder to maintain.</p><p> However, I recently saw an article in Control Engineering that discussed a simple formula developed by Dennis Snow, a former Disney executive who now consults with organizations about designing great customer experiences. In the article, Snow talked about the top three things companies must do to ensure exemplary customer service:</p><li> <strong>  Look at everything through the customer&rsquo;s lens </strong></li><li> <strong>  Examine details </strong></li><li> <strong>  Impress your customers </strong> <br/>  </li><p> But what really struck me was the idea expressed in <strong>  No. 3, impressing the customer. </strong> There he talked about creating a &ldquo;customer expectation triangle&rdquo; as a benchmark for your efforts, as illustrated in the pyramid below.</p><p>  </p><a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/?p=5626\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"customer experience graphic\" src=\"http://23x6xj3o92m9361dbu2ij362.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/customer-experience-graphic.png\"/></a><p>  </p><p> In this diagram, the two lowest levels, Accuracy and Availability are expected by your consumer, right? You must get them right every time. Delivering what you say you&rsquo;re going to deliver and being accessible when your customers need you are critical.</p><p> However, the top two are opportunities to really &ldquo;wow&rdquo; your customers: teaching them something they didn&rsquo;t know (advice), and making them feel that you are &ldquo;partnering&rdquo; in their success. These are markers of great customer service that will keep people coming back to you&mdash;but you need to build them on top of delivering the expected criteria. Think back to your own best experiences as a customer. Chances are that all four of these were consistently done well.</p><h3> Enlist Employees to Help Design Your Success</h3><p> <br/> What struck me about this formula is that it&rsquo;s employee driven. Each of these four levels of service fail if your employees are not empowered to deliver them, which is why it&rsquo;s imperative to involve employees in all aspects of designing customer experience. It can&rsquo;t just be dictated to them&mdash;they have to feel invested in the outcome and excited about their part in it.</p><p> What if every employee in your company was taught to think in these terms with the goal of achieving all four levels in every interaction? What if they were empowered to come up with their own ideas on how these levels of service could be implemented? What if you could measure achievement of these goals at every level in your company, and put a system in place to reward those achievements? I think you&rsquo;d be on fire!</p><p> Engineering customer experience means engineering your company, your systems and your culture so your employees can deliver that experience&mdash;and keep delivering it. Is it easy to do? No. But if you want to be more than just another competitor in your niche and develop relationships with your customers that result in loyalty and advocacy, it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.</p><p> Designing great customer experiences might not be easy, but it&rsquo;s amazing what can be accomplished in the right environment. Some of the greatest achievements of this age began with a simple, clear vision that grew. As Walt Disney once said, &ldquo;If you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember that this whole thing was started by a mouse.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Empower you Employees and they will Power your Brand! </strong></p><p> Originally posted on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ted Rubin  </u> </a> .</p>",

    "content": "<h3> How often have you had a feeling when something wasn&rsquo;t quite right?</h3><p> <br/> It might be a clench in the pit of your stomach, hmm possibly a stomach ache, or not. Or the ping you may hear, not your cell phone, or the chill as the hair on the back of your neck stands up and you realize something is about to happen, but what?  </p><p> You feel something is a little off, and maybe you can&rsquo;t pin point it right away, or don&rsquo;t take the time to connect the dots. Instead, you chose to ignore it and continue going about your life.</p><p> These experiences have happened to all of us at one time or another. Our angels whisper to us, tap us on the shoulder, and sometimes nudge us a bit more. Occasionally we end up on the doorstep of catastrophe because we aren&rsquo;t willing to slow down and connect to our instincts.</p><p> Not too long ago my husband was hit by a moving fork lift. He was thrown about 30 feet. Yes, you read that correctly and yes, he actually got up! And like all of us, he&rsquo;s got so much happening at once, but I had to wonder if this wasn&rsquo;t the universe giving him a big wake-up call.</p><p> Right before he was hit he looked down to get his phone, which was ringing, out of his pocket. Something he normally doesn&rsquo;t do on a job site, but on that day he was compelled to answer the call. By bending his neck down, the impact of the hit sent his head to a neutral position, as opposed to whipping it back and causing severe whiplash.</p><h3> So what&rsquo;s the message? Does he need to do less, slow down, pay more attention?</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m not sure, and that&rsquo;s for him to figure out. However, this incident got me thinking about hunches and following instincts.</p><p> Right now, today, make the commitment to begin listening. Listen to that little voice, become aware of the tap on your shoulder, the chills on the back of your neck, or whatever sensations connect you to your instincts. Give yourself permission to process the feelings flowing through you at this exact moment. Slow down and filter the information while you digest what the message is and what your other options may be.</p><p> You might think it&rsquo;s easier to follow the roadmap later, put the pieces of the puzzle together next week, but when does next week ever come. Taking time to spontaneously connect to your instincts, in that exact moment, can make a big difference. The impulse to keep going and decipher all the signs at another time is human nature, especially since you have so many things on the daily to-do list. You think it&rsquo;s impossible to take time for something that isn&rsquo;t yet on the list. </p><p> This is the path that needs your persistence. The rewards are often unknown, but sometimes they are the awakening that can change your life.</p><p> Continue to listen, watch, and connect, as the life you save may be your own, literally. Continue Consciously Connecting and your instincts will tell you when to return.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Last time we talked about the <a href=\"/advisor/how-well-do-you-know-your-financial-advisor-5-questions-you-should-ask\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   five questions  </u> </a>  you should be asking when talking to financial advisors to determine their ability to manage your family&rsquo;s financial affairs.</p><p> Now that you have a financial advisor, it's time for a financial planning checkup: What questions should you ask to find out whether the two of you are on the right track to meeting your financial goals? </p><h3> Your Financial Planning Checkup <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1) How will you help me to reach my financial goals? </strong></p><p> Reaching your financial goals starts by looking at where you are at today, where you want to be in the future and how you will get there. In other words, you need to have a financial plan.</p><p> <strong>  2) Do I have a plan? </strong></p><p> A lot of people think they have a financial plan when in fact; they just have a brief overview of where they are at financially or recommendation on how they should be investing. That is great to have but it&rsquo;s not a detailed personalized financial plan.</p><p> Why is a plan important? Imagine you are taking a family vacation driving across country. Before you start your adventure you will assess where you are right now (location, your vehicle, and your resources) and how you are going to get to your desired destination:</p><li> Will you need a road map?</li><li> How will you decide on what routes to take?</li><li> How much gas you will need?</li><li> Where you will stop over?</li><li> What clothes will you need to pack?</li><li> How much food will you need to bring?</li><li> How much will this cost?</li><p> This is your travel plan. A financial plan is no different; it should tell you where you are today (what you own and what you owe, how you are spending your money or what is coming in and what is going out) and where you want to be regarding your financial goals (savings for your kids&rsquo; education, buying a home, paying down your debt, protecting your income, saving for retirement). A financial plan is a road map, or detailed instructions, on what you need to be doing today to reach or achieve your future goals.</p><p> <strong>  3) Will having a financial plan guarantee that I reach my financial goals? </strong></p><p> Well, unfortunately, no. Your financial plan is a life-long journey. Unless you are fortunate enough to have a financial life that never has any bumps in the road, you will need to review your plan regularly and make room for life changes, such as family illness, losing your job, forced retirement, or divorce. Life events can&rsquo;t always be predicted; sometimes you are just plain sideswiped. However, proper planning can help to minimize the financial impact when they occur.</p><p> Review your financial plan annually with your financial advisor unless a life event occurs. If something important or unexpected happens in your life, let your advisor know right away and meet soon after to make any necessary adjustments needed to your plan.</p><p> <strong>  4) Is my retirement plan on track to meet my goals? </strong></p><p> Retirement is usually the biggest component of a financial plan, as you may conceivably have to pay for 20 or more years of living. If you don&rsquo;t have a company pension plan or are worried about government pensions, then your personal savings will be responsible to cover the majority of your retirement living costs. Start saving EARLY and save as much as you can!</p><p> The closer you are to retirement, the more important it is to keep a close eye on your retirement plan, your long-term goals and day-to-day spending. Even if it&rsquo;s awkward, you should be able to open up to your financial advisor about concerns you have about whether your job or marriage is secure. Do you need to make plans to care for a disabled child or are there other special circumstances in your life that need to be accounted for in your financial plan?</p><p> <strong>  5) What happens to my plan after I retire? </strong></p><p> Planning doesn&rsquo;t stop once you reached your retirement goals; instead it shifts to retirement income planning which is an approach that will help you to wisely draw down on your savings to sustain you throughout the rest of your life. We are living longer and we want to be sure we have enough money to cover day-to-day expenses as well as the unexpected. How we invest and spend our money in the early years of retirement greatly impacts our financial wellbeing later on. Ask your financial advisor for a retirement income plan as you enter into your golden years to be sure you are on track.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently published a list of  <u>  <a href=\"http://jaypalter.ca/2016/01/fintech-influencers-to-follow-in-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   250 #fintech influencers  </a> </u>  that ought to be on the radar of any startup, investor, incumbent business, or interested observer in the banking and financial services space.</p><p> In publishing this data and discussing it with lots of folks, it became clear to me that many people see the value of this data in its ranking of individual #fintech influencers. While the data is clearly useful in this way, there are more strategic uses for this kind of influencer that often seem to be overlooked.</p><p> This article seeks to identify several common use case scenarios for influencer data and briefly outlines how this information can be used strategically in these scenarios.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s start with a few of the most common use case scenarios:</p><h3> <strong>  1. INFLUENCING: You want to become a #fintech influencer </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> There are many people that are active and influential in the #fintech space who could benefit by increasing their online visibility. Perhaps you&rsquo;re a #fintech startup CEO, an investor, or a journalist and you want to establish your profile and increase your visibility within the #fintech community. Or maybe you&rsquo;re already on the list and want to move up.</p><h3> <strong>  2. COMMUNICATING: You want to get your message out to the #fintech community </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The people on the #fintech influencers list have accumulated a targeted group of followers who trust them and rely on their informative content feeds. Perhaps you are promoting a conference, a publication or a specialized consulting practice focused on the #fintech sector. This is a group you want to get you message out to.</p><h3> <strong>  3. LISTENING: You want to stay on top of #fintech news and developments </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Maybe your primary interest is in staying on top of news and developments in the rapidly changing #fintech space. Paying attention to the discussions and content shared among #fintech influencers is an efficient and powerful way to filter vast amounts of information and get a sense of what they&rsquo;re talking about &ndash; and not talking about.</p><p> Having established a number of use case scenarios, let&rsquo;s look at some tactical ways the #fintech influencer data can be leveraged.</p><p> Before looking at the tactical uses, though, we need to understand the breadth of data that is available. First, the top 250 #fintech influencers come from a dataset containing almost 7,000 online identities. The data includes location data, links to other social media profiles such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+, as well as supplementary sites like blogs.</p><h3> <strong>  How to grow your influence </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> If you wanted to increase your own influence and position yourself as a top influencer in the #fintech space, you should consider undertaking the following activities:</p><li> Start by clarifying your personal brand and defining how you want to be seen online. This is important work, but is often overlooked.</li><li> Next, follow many of the top #fintech influencers on Twitter in daily groupings in order to abide by Twitter&rsquo;s restriction against aggressive following.</li><li> Actively curating and sharing relevant information from top influencers on a daily basis is one of the best ways to increase visibility, ensuring that you mention influencers when they are authors or sources of the content.</li><li> Finally, seek opportunities to participate in and add value to industry discussions. This is easier said than done, but typically involves a publishing platform (such as, your blog) and a strong listening component (see below). <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Earning the right to tell your story </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Most people and businesses have a message to communicate in social networks, but an influencer list is not best approached with a bullhorn in hand. A more nuanced approach would take into consideration the following:</p><li> Initiate LinkedIn connection requests with key influencers who you&rsquo;ve already interacted with on Twitter. Twitter engagement is more open and informal, whereas LinkedIn connections require mutual consent and is often reserved for people you already know. Once connected, share relevant information and mention influencers in regular LinkedIn updates.</li><li> Look for opportunities to move conversations offline, such as seeking out influencers at industry conferences or even arranging introductory phone calls &ndash; but only after initially &ldquo;breaking the ice&rdquo; via digital exchanges, usually via Twitter. The direct message (DM) function on Twitter is a great way to virtually tap someone on the shoulder and suggest a call.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t push your message on people until you&rsquo;ve earned the right to.Focus on investing in and growing your network of influencers for at least 6-12 months before making any substantive asks.</li><li> Look for ways to help influencers expand their audience and reach by referencing them in blog posts and articles, featuring them in your webinars and podcasts, etc. People will always reciprocate when someone gives without asking for anything in return. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  You&rsquo;ve got two ears and one mouth, so listen </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Listening is central to both of the aforementioned use case scenarios. Social networks are highly conversational and conversations can&rsquo;t exist without listening. Here are some tips for listening to #fintech influencers most effectively:</p><li> Try creating Twitter lists of key influencers based on subgroups you want to monitor and/or pay attention to more closely.</li><li> Broaden the social profiles that you monitor for key influencers to include Facebook pages, Google+ and Instagram accounts, if they are active in those social networks.</li><li> Consider procuring commercial listening tools that sift through mountains of data and identify most highly shared content and popular discussions within the #fintech space.</li><li> Assemble a team to help you listen. Get more people in your company listening to their networks and sharing their insights and intelligence internally. And leverage external consultants and subject matter experts to help you. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  It&rsquo;s called social networking </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> These are fairly generic tactical steps that can be applied to any group of influencers, not just #fintech ones.</p><p> And these tactics are more akin to networking and public relations, than sales or marketing. That&rsquo;s because influencers are not typically your sales prospects &ndash; but their followers may be your best prospects.</p><p> By building genuine relationships and engagement with online influencers, you can increase your visibility, gain valuable social proof and meet some amazingly smart and generous people along the way.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Used correctly, factor investing may perform better than traditional beta, enhancing risk management and diversification within a portfolio and providing opportunities to improve risk-adjusted returns versus market weighted indexes. Though multifactor investing may sound like an option solely available in an active strategy, technological advances, regulatory requirements and greater innovation are changing the active versus passive debate.</p><p> How factors tie to a goal can involve several issues. Different goals require different factor considerations. Selecting the proper factors for the goal and how those factors are combined are crucial. It is also very important to understand the different combination strategies and how they differ. Investors considering factor-investing products need to look at how the products work and ask questions about the process. Understanding the &ldquo;whats&rdquo; and the &ldquo;whys&rdquo; behind any fund sponsor&rsquo;s &ldquo;smart beta&rdquo; or multifactor fund is important to effectively managing your portfolios.</p><h3> <strong>  INNOVATIONS IN EQUITY ALLOCATION LEAD TO &ldquo;SMART BETA&rdquo; </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> In recent years, accommodative monetary policy around the globe has driven investors to pursue other portfolio allocation options away from the legacy 60% equity-40% fixed income investing framework. Today, they are more willing to accept new approaches, new areas of investing, new ways of thinking and, consequently, innovative approaches to equity allocation.</p><p> Examples of equity product innovation abound and a major result has been an embrace of indexing at multiple levels. Currency hedge strategies associated with an international index can now be implemented via a single trade. Equities are also being used to access commodities through natural resource ETFs. Infrastructure, once limited for average investors mostly to private equity, direct investment, or utilities, are now accessible through various strategies or funds.</p><p> Even more important, however, is the evolution of the beta concept to &ldquo;smart beta.&rdquo; This transition moves investors away from the traditional market capitalization concept and bases investment selection on one or even multiple factors or characteristics. </p><p> There is no question that traditional beta has historically provided investors with several advantages including the representation of an entire market through an indexing approach which includes the potential for low tracking error, 1 ease of maintenance, ease of trading and ease of reconstitution.</p><p> Used correctly, however, single and multi-factor investing may not only potentially perform better but also enhance risk management and diversification within a portfolio while providing opportunities to improve risk-adjusted returns versus market-weighted indexes. </p><p> Though multifactor investing may sound like an option solely available in an active strategy, technological advances, regulatory requirements and greater innovation are changing the active versus passive debate.</p><p> As Exhibit 1 shows, fund flows over the last several years reflect strong interest in non-traditionally weighted indexes in the wake of post-crisis de-risking.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-14-at-12.33.15-PM.png\" width=\"557\"/></p><h3> <b>  WHAT EXACTLY IS SMART BETA? </b></h3><p> <br/> Smart beta is actually an umbrella term for investment strategies that utilize alternative methods to construct indexes as opposed to traditional market capitalization weighting. Smart beta emphasizes various investment factors or characteristics in a rules-based and transparent way. Such strategies are often called multifactor investing.</p><p> The smart beta concept can be traced back to academic research, specifically the capital asset pricing model created by Bill Sharpe in the 1960s. Sharpe turned the algebraic equation for a straight line into a market changing theory. His research determined that sensitivity to market volatility in a given security or portfolio, which he labeled beta, explained 70% to 75% of investors&rsquo; returns. The other 25% to 30% he considered alpha. 2</p><p> Expounding on Sharpe&rsquo;s research, Eugene Fama and Ken French&rsquo;s seminal work in 1992 found that, while beta was the most explanatory factor, size and value were also important in illuminating portfolio performance. They determined that the level of exposure to value and small capitalization stocks, alongside beta, explained 90% or more of returns, leading to the identification of value and small cap as compensated risk factors. Later in the 1990s, Mark Carhart&rsquo;s research added a fourth factor, momentum. His research found that when momentum was combined with beta, value and capitalization, at least 95% of returns were explainable.</p><p> Today, smart beta strategists apply various multifactor approaches not to explain returns, but rather as a way to get incremental returns into the portfolio and outperform a market-weighted portfolio over the long term.</p><h3> <b>  HOW ETFS CAN HELP </b></h3><p> <br/> Factor investing is no longer necessarily &ldquo;active&rdquo; in the sense that it was formerly understood. The financial landscape that has evolved across the last few decades&mdash;driven largely by financial turbulence&mdash;presents challenges for individual stock-pickers. An exponential increase in access to information for all investors, low latency and high frequency trading and the explosion in computing power all contribute to the end of unofficial projections of performance that historically circulated quietly among institutional investors.</p><p> As advantages for active traders evaporated, the use of factor investing began to rise. In early iterations, single-factor weighted portfolios emerged. Over the last several years, however, quantitative analysis showed a dispersion of factors, with the array of metrics responding differently in the most recent bout of financial disruption. The conclusion was that investors might better enable diversification and manage risk in a portfolio through multiple factor exposures that were not attainable by simply being invested in an index of an entire equity market.</p><p> Improvements in technology are permitting easier, more efficient factor capture, allowing research, replication and application in real-world scenarios. Concurrently, passive indexing has grown over the last two decades as a successful way to access equity markets. Smart (or strategic) beta products provide a rules-based framework to combine benefits of both.</p><p> ETFs offer an additional level of transparency and consistent approach to factor access that active managers simply do not. Any changes in the index portfolio, as identified by ongoing research, are announced so that investors can prepare. On the other hand, most active managers report holdings on a quarterly basis and if there is a change in the methodology of how they capture or alter exposure to a specific factor, it is made public after the fact.</p><h3> <b>  FLEXIBLE INDEXING: PUTTING INVESTOR OBJECTIVES FIRST </b></h3><p> <br/> The FlexShares approach to index design is investor-centric. Whether institutional or individual, investors have real-world investment objectives that we organize into four basic goals: growing assets, managing risk, generating income and maintaining liquidity. Before considering asset class, FlexShares considers how best to achieve the given goal. Which factors we choose and their tied to the goal are critical.</p><p> To qualify for inclusion in an index&rsquo;s design, factors must persist over time. We begin with skepticism that potential factors are simply anomalies of a particular economic, regulatory or theoretical period. Our analysis looks to ensure factors that are consistent through time and across markets. Any potential characteristics not borne out by research or empirical evidence will not persist in the future and do not maintain their efficacy. They are simply not valid.</p><p> How factors tie to a goal can involve several issues. Different goals require different factor considerations. For example, in a capital appreciation strategy, we must look at various time windows: long, intermediate or short-term factors. We also must focus on the best way to mitigate risk.</p><p> Selecting the proper factors for the goal and how those factors are combined is crucial. It is also very important to understand the different combination strategies and how they differ.</p><li> <b>  Target each factor independently. </b> Create sub-indices and combine into one process. In our opinion, this is an inefficient approach. The separate sub index for each factor combined will each contain some equities that do not qualify.</li><li> <b>  Apply selected factors in succession. </b> This may arguably be better than targeting each alone but in reality, only the last factor applied will be maximized.</li><li> <b>  Target all factors, in concert. </b> Combining factors that are negatively correlated 3 with one another. This process works to &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; the factor cycle, not only eliminating equities that do not meet the various factor criteria, but also maximizing exposure to those that do. <br/>  </li><p> A simplified example of how the third strategy may be the most beneficial to portfolio performance is to look at investing in the quality factor. Top-quality companies carry a premium (they are generally overvalued) and therefore provide less excess return. Companies with stronger performance are undervalued. Combining quality and value factors simultaneously may identify high-quality companies that are undervalued.</p><p> Though equities presented the most logical starting point for factor investing, due to the depth and breadth of historical data, we are also applying factor investing in our fixed income products.</p><h3> <b>  ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS </b></h3><p> <br/> A combination of traditional market-weighted and factor investing, using the right factors of course, may work best to avoid risk and gain exposure for broader diversification and return. Advisors considering factor-investing products need to look at how the products work and ask questions about the process. Understanding the &ldquo;whats&rdquo; and the &ldquo;whys&rdquo; behind any fund sponsor&rsquo;s smart beta or multifactor products is important to effectively managing your portfolio.</p><p> Ask how a particular product may fit within the portfolio. Ask about the goal of the product. Is it capital appreciation, minimizing volatility, other? Ask why the particular factors were selected, how they were combined and how they tie to the goal. No factor is a &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; that works in all market environments. Factors go through cycles and it is important to research when you may be able to expect various factors to underperform and why? Conversely, understanding in what market situation might they potentially outperform?</p><p> What is the future of factor investing? How can it be improved? As the evolution of smart beta continues, we see the emergence of &ldquo;refined multifactor models,&rdquo; exhibiting more and better ways to potentially capture factor exposures; more efficient factor capture for sustained performance over time and increased focus on how best to combine factors for maximized return. This is all part of our intellectual pursuit to improve the science of asset management at FlexShares.</p><h3> <b>  PURSUING QUALITY AS A FACTOR </b></h3><p> <br/> The word &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; appears rather frequently in the FlexShares product group. As a demonstration of our research methodology, here is a synopsis of our approach to identifying quality companies.</p><p> Our quality research was initially based on an income generation mandate. The question we posed was, &ldquo;How do you gain confidence that a given company&rsquo;s dividend is well-covered and capable of growing over time?&rdquo; In other words, we looked to avoid overpaying for yield. After pursuing various methodologies &mdash; dividend history, financials, a momentum factor &mdash; we found that what worked best was to look at the financial health of the company. We applied three lenses to our study:</p><li> <b>  Management efficiency. </b> We found that capital deployment is actually the hallmark of management efficiency. The more aggressive managers are in their capital deployment, the more likely they are to be poor-quality companies.</li><li> <b>  Profitability. </b> This is our way of judging competitive advantage. Companies that are in a stronger competitive position tend to do better because they have the ability to take advantage of new opportunities. Such companies more often dictate to the environment rather than being reactive, whether in an up or down market.</li><li> <b>  Cash flow. </b> This factor is critical &mdash; and universal. We have found it to be a strong indictor across all markets, not just dividend payers. We have applied this lens in our real estate product, our recently launched quality large cap product and several international products as well. <br/>  </li><p> For information please visit us <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-multifactor-investing-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>2 A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis.

    "content": "<h3> In the B2B sales world, there&rsquo;s been a lot of chatter about how relationship selling doesn&rsquo;t work, how &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not about relationships anymore.&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Believe me&mdash;it is.</p><p> The foundation of every great relationship you have in your life is trust. Sales is really no different. For sales teams to be more consultative, strategic, and valuable, they need to become trusted advisors.</p><p> So how do you build a team of trusted advisors?</p><p> In our interview with Anthony Iannarino, the mind behind  <u>  <a href=\"http://thesalesblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   thesalesblog.com  </a> </u> , we learned that the answer is to break that phrase down into its two parts: trust and advice, in that order.</p><h3> 1) Trust <br/>  </h3><p> Your sales team must establish trust before anything else. How do they do that?</p><p> They&rsquo;ve got to care enough about people to really help them. This means each salesperson has to have the difficult conversations with customers about the things they don&rsquo;t want to do.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the reality: if your customers could have changed things on their own and gotten the result they needed, they would have done it. And if your competitor could have given the customer the right insight, they would have done it. The reason salespeople lose a relationship is because they&rsquo;re not pushing hard enough to break through customer reluctance and be helpful.</p><p> You have the uncomfortable conversations, and you take yourself out of the equation. You say, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about me. It&rsquo;s about them; how do I help?&rdquo;</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say one of your salespeople goes out to see a prospect who is not getting a certain result he wants. He thinks that he should be able to change partners and change price and get the result he wants: in other words, get it better, faster, and cheaper.</p><p> Those three things are never, ever found together. Grownups know this. So the conversation has to be, &ldquo;Hey, I want to serve you, but here&rsquo;s what I know: you&rsquo;re underinvesting in the result you need, and I want to talk about whether it makes sense for you to spend a little more in this category to get results and lower your overall cost. You&rsquo;re losing money by not solving this problems: you just don&rsquo;t see that money in the same way.&rdquo;</p><p> Those conversations aren&rsquo;t fun, but people ultimately hire who they know, like, and trust. Somebody who&rsquo;s not willing to have hard conversations and think like a business partner can&rsquo;t build that trust.</p><p> The benefits of building trust, by the way, multiply themselves. According to  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EdelmanInsights/2016-edelman-trust-barometer-global-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the most recent Edelman Trust Barometer </a> , in the past year 59% of people recommended companies to a friend or colleague based on their own trust in those companies.</p><h3> 2) Advice <br/>  </h3><p> Building trust is paramount, but if you&rsquo;re going to be a trusted advisor, you&rsquo;ve got to have the &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; part down, too. So what do you know?</p><p> In addition to sales acumen, your team needs to have business acumen, i.e., how the client&rsquo;s and your businesses each work. Business acumen almost means knowing how the general economy fits in with various industries. As Anthony Iannarino told us, &ldquo;We need to listen to CNBC on our radio as much as we listen to Howard Stern.&rdquo;</p><p> In order to be successful, your salespeople need the ability to effect change inside an organization, and to help lead that change. That&rsquo;s what advisors do. So ask your team, &ldquo;What do you know about the biggest trends impacting our customers? Why should they be changing to us right now?&rdquo;</p><p> The modern salesperson is super-consultative. He or she is aware of all things impacting a client&rsquo;s business, whether political, economic, or technological.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> The best sales teams know how to first build trust, and then convey their industry knowledge through advice.</p><p> In order to reach the status of trusted advisors, your team has to differentiate themselves from the competition by having the hard conversations and staying completely up-to-date with industry trends.</p><p> Relationships still matter in the sales world. If they didn&rsquo;t, there would be no such thing as a &ldquo;trusted advisor.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<h3> If you&rsquo;ve been in the professional world, corporate or otherwise, for any length of time, you&rsquo;ve heard about the importance of communicating benefits. <br/>  </h3><p> Communicating benefits is one of those basic block and tackling skills that rarely get taught in high school, or even college for that matter (like balancing a checkbook &ndash; what&rsquo;s with that?), but something every professional needs to master.</p><p> The problem is that most of us understand the benefits-thing on a just a cerebral level. We understand that we should communicate them. We understand what to do. But like every skill, there&rsquo;s a vast difference between logically understanding something and really &ldquo;getting&rdquo; on a deep internal level, why it matters and how to authentically, mindfully, and effectively do it.</p><p> I remember, awhile back, shopping for a new sofa sectional. As a sectional can be a pretty big ticket item, you tend to get a lot of love from the furniture sales people. They, like many other professionals, have clearly taken something akin to Communicating Benefits 101. I was the recipient of a number of sectional-benefit-monologues that hit all the highlights: comfort, design, durability (with a very active kiddo at home, that one was a big deal). And even though they said the right things &ndash; they used the skill &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t have the impact that they were hoping for. I didn&rsquo;t buy.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not unusual for all of us, especially leaders, to fall into the furniture-sales-people-trap. We tend to get very focused on achieving the short-term goals in front of us and take what we perceive to be the fastest route to making stuff happen. We often say the right things but it&rsquo;s not having the impact we&rsquo;re hoping to have. People aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;buying&rdquo;.</p><p> I was doing some work not long ago with an organization that was quickly transforming from being a small company to a big company due to some major acquisitions. Change was happening at the speed of light. New processes and systems were being implemented left and right. Tensions were high. People were being told what to do. Leaders weren&rsquo;t taking the time to communicate the benefits around why things were being done and why it matters to, not just the company, but to the people involved in the changes themselves.</p><p> In other words, people didn&rsquo;t know why they should care. So they didn&rsquo;t (care, that is). They did the opposite. They did what they were told but were emotionally fighting it at every step &ndash; ensuring that the change would take longer, be less effective, and much more costly.</p><p> If you want people to care enough to support a change, they need to understand why things are being done and why it matters &ndash; not just to the company, but to the people involved.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t help but remember a project I was wrapping up a few years ago, during which I had been working with the same 22 people every month for six months, reviewing and building on what they&rsquo;ve learned. </p><p> At the end of the six months, as we were sharing around the room &ldquo;biggest take-aways&rdquo; and &ldquo;what (they&rsquo;ll) do differently&rdquo; a young leader said, &ldquo;My biggest take-away was the benefits thing. In the past, I didn&rsquo;t really care why something was important to my team; I just wanted them to do their job.  But now I realize that if I don&rsquo;t care, why should they?&rdquo;</p><p> When it comes to communicating benefits, we can say the right things. We can do the right things. We can check it off the list. But understanding how to use the skill won&rsquo;t get us there. We have to find a way to shift from logically understanding to really &ldquo;getting&rdquo; that if we as leaders don&rsquo;t genuinely care, neither will they.</p><p> If you don&rsquo;t genuinely care as a leader, neither will the people you lead.</p><p> Maybe authentically caring about what is truly most important to the people you want to have &ldquo;buy (in)&rdquo; is what it takes to really close the deal.</p>",

    "title": "6 Signs You Might Be Automatic Brain Dominant",
    "link": "6-signs-you-might-be-automatic-brain-dominant",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As I see it, every human being consists of a duality: one, a primitive nature manifested by the action of our automatic brain (AB) and two, a Divine nature accessed via our higher mind. The former is most dominant. After all, it has evolved over the past 250,000 years to protect us from danger, threat, or vulnerability by a very powerful mechanism&mdash;fight or flight. The mind, on the other hand, somehow came into existence just some 6,000 to 8,000 years ago (just so happens around the time of Biblical creation).</p><p> The AB shows itself in many ways, most of which we are unaware. And because we are unaware, it causes us to block access to our Divine nature, as the physical and emotional signs and symptoms it causes leads us to develop defenses. These defenses develop into personality traits, eventually formatting our belief systems.</p><p> How can we tell if we are AB dominant or not? It is actually quite simple, but it takes some real self-honesty, introspection, and real tough self-love. The first bit of tough love to swallow is that every single one of us is AB dominant. That&rsquo;s right&mdash;not just me; not just the other guy; but all of us, including you.</p><p> Once you have accepted this, it&rsquo;s time to move on, so you can get going and expose your Divine nature&mdash;the heart of your personal power, pure potential, true happiness and connection with a source that is more powerful than you can imagine.</p><p> So here are signs that you are AB dominant.</p><h3> 1. You accept being a victim <br/>  </h3><p> This takes some real tough self-love to admit. There is great power in assuming the role of victim and the AB designed to protect you from danger has evolved to recognize that. As a victim, you place others in a no-win position: if they deny you, they look insensitive; if they placate you, they end up resenting it. So you win; they lose. You get the attention you need and want. And your AB has caused you to one-up them; thus, you have successfully fought and fled into safety. But this will forever result in you Divine nature being elusive; hence, you really lose.</p><h3> 2. You have poor relationships <br/>  </h3><p> Many relationships are based on superficial needs and wants. Often lust is confused with love. Once the lust fades, our tendency is to start rationalizing why the relationship should remain. But this neglects the real reason, through the eyes of your AB that your relationship needs to survive: security. Neither party wants the vulnerability of being alone. The need for such insulation and protection is pure AB. Another way the AB sabotages relationships is when you either try to dominate another or allow yourself to be subservient to another.</p><h3> 3. You are physically unfit <br/>  </h3><p> I know, you think you were born that way; you have no choice. Or, you believe that you are genetically programmed to be unfit. Or, it runs in your family and you have no control. But in reality, being unfit is a result of following the AB drive of short-term gain at the expense of long-term pain. Self-control is a behavior characteristic of our mind and the chronic, habitual lack of it is AB driven to &ldquo;protect you&rdquo;. What could be protective about being unfit? It is not the unfit part, but what gets you there. It is the learned behavior from childhood&mdash;what you learned was familiar, comfortable, and normal; what would give you love and attention. If you grew up around unfit people, that was your normal and being like that would bring you love and acceptance. So your AB knows the unfamiliar or abnormal or anything that threatens love and attention represents potential danger and you will fight or flee that. You end up fighting and fleeing exactly what you want.</p><h3> 4. You are always financially strapped <br/>  </h3><p> No matter how much you protest it, money is the currency of our earth and the way that we express gratitude and appreciation for someone providing valuable goods and services. If you are unable to provide adequate food, clothing, and shelter for yourself or your family, it is likely that your AB detects some danger in doing so; whether it is the way you view yourself, money in general, or the relationship others have with money. You are fully gifted with the ability to provide, at least, the basics, so if you are not doing so, look to the AB as the culprit.</p><h3> 5. You label yourself <br/>  </h3><p> Any phrase that starts with &ldquo;I am&rdquo; is very powerful. And our 21st-century brain knows that. When you define yourself by a label that limits you, it becomes your familiar, your known, your comfort zone. So if you say, for instance, &ldquo;I am stubborn.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I am, compulsive.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I am a slob.&rdquo; &ldquo;Or, I am weak.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I am a diabetic.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I am bipolar.&rdquo; Well, guess what? Your AB will cause you to fight or flee back to those areas anytime you start to stray from them. Sure, there may be some truth in the statements, but when you dig your heels in and wear these labels as a badge of honor or some sort of self-definition, you will forever fail to escape from them and thus not reveal your mind, the gateway to your Divine nature.</p><h3> 6. You are chronically angry, quick to blame, always worrying, mired in guilt, forever resentful, and full of regret <br/>  </h3><p> These are the emotional faces of the AB. The Automatic Brain is primitive and animalistic. But since we humans are more evolved, more sophisticated, our fight or flight looks different than our cave-dwelling ancestors or wild animals. Instead, it comes out in recognizable emotions and personality traits. Anger is always a fight reaction and means that your AB has detected danger&mdash;perhaps being one-upped by someone disrespecting you at home or cutting you off on the highway, for instance. Blaming others or circumstances for your being stuck is a flight reaction, as you flee the danger of appearing weak or inadequate. Worrying is a way the AB tries to help you fight the unknown of the future. Guilt is a way someone uses their AB as a way to secure love and attention. Forever resentful is allowing your AB to cause you to be passive, thus fleeing confrontation as you end up doing something that really doesn&rsquo;t serve you. When you regret it is an effective way that your AB causes you to flee into the comfort of your misery.</p><p> Yes, we are a duality. Yet, our Divine nature is actually quite accessible when we don&rsquo;t believe, trust, and take direction from our AB. This is very difficult as it is the dominant functioning in our life in order to protect us. But in this 21st century, we don&rsquo;t need it to run 24/7 as it typically does below our level or awareness and consciousness. That is why we need to understand its dynamic and how to recognize it. Once we do, it unleashes us into our true gifts, talents, and God-given abilities. You can do it, but it will take some tough love...self-love.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> One of the great challenges when you&rsquo;re selling yourself is &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; your story so you can share it. <br/>  </h3><p> Crossing the gulf from just another fill-in-the-blank to utterly compelling means discovering the threads that tie together the intricate (and sometimes seemingly unrelated) events of your life.</p><p> And weaving them into THE story that dovetails perfectly into what you&rsquo;re doing right now.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the about page on your website. Your summary on LinkedIn. Your intro to future clients. </p><h3> Why Getting it exactly right matters <br/>  </h3><p> The second you have your story&mdash;your narrative&mdash;you have clarity.</p><p> Clarity that gives you confidence that you&rsquo;re on the right track, serving the right audience and doing the work only you can do.</p><p> Kierkegaard got it right when he said life could only be understood backwards.</p><p> And that&rsquo;s where you want to start. With your very first pivotal memories.</p><p> Get out your writing gear and make a list of your pivotal life and career experiences starting from your earliest conscious memories.</p><h3> Pivotal means pivotal to you! <br/>  </h3><p> It can be simple&mdash;as in the first time you played soccer you knew it would always be a key part of your life. Or profound&mdash;how the loss of your dream job translated into starting your own business.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t edit yourself. I like to write a sentence or two about each incident and then move on to the next one. But you might prefer to write mini-stories about your experiences to help you recapture the feelings of the time.</p><p> And keep your list open for at least a couple of weeks as memories&mdash;once they start flowing&mdash;will tend to sneak up on you at odd times.</p><h3> I guarantee there is gold in there <br/>  </h3><p> I once worked with a commercial contractor who was frustrated by his clients&rsquo; need to always get the lowest deal. He felt exhausted from never-ending price negotiations and was ready to close his doors on his (former) dream and go find a job instead.</p><p> When &ldquo;Jake&rdquo; did this exercise, his earliest memory was tagging along with his dad who made artisan bread in a bakery. That triggered other stories about learning to be an artisan himself&mdash;and doing intricate woodwork that had fallen by the wayside working with price-conscious clients. When we connected the dots, he realized in a nanosecond that he was working the wrong way for his talents. By telling his story differently, he began to attract clients who wanted a master rather than the cheapest deal.</p><h3> Owning your past <br/>  </h3><p> Here&rsquo;s the thing. You want to own your past, warts and all. That doesn&rsquo;t mean over-sharing (please don&rsquo;t), but being proud of how you&rsquo;ve risen from humble beginnings or a pile of ashes. We&rsquo;ve all been through the fire. And we will connect with you when you show us you&rsquo;re a real human being who understands his/her own story.</p><p> I once tried mightily (and failed) to convince a financial advisor to share his &ldquo;rags-to-riches&rdquo; tale. He had a poignant back-story on the streets of the Bronx but had yet to embrace the power of his financial rise from his working-poor family. The problem? He was convinced his wealthy clientele would look down on him. Even though most of them were entrepreneurs themselves who would completely identify with his journey.</p><p> His misplaced shame meant he couldn&rsquo;t see the power of his own story.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let that be you.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re ready to embrace your story, here&rsquo;s your assignment: finish your list of your pivotal career and life experiences. And then look for the threads that tie them together.</p><p> Ideally, do this with a partner. It&rsquo;s hard to be objective about your own life&mdash;but someone who cares for you will help you to see the unique beauty in your most heart-breaking and &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; (to you) experiences.</p><p> And then channel your essence&mdash;picking the most powerful, pivotal pieces&mdash;into your business story. Let it take 10 drafts or 20 if that&rsquo;s what it takes to truly own your hard-won fight to get right where you are right now.</p><p> Sharing your humanity will attract exactly the right clients to you.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In this article, we continue our discussion of BEI's Seven Step Exit Planning Process . We kicked off the series with a comparison of  Exit Planning and succession planning  and followed that with  setti ng the owner's goals  and the critical importance of  defining cash flow .</p><p> Today, we move to one of the functions of Step Three: building and protecting business value.</p><p> In the third step of The Seven Step Exit Planning Process, we make specific recommendations to build and protect the transferable value of a business. There are a host of value-building recommendations we can make - depending on the strengths and weaknesses of a particular business - many of which are fee opportunities for us. But, if we over look protecting the assets of a business from a successful legal attack, we have committed more than just a fundamental and avoidable Exit Planning failure. We may doom our clients' companies.</p><h3> A Few Assumptions <br/>  </h3><li> To engage in Exit Planning, owners must have a business to exit.</li><li> The better the business, the easier and more successful the exit.</li><li> Good businesses are not only profitable and well managed, but are proactive in minimizing operational and employment-related liabilities.</li><li> Uncorrected business liabilities limit or prevent a business sale.</li><p> With those in mind, let's look at a case study that illustrates five basic actions you can take to protect your owner-clients' assets.</p><li> Review the legal documents and business procedures related to employee relationships.</li><li> Separate business operations from the bulk of the business' assets.</li><li> Remove an owner's personal guarantees from business guarantees.</li><li> Review and revise the casualty and liability coverage.</li><li> Discuss personal asset protection tools.</li><h3> Reggie Requests a Risk Assessment <br/>  </h3><p> Reggie set up a meeting with me out of the blue - or so I thought - until he explained that his biggest competitor was now out of business after losing an employment discrimination lawsuit. \"What do I need to do to protect my business and my family? I am not about to lose everything I've worked for!\"</p><p> As is the case for most owners, Reggie's business comprised the bulk of his personal net worth. If he lost the business to a successful lawsuit, he'd lose most everything.</p><p> Reggie continued, \"Since I have a lot of business risk, I run a tight ship and operate my business as a corporation. I thought that gave me enough protection, but my competitor was a corporation as well. What's going on here?\"</p><p> I agreed that operating as a corporation provides a layer of personal protection but pointed out that 80 percent of Reggie's wealth was concentrated in his business. \"I don't know what your competitor did to protect his or her company, but I do know that we can do more to protect your company and your entire net worth from attack. Let's talk about protecting both personal and business assets.\"</p><p> In Reggie's case, an inventory of $5 million comprised the bulk of his company's net worth. Our goal was to insulate that asset from operational liabilities.</p><p> First, Reggie's attorney did what his biggest competitor should have done: brought all organizational documents up to date, created or reviewed employee handbooks, hiring and firing processes, employment agreements and qualified plan compliance documents.</p><p> Next his advisors separated the operation of Reggie's business from its assets. They severed operations - the part of the business likeliest to create liability exposure - from the bulk of the business's net worth (the inventory, cash, trade secrets, etc.). To accomplish this, they kept the exisiting corporate shell and formed a new, Limited Liability Company (LLC).</p><p> The operations of the company resided in the LLC because, as the name implies, a LLC generally limites liability for acts of the LLC to the assets of the LLC.</p><p> In putting operations in the LLC and leaving all other assets in the original corporation, if Reggie's company was attacked as a result of any of its operational activities, all of Reggie's other business assets would be sheltered. (Check with the tax and legal advisors on your advisor team to determine if this strategy is appropriate to your client's particular situation.)</p><p> Reggie's advisors then worked with Reggie and his creditors to remove his personal guarantees from every lease, promissory note, and financing agreement.</p><p> While Reggie's guarantee had been vital during his company's start-up years, it required no more than a phone call or meeting to persuade most of Reggie's lenders to replace Reggie's personal assets with the business assets. Reggie's insurance advisor initiated a comprehensive review of the company's business casulty and liability coverage. Not surprisingly, this review uncovered several under-insured and non-covered risk areas.</p><p> Finally, Reggie met with his estate planning attorney to consider insulating some of his personal assets from creditor attacks. To do so, the attorney reviewed Reggie's personal liability insurance policies and used a variety of tools including trusts and retitling of property.</p><p> As an Exit Planning advisor, you are in the best possible position to coordinate and implement comprehensive asset-protecting solutions for your owner/clients. No owner has all of the skills necessary to take all the asset-protecting actions described here and neither do their advisors - acting alone.The Seven Step Exit Planning Process gives you the platform, team and process needed to protect your clients and their companies.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cam_Hendricks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cameron Hendricks  </a> </u>  | <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Financial Symmetry  </u> </a></p><p> If we look like we could be your son or daughter, then you are likely on the right track to finding a financial advisor to form a relationship with.</p><h3> While we may look young, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we are inexperienced or harder to relate to. Let me explain:</h3><p> <br/> We entered the financial planning profession during the age of the rise of the comprehensive financial planner and we&rsquo;ve had the unique opportunity of learning from a team of high quality financial planners. Many firms over the last few years have emphasized the hiring and developing of young talent. Financial Symmetry is no different and has been hiring and promoting advisors from within throughout the 15 year history of the firm. Young advisors are developed through an increased level of responsibility as well as the chance to benefit from years of observing older advisors in the firm. We have seen what type of advisor we want to be and have determined what approach best fits our personality and goals. We therefore know what we want to communicate with our clients and how to do it.</p><p> Think about those you are associated with that you trust the most&hellip;likely friends and family top the list. You have built a relationship with these individuals over time and have trusted their recommendations whenever you seek their advice. I can attest that the FSI advisors strive for this type of relationship with their clients. We want to get to know you on a personal level as well as your family so we can best see and understand your financial goals.</p><p> It is also easier to relate to us than you may think. After all our parents are just a few years from retirement themselves. We have observed firsthand from them as well as their friends and co-workers what their needs and concerns involving retirement and overall financial planning include. We are accustomed to conversing and socializing with people older than us as well as our clients are accustomed to communicating and interacting with individuals of the younger generation such as their children.</p><p> There are some common differences you will find though, but I think they actually benefit us in a way that they won&rsquo;t for older advisors.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Technology:  </strong></h3><p> Yes, the amount of time we check our phones and social media sites may be unimaginable to you. However given this new technology age, knowledge and industry influencers are right at our finger tips. Every day we learn new and innovative ways to help us serve our clients better through reading of blogs, market commentary, and even sharing and learning ideas with other financial advisors. We are able to improve our processes utilizing the latest financial industry technology in order to better serve our clients.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Retirement:  </strong></h3><p> We aren&rsquo;t retiring soon&hellip;and that&rsquo;s a good thing! As a result of this when we engage in a relationship with a client, we intend it to be for the long haul. If you are closing in on your retirement and are working with an advisor who is in the same stage of life as you then &ldquo;guess what?&rdquo;&hellip;they are going to retire soon as well! The years prior to and immediately after retirement can be some of the most challenging years as you juggle financial decisions and you want to make sure you have a reliable advisor by your side throughout this process, not one that is thinking about their own retirement and may pass you off to a new advisor during this time of need.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Passion and Knowledgeable:  </strong></h3><p> No client wants to feel as if they are just a number, which can often happen when there is a lull in the advisor/client relationship. With a younger advisor we are &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; and &ldquo;passionate&rdquo; and helping our clients achieve their best financial life is our primary goal.</p><p>  When you combine this passion with knowledge this can be a dynamite combination that can truly be the defining mark of an advisor/client relationship. At Financial Symmetry all of our advisors have obtained the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER&trade; designation. As a result we have spent years in study, obtaining experience, and practicing in a fiduciary manner in order to engage in practices that are in the best interest of our clients.</p><p> As of 1/31/2016 there are a total of 73,852 CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERS&trade; with 2,682 of those residing in NC. Below is a chart showcasing how the 7 CFP&reg;s at Financial Symmetry compare to all CFP&reg;s from those who  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cfp.net/news-events/research-facts-figures/cfp-professional-demographics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have provided data to the CFP Board  </a> </u> :</p> MaleFemaleAges 20-29Ages 30-39Ages 40-49Ages 50-59Ages 60-69Ages 70-79All CFP&reg;s77%23%4%18%24%26%18%4%Financial Symmetry71%29%28%43%29%0%0%0%<p>  </p><p> The statistics that stand out to me is the relative younger age of all of Financial Symmetry&rsquo;s advisors compared to the majority of CFP&reg;s. This has positioned Financial Symmetry to serve our clients through a relationship that will last over a long period of time in order to provide a reliable and trustworthy advisor to guide them through the their financial affairs.</p><p> A statistic that also stands out to me is that less than 4% of all CFP&reg;s are under the age of 30.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-team/grace-kvantas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Grace Kvantas  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/our-team/cameron-hendricks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cameron Hendricks  </a> </u>  give Financial Symmetry two of their own.</p><p> The next generation of financial advisors are here and they are creating and strengthening relationships with clients throughout Raleigh and the surrounding Triangle area in order to best help them sort through their challenging financial affairs.</p>",

    "content": "<p> This profile is the first in an occasional series about individual baby boomers who either have retired or are facing the retirement decision.  </p><h3> Jane Kisielius is at that age &ndash; 63 &ndash; when she is being pushed and pulled between the work world and the retirement lifestyle that her husband already inhabits.</h3><br/>She retired once &ndash; temporarily &ndash; in August 2014 from a stressful job as head of the nursing team for the public schools in Quincy, a suburb southeast of Boston. But with her administrative and nursing skills in such demand, she was quickly sucked back into the labor market, this time as a part-time coordinator of a wellness program for Quincy residents. She was asked to help run the new, grant-funded education program after bumping into the commissioner of the Quincy Health Department.<p> &ldquo;The job fell in my lap,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was kind of hard to pass it up.&rdquo;</p><p> So here Jane sits, wrestling with when she&rsquo;ll really retire, as she drinks her morning coffee at the kitchen table in her orderly home, a stone&rsquo;s throw from the historic home of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams.</p><p> Her experience is very common. Thousands of baby boomers are retiring every day, and millions more, like Jane, are thinking hard about when they will do so.</p><p> As she ages, she increasingly finds herself weighing the inevitable frustrations of administration against the immense satisfaction she gets from working with people &ndash; her duties include teaching a class where residents learn to manage diseases like diabetes and advocate for themselves when seeking medical care. But a more leisurely life beckons.</p><p> As a working mother, she was constantly pushed and pulled between three growing children and part-time work, which would inevitably fall back into full-time employment. Now her husband is doing the tugging. John Kisielius, who retired in 2012, has what she calls a &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; travel bug &ndash; his latest travel idea revolved around a new direct flight from Boston to Portugal.</p><h3> Since his retirement, she&rsquo;s often felt &ldquo;we were going in two different directions.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> One thing is not a major factor in her decision: money. Although she was raised in a working-class Boston neighborhood, and her husband grew up poor, the couple is better off financially than most U.S. retirees. John was a lieutenant in the Boston Fire Department and has a full pension; Jane has a partial pension from the city of Quincy. They have paid off the house, own a summer house on Plum Island, and have dabbled in renovating and selling residential properties in a hot neighborhood near downtown Boston.</p><p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not millionaires, but we&rsquo;re so blessed,&rdquo; she said.</p><p> Many older workers today are  <u>  <a href=\"http://squaredawayblog.bc.edu/squared-away/fewer-boomers-get-social-security-at-62/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   putting off retirement  </a> </u>  either by choice or due to financial necessity. Unlike Jane, however, those who remain employed are more likely to work full-time than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2016/01/life-expectancy-gaps-promise-social-security/execsummary_chapter2_laterretirement_inequality_longevity.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   part-time  </a> </u> .</p><p> So, why hasn&rsquo;t Jane retired? She loves nursing and working. Her retirement in 2014 from the Quincy schools was triggered by a combination of things: age, long work days, and her husband&rsquo;s retirement.</p><p> Now back at work after that brief retirement, the push and pull resumes. So, Jane asks herself, will she retire for good in 2017 when the city&rsquo;s grant-funded program comes up for a review?</p>",

But for your client, it may be a small part of his or her world. They may have a crisis they are dealing with or a difficult boss they are trying to please. Relationships can be asymmetrical, especially in the beginning. Delays are often about THEM and their issues, not about the quality or acceptability of your proposed intervention.</p><p> <strong>  Third, apply a reasonableness test to your actions. </strong> How often would YOU like to be bugged about a proposal that a contractor or accountant submitted to you? You probably would want to make up your mind on your own time schedule, not theirs.</p><h3> Here are some specific suggestions: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. Ask for a meeting or call to discuss the proposal and get their reactions.</p><p> 2. Ask what the time frame is for their decision.</p><p> 3. Remind them once or twice after that.</p><p> 4. Ask what is on the critical path to make a decision. Do others have to be consulted further? Is it a competitive bid?</p><p> 5. Try and push your client one way or the other by saying something like this: \"Is this still an important priority for you? If so, why don&rsquo;t we get together to discuss how to move forward and address it. If not, let me know, and I&rsquo;ll be happy to re-engage with you in the future when it is more urgent for you.\"</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Scott D. Calhoun</p><h3> One major goal of a healthy financial advisor business is growth over time. Creating healthy growth often means building a larger group of professionals to bring in and handle the business.</h3><p> <br/> As the owner, after searching and evaluating good candidates, you bring in new advisors, train them, introduce them to your clients and encourage them to establish and build their own relationships. </p><p> Your objective is to allow your new advisors to develop so that they in turn will contribute to the long-term viability of your firm.</p><p> But what happens when one of those bright rising stars decides to take what she has learned from you, including your client list, and open up a competing advisor firm across the street?</p><p> You might think the answer is simple: have your advisors sign a non-compete agreement. You will then be completely protected, right? Unfortunately, the answer is often &ldquo;not really&rdquo;, &ldquo;probably not&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;actually, not at all.&rdquo;</p><h3> Inconsistent Laws from State to State <br/>  </h3><p> Non-compete agreements can be tricky, because this is an area of the law that has generated a variety of approaches in different states. Some states are generally pro-employer and permit these kinds of agreements on a fairly broad basis.  Others are much more restrictive. And some states, such as California, almost never allow these kinds of agreements.</p><p> Even where these agreements are permitted, they should be prepared by an attorney with detailed knowledge of the law of the particular state dealing with these issues.</p><h3> Getting Signatures? It&rsquo;s all in the Timing <br/>  </h3><p> Another important factor to consider is the timing of having your employees sign such an agreement. I have had clients in the past wait until the employee has left before coming to me to ask for help. Often, they are too late. These agreements stand the greatest chance of being enforceable when they are signed at the beginning of the employment relationship.</p><p> Some states limit the ability of employers to request that existing employees sign such an agreement in order to remain employed. You might have to pay special bonuses or promote the employee to provide sufficient &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; under the law.</p><h3> Protecting your &ldquo;Secret Sauce&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> As for your client lists and any proprietary formulas or processes, these are generally entitled to pretty strong protection as trade secrets &ndash; as long as you take the necessary steps to protect them. You need to make sure you get knowledgeable advice on this as well, because once information that was a trade secret is let out into the open, future protection is extremely difficult if not impossible.</p><h3> Ditch the Template for Maximum Protection <br/>  </h3><p> There are no simple answers here &ndash; no cookie cutter off-the-shelf templates that can simply be cut and pasted along with the employee&rsquo;s name. When litigated, courts evaluate these agreements based on all the facts and circumstances related to the employee and his or her relationship with your firm and the clients.</p><p> Proper drafting of such an agreement up front requires the same kind of evaluation of the facts and circumstances, including the territorial extent of the agreement, the types of activity to be restricted, and the scope of the employee&rsquo;s duties.  All of these need to be considered in light of the state&rsquo;s rules on what is necessary for such agreements to be reasonable and enforceable.</p><h3> The Bottom Line <br/>  </h3><p> As a business owner, you can and should take steps to protect your legitimate business interests. As with most things, doing so up-front on a pro-active basis is the most successful approach.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The world is brimming with individuals who want to be visionaries or thought-leaders. <br/>  </h3><p> Through the power of social media, content creation, and other digital means of permeation, that goal is unquestionably attainable.</p><p> It is not easy, however, and requires heaps of dedication, hard work, and critical thinking. The internet is a noisy place that grows exponentially louder day by day. Breaking through that barrier to get yourself and your ideas noticed is no small undertaking. So how do you ultimately get recognized?</p><p> By trusting the experts and following those who came before you. Fanatics Media CEO, Mark Fidelman, took to Blab.im on January 27 to consult with two of today&rsquo;s leading marketing strategy consultants, Dori Clark and Robbie Kellman Baxter. They helped shed some light on how entrepreneurs and business leaders can get their ideas noticed. Soak up all of their insights in the full version of this conversation below.</p><p> Dori Clark is a marketing strategy consultant, speaker, and author of the books &ldquo;Reinventing You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stand Out&rdquo; which was named the #1 leadership book of 2015 by Inc. Dori frequently contributes to Time, Harvard Business Review, Entrepreneur, and other publications and has been recognized as a branding expert by Fortune and Inc., one of Forbes &ldquo;25 Professional Networking Experts to Watch in 2015&rdquo;, and one of Huffington Post&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 Must Follow on Twitter&rdquo;.</p><p> Robbie Kellman Baxter is a keynote speaker, the President of Peninsula Strategies, and author of &ldquo;The Membership Economy&rdquo;. Armed with more than two decades of strategy consultation and marketing experience, Robbie has worked with major brands including eBay, Netflix, and Yahoo. Robbie&rsquo;s insights have been cited by eCommerce Times, the Wall Street Journal, and other large-scale publications.</p><p> Here are a few of the highly-useful insights these two had to share.</p><h3> Question #1: How Do You Become a Thought-Leader? <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Dorie: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;One of the most important things you can do in becoming a thought-leader is create a lot of content and share that with people.&rdquo;</p><p> All people really have are their ideas, and others will not be able to discover these concepts or determine if they have any merit unless they are shared. Going public with your views is a necessary step towards becoming a thought-leader. The main challenge that people encounter is time. Everyone is so busy that it is difficult to carve out the time to create a respectable amount of content without running themselves into the ground. As Mark was featured in Dorie&rsquo;s book, he poses as a prime example of how to accomplish this. Mark&rsquo;s strategy is to take a piece of content that has been produced and repurpose it in various ways. Create videos, tweets, eBooks, infographics, and really crunch the data surrounding the material to drill even deeper. Another strategy is to leverage existing affiliations in a strategic manner to help gain early credibility, social proof, and respectability.</p><p> <strong>  Robbie: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;You really want to think about, &lsquo;What am I using for discovery and what am I using to build relationships?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p> One of the main points to consider is a platform for discovery, which is how people find out about you who aren&rsquo;t already in the know. One way to establish this platform is through speaking at conferences and events. Be deliberate in your efforts and be proactive by reaching out and calling people to try and secure these opportunities. Another way to get a speaking gig is through connections who are already on the inside. These people can potentially be leveraged to bring attention to the fact that your speaking can be useful to others in the organization. In Robbie&rsquo;s case, however, she never just offers to speak but also extends the suggestion of a webinar as this helps to build interest in herself and the event overall. The most important tactic with these engagements is this:  &ldquo;Once you use these other platforms to build awareness, you want to bring them back to your own community.&rdquo;</p><h3> Question #2: How Do You Build a Big Community Around Your Brand? <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Robbie: </strong></p><p> The transaction of getting a member to join a community is the starting line, not the finish line. The more an experience can be curated and the more an individual can be taught how to get the most value from the community, the better the chances that person will help grow the number of members. People can be asked to share their personal stories, encourage others to join, and even be given status within the group. People want to be held in high regard so by asking individuals to take on a leadership role, it provides an incentive to help push that growth.</p><p> <strong>  Dorie: </strong></p><p> This is a three step process that is described in Dorie&rsquo;s book. The first step is to build your network. These people will be your trusted band of advisors who can help guide you. The second step is to build your audience through exposing people to your ideas who have yet to hear them. Step three is to build a community and encourage your audience to talk with each other by establishing a channel where people can connect around a shared interest. This can be a Google or Facebook group, a membership community, or similar outlets. Another component to this is to take the community offline and build in-person relationships. This will facilitate the connection of your community. It can managed through setting up local meetups, conferences, events, etc.</p><h3> Question #3: Building a Community Involves Getting People to Buy In to Your Story. How Do You Get Folks to be a Part of Your Success Story? <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Robbie: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much about getting them to buy into your story, it&rsquo;s about you tapping into their needs.&rdquo;</p><p> Storytelling is a highly useful tool; especially when it comes to educating people. As far as a community is concerned, the focus really needs to be on the mission of the members and using that mission as a guiding light for the stories. Be sure that the narratives that are crafted touch on your personal experiences in achieving that mission in addition to spotlighting member experiences. Bringing in the stories of community members is extremely relevant to their peers.</p><p> <strong>  Dorie: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Your story is the ultimate differentiator.&rdquo;</p><p> There is an abundance of leadership coaches, authors, and so forth and the only thing that sets an individual a part is their story and how it has impacted them. Dorie discussed a client of hers who grew up under adverse circumstances and didn&rsquo;t talk about it much. She encouraged him to share this part of his story which ultimately helped to shape his philosophy and approach.</p><p> This is just some of the industry-leading knowledge these two had to share. Check out the  <u>  full replay </u>  and really dig deep into the tactics that will get your ideas noticed.</p>",

    "link": "four-truths-about-the-millennial-generation-that-might-surprise-you",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/jen-diehl/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jen Diehl  </u> </a></p><p> If you&rsquo;re an RIA, you know the millennial generation is going to be a priority for the long-term success of your business. After all, according to CNNMoney, millennials already outnumber baby boomers &ndash; 87 million to 76 million, to be exact.</p><p> A nationwide debate has ensued as to whether millennials represent the greatest opportunity for RIAs, or if this hype is overblown. Either way, the fact remains this demographic will continue to infiltrate the world of financial services, and RIAs need to fully comprehend this generation&rsquo;s defining characteristics as well as their financial preferences and needs.</p><p> Before you dig too deep into the rabbit hole, be aware of these four truths about the millennial generation that might surprise you &ndash; or at least alter your thought process as you get your millennial marketing efforts in gear.</p><h3> 1. Targeting this generation should not be treated as a one-and-done deal <br/>  </h3><p> Treating the millennial generation as a collective group is a misguided notion. Millennials are at different stages of their financial lives &ndash; the generation as a whole spans over 16 years, ranging in age between 18 and 34, according to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/16/this-year-millennials-will-overtake-baby-boomers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pew Research Center.  </a> </u>  You cannot paint them all with the same brush.</p><p> While those on the younger end of the spectrum may be preoccupied with applying for college or their first credit card, others on the older end may be shopping for their first home or setting up 529 savings plans for their children.</p><p> When trying to reach millennials, start by catering your marketing efforts to the varying age groups. Younger millennials might be more accessible through social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, while older millennials may be more receptive to communications through LinkedIn or an email marketing campaign.</p><h3> 2. Millennials communicate in a variety of fashions <br/>  </h3><p> Despite the clich&eacute; that millennials are purely digital-centric beings, a significant number still favor communicating with colleagues in person. According to this study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bentley.edu/newsroom/latest-headlines/mind-of-millennial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bentley University  </a> </u> , 51 percent of millennials prefer to communicate face-to-face.</p><p> Millennials love communicating through digital platforms, but that&rsquo;s not to say RIAs should completely throw away their client-facing skill set. Advisers need to continually communicate with their younger clients through a blend of digital means and face-to-face meetings. Offering 24/7 online access to financial information as well as multiple avenues for your millennial clients to get in touch with you is a great place to start.</p><h3> 3. Talking with (not to) them will get you somewhere <br/>  </h3><p> As this blog and countless media outlets have previously reported, younger generations largely distrust the financial services industry. After watching their parents suffer through the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, this comes as no surprise.</p><p> Because of their hesitance to fork over their hard-earned savings to a financial services professional, attracting a younger clientele may be difficult for RIAs. Rather than speaking about millennials&rsquo; money troubles or the mistakes they are making, advisers must build trust and credibility with this generation.</p><p> The best way to do this is through a strategic media relations campaign. When targeting millennials, go after media placements in online publications like Business Insider, Vox and other new-age outlets with millennial-based audiences. Seeing your firm&rsquo;s name in the press not only spikes intrigue in your services, but also builds credibility and trustworthiness.</p><h3> 4. They actually understand the importance of saving money <br/>  </h3><p> Despite stereotypes that millennials overspend and are unfamiliar with money management techniques, they are actually surpassing boomers in savings.  <u>  <a href=\"http://corporate.troweprice.com/ccw/home/pressReleases/pressRelease.do?pressRelease=/html/content/home/pressReleases/pressReleaseContent/06222015.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   According to this T. Rowe Price study  </a> </u> , more millennials create financial budgets and stick to them.</p><p> When catering your RIA&rsquo;s marketing campaign to attract the millennial generation, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that this group&rsquo;s habits and preferences differ greatly from their predecessors&rsquo; when it comes to managing money. A large portion of this demographic is looking for more technology and a limited time investment. Your marketing campaign should reflect that.</p><p> Whether you like it or not, today marks only the beginning of millennials&rsquo; infiltration of the financial advice industry. But don&rsquo;t take a misguided approach to marketing and catering your services to the demographic. If you want to maximize your return on investment, take the time to truly learn about who they are and what they want.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The market has been on a wild ride lately, which has provided a wake-up call for investors who rode the six-year bull market &mdash; and its low volatility &mdash; without a care in the world. Now reality has set in. <br/>  </h3><p> As with all market corrections, this one has inspired retail investors to question whether it&rsquo;s time to pull money out, shift to safer and more stable investments or just throw in the towel entirely.</p><p> While it is normal to feel anxiety during a downturn, there&rsquo;s another way to look at it. As long as downturns and dips don&rsquo;t affect your financial plan or, more specifically, your immediate need for cash, they can be an opportunity.</p><p> Remember the mantra &ldquo;buy low and sell high&rdquo;? The volatility, geopolitical risk and uncertainty we&rsquo;ve experienced so far in 2016 have presented a particular opportunity for investors in the accumulation stage of their lives, or for anyone who has money but hasn&rsquo;t started investing yet, to actually buy low (or at least lower). If you&rsquo;ve been delaying investing regularly because the &ldquo;market was too high&rdquo; or &ldquo;you knew a correction was coming,&rdquo; now might be a good time to start.</p><p> The key is to view volatility &mdash; like what we experienced last August and what we are seeing now &mdash; as a tool to keep contributing regularly to your investments. This will let you maximize the possible potential for your investments and enable you to watch them grow.</p><p> The two best concepts to help you do that are dollar-cost averaging and compounded interest.</p><h3> Dollar-cost averaging <br/>  </h3><p> Dollar-cost averaging is the process of spreading out the costs of your investments as the market rises and falls, rather than purchasing shares all at one (potentially higher) price. The key is to pick a schedule &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s monthly, bimonthly or weekly &mdash; and an amount, no matter how small, and stick to it by purchasing as many additional shares in your investments as your fixed amount will allow. This is much more effective than trying to &ldquo;time&rdquo; the market by buying shares when they are at their lowest or selling when they are at their highest.</p><p> Using this system, you are regularly contributing the same amount, regardless of the price of shares. As a result, that fixed dollar amount buys more shares in times when the market has dropped and prices are low, and it limits the amount of shares when the market has risen and prices are high. Over time you will come out ahead, compared with trying to time the market.</p><h3> Compound interest <br/>  </h3><p> Once you have started to build up the size of your investment with the help of dollar-cost averaging, the concept of compound interest gives you a boost. Compounded interest is the interest you earn on the sum of both your initial investment and the interest that investment already has earned. If you have $1,000, for instance, and it earns 5% interest yearly, you will earn $50 at the end of the first year. Then, if you keep that money invested, the next year you will earn 5% interest on the total &mdash; $1,050 &mdash; which is $52.50. The following year, you will earn 5% on $1,102.50, which is a little more than $55.</p><p> Because dips in prices allow you to buy more shares with a fixed amount, volatility allows you to maximize the potential for compound interest as well.</p><p> Using these two concepts, the daily ups and downs and market corrections are not a cause for undue concern. If you are sticking to your dollar-cost averaging plan and taking advantage of compound interest, news events shouldn&rsquo;t affect your long-term plans and goals. Any dollar that is invested in the stock market should be a dollar that you are comfortable keeping invested through a bear market or a major correction.</p><p> If you are disciplined about investing, and consistent about reinvesting, you&rsquo;ll start to look at market volatility as a tool and an opportunity, rather than as a source of anxiety or, worse, a reason to throw in the towel and lose out on long-term growth.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The phrase &ldquo;the more, the merrier&rdquo; may ring true for a birthday party celebration, but not for B2B leads. <br/>  </h3><p> Having too many unqualified, incomplete or unrelated leads clutters your sales prospecting and wastes time. You don&rsquo;t want businesses knocking on your door with thousands of pointed questions, an air of skepticism and a trunkload of objections.</p><p> You want prospects that have heard great things about your company, read up on all the benefits of what you&rsquo;re offering and have cash in hand, eager to purchase.</p><p> Thankfully, a variety of proven strategies and the latest technology makes finding the latter easier than ever.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are seven quality B2B lead generation ideas </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Switch your strategy to inbound marketing with better blog content <br/>  </h3><p> As the Salesforce blog points out, 23 percent of total internet usage time is devoted to blog reading and social networking these days. Furthermore, outbound marketing methods like TV commercials, print ads, cold calling, email lists and banner ads cost 61 percent more, yet haul in less qualified B2B leads. While these methods still produce results, the majority of your focus should be on inbound marketing tactics like cultivating an in-depth blog that solves your constituents&rsquo; biggest problems. &ldquo;When prospects feel as though your company is an expert in the industry, or has something worthwhile to offer, they see you as someone who wants to help, rather than a salesman that just wants to make a sale,&rdquo; writes blogger Stuart Leung. This is especially true when you&rsquo;re dealing with other businesses who want to affiliate themselves with &ldquo;the best of the best.&rdquo;</p><p> <img alt=\"b2b lead generation infographic\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/b2b-lead-generation-content-marketing.gif\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.com/resources/infographics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Callboxinc.com  </a> </u></p><h3> 2. Score leads based on fit and interest <br/>  </h3><p> Lead scoring ranks a prospect&rsquo;s interest level and sales readiness based on a methodology that varies from company to company. Marketing Sherpa reports that &ldquo;On average, organizations that use lead scoring experience a 77 percent lift in lead generation ROI, over organizations that do not use lead scoring.&rdquo; However, they also found that 79 percent of marketers surveyed had not yet implemented lead scoring. If you&rsquo;re one of those companies, check out the 10 step approach offered by CRM Search to get started.</p><p> <img alt=\"B2B Lead Flow Success\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/b2b-lead-flow-success.png\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingcharts.com/traditional/content-strategies-not-optimized-for-high-quality-lead-generation-say-b2b-marketers-57388/attachment/cmocouncilnetline-top-factors-derailing-b2b-lead-flow-success-july2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MarketingCharts.com  </a> </u></p><h3> 3. Get on the lead nurturing train <br/>  </h3><p> Effective B2B lead generation isn&rsquo;t just about that first point of contact. If you&rsquo;re not already on the lead nurturing train, it&rsquo;s time to get aboard. Marketo points out that companies who are excellent at lead nurturing are able to generate 50 percent more sales at a 33 percent lower cost than other competitors with less effective systems in place. The company&rsquo;s lead nurturing software makes it easy to build relationships with B2B prospects through email, advertising and mobile engagement. You&rsquo;ll be able to track analytics data regarding prospect behavior and score leads by not only demographics, but also by recent actions taken online and periods of inactivity to know the best times for intervention to deliver more information or clinch that sale.</p><p> <img alt=\"B2B Content Marketing Goals\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/b2b-content-marketing-goals.jpg\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/01/small-business-content-marketing-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Contentmarketinginstitute.com  </a> </u></p><h3> 4. Assess your lead capture forms with A/B testing <br/>  </h3><p> A/B testing is not just for landing pages or ads. Your business to business lead generation form could be part of the issue as well. The Optimizely Blog tells the story of Iron Mountain, a B2B software and management company, that was able to increase lead quality by 140 percent by running an A/B test on their lead capture form. Issues identified included: accuracy (lots of false phone numbers or emails listed through the &ldquo;contact us today&rdquo; form), improper intent (lots of leads were actually people looking for support or inquiring about job opportunities), and incompleteness (many fields were missing). Test variations included changing &ldquo;contact us today&rdquo; to &ldquo;request a quote&rdquo; and adding validation functionality to each field so incomplete forms or incorrect data could not make it through the pipeline. The tests confirmed their hypotheses and resulted in much higher quality leads.</p><h3> 5. Use email drip campaigns to promote your content <br/>  </h3><p> A common mistake many marketers make is believing that content is like &ldquo;the field of dreams&rdquo; &mdash; where &ldquo;if you build it, they will come,&rdquo; says B2B marketing expert Mike Templeman. Instead, each piece of content needs to be actively promoted through as many channels as you can &mdash; &ldquo;social media, native ads, display, SEO, syndication,&rdquo; to name a few of Mike&rsquo;s specific recommendations. Once you get a fish on your hook, you need to reach out and touch that person at least a dozen times through an email drip campaign. Deliver whitepapers, eBooks, guides, surveys, coupons, infographics, videos and blog posts to each B2B prospect&rsquo;s inbox &mdash; personalized and appropriately timed, as to not bombard the recipient, of course. We like to use software by aWeber for creating and scheduling regular email newsletters. For a list of tools for initiating email drip campaigns, see Zapier&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://zapier.com/learn/ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing-apps/best-drip-email-marketing-apps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   25 Best Email Marketing Apps to Send Drip Campaigns.  </a> </u></p><h3> 6. Use LinkedIn&rsquo;s Sales Navigator tool <br/>  </h3><p> As we&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past, LinkedIn is still the top dog in online lead generation among B2B companies. They know this all too well and have developed tools to help you get the most out of your experience on the networking site. LinkedIn Sales Navigator uses a sophisticated algorithm to deliver lead recommendations tailored to you. From there, you can easily save and follow up on the suggested leads. You&rsquo;ll be able to access profiles outside your network, see who has viewed your profile, and receive real-time sales updates to help you time your correspondence just right. After the free trial expires, the tool costs $79.99/month or $779.88/year. Another option if you&rsquo;re looking to get more bang for your buck is to work with a marketing company like Mod Girl Marketing, which has already paid for access to these tools and learned the system. That way, you reap all the benefits without the learning curve or another monthly expense to track.</p><p> <img alt=\"Linkedin Sales Navigator\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/linkedin-sales-navigator.png\"/></p><p> Image Source:  <u>  <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/products/sales-navigator\" target=\"_blank\">   LinkedIn  </a> </u></p><h3> 7. Add a customer referral program to your list of B2B lead generation strategies <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s nothing better than getting a sales lead from a happy customer. Referrals are often the most qualified leads you can get because individuals tend to know a great deal about the needs and personalities of their friends, which saves you a lot of leg work and research. A 2015 study conducted by Capterra found that 76 percent of software buyers have asked as friend or colleague for recommendations before buying. &ldquo;This likely could be applied to other B2B products,&rdquo; they conceded.</p><p> Drive referral-based leads by:</p><li> Making it easy with referral software.</li><li> Providing clear, visual instructions on how your referral program works. (We like infographics for this!)</li><li> Creating a landing page to promote your referral program. (See the below example from Elance.)</li><li> Giving away cash, gift cards or services as part of the promotion.</li><li> Asking for referrals at the end of a sale. (&ldquo;Do you know anyone else who might be interested?&rdquo;)</li><li> Partnering with complementary businesses to tap a new pool of customers and share the love.</li>",

    "content": "<h3> You may be surprised to learn a few things about St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</h3>To start, St. Patrick wasn&rsquo;t even Irish, he was from Britain.  Second, shamrocks don&rsquo;t really exist, they&rsquo;re mythical plants.  Finally, St. Patty is short for St. Patricia &ndash; St. Paddy is the more correct abbreviation for the holiday.  For many of you, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is not the only green-themed event on your mind this week as the biggest money event of the year is fast approaching &ndash; the income tax filing deadline, April 15th. Although not nearly as fun as Irish trivia, we thought we would also share some important facts about taxes that may surprise you.State Surprise! You may have been surprised to receive a 1099 from your state&rsquo;s franchise tax board. This is because any amount of state income tax refunded to you is subject to federal tax in the following year. You are hearing this correctly &ndash; your state income tax refund is taxable at the federal level. In all fairness, you did receive a federal deduction for state taxes paid the prior year, so it could be a wash but, the 1099 may still come as a shock.  If you are receiving large state refunds, consider adjusting your withholdings to avoid a short-term loan to the government.<h3> Mortgage Myth.</h3>Despite popular belief, not all mortgage interest is deductible. Interest is only deductible on the first $1M of borrowed funds used to buy, build or improve a home. So, if you purchase a home for more than $1.25M and put 20% down, you will not be able to deduct all of your interest payments. Additionally, interest paid on an equity line used for purposes other than to buy, build or improve your home, is only deductible on the first $100K.Underpay and Pay. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the IRS wants your money, and they want it now (or at least on time). If you do not withhold enough in taxes throughout the year, you could be subject to an <a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/click/edllbb/uhfwk3/y4vbju\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  underpayment penalty </u>  </a>when you file. For most people, payroll withholdings facilitated by an employer will be sufficient. For the self-employed, retirees who are not collecting a paycheck, or workers with other substantial sources of income, however, the responsibility is on them to make timely <u> <a href=\"https://fairmark.com/general-taxation/estimated-tax/making-estimated-tax-payments/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  estimated tax payments </a></u>.<h3> Add More Tax.</h3>An easy way to remember what &ldquo;AMT&rdquo; (Alternative Minimum Tax) means, think: add more tax. Simply put, AMT is an alternative &ldquo;equation&rdquo; to calculate your income tax liability. If this second way of doing math ends in a larger tax liability, then you will pay more.Oh, and in case you missed it Monday, happy<u> <a href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/click/edllbb/uhfwk3/upxbju\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  National Pi Day </a></u>.

This applies to both our personal and professional lives. Whether you are a leader or a follower; a client or a supplier; a neighbor; or an acquaintance, on an unconscious level you are continually trying to determine whether another individual is a friend or a foe. When we trust, we feel that it is reasonable to expect kindness and concern from others and that they will look out for our best interest. When we distrust, we expect that they will act with cruel intentions and in their own best interest. When we trust, we feel safe. When we distrust, we feel the need to protect ourselves. So, what is the ultimate determination of trust? One simple question: are they friend or foe?</p><h3> <strong>  Inclusion or exclusion </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s human nature to fear being excluded. We have succeeded as a civilization by banding together. In the times of our ancient ancestors, individuals who were shunned and left on their own would have been unable to thrive. Things have not changed as much as we sometimes think they have. We still rely on teaming together with other individuals with a common purpose. With friends, we always have a sense of inclusion and working together toward shared goals. With a foe, we often feel we are being excluded and left on our own. When we feel included, we start developing trust.</p><h3> <strong>  Safe or fearful </strong></h3><p> <br/> We all want to feel safe. Immediately upon meeting someone we unconsciously start to make judgments about if we feel safe, or if we feel threatened. Friends make us feel safe. We know we can be ourselves; we can share our thoughts and ideas. Foes make us feel fearful. We feel the need to protect ourselves; we keep our thoughts and ideas to ourselves out of fear of judgment and ridicule. When we feel safe, we start to trust.</p><h3> <strong>  Honest or deceitful </strong></h3><p> <br/> Friends are transparent. They are open and honest. You know what to expect from a friend and are never blindsided by dishonest motives. Friends share your goals and vision of success and the future. Friends handle disagreements fairly. Foes are deceitful. They twist the facts to meet the needs of their own agenda; an agenda that is self-serving. They are manipulative and resort to trickery and bullying when conflict arises. When others are honest, we feel we can trust them.</p><h3> <strong>  Authentic of fake </strong></h3><p> <br/> Friends are authentic. The friend you got yesterday is the same friend you get today and, the same friend you will get tomorrow. Friends respect you, they are always there for you, they are good listeners, and genuinely care about your well-being. You can count on friends to do what they say they are going to do. With a foe, you never know what to expect; they are fake and disrespectful. You can&rsquo;t count on them, they listen only to respond, and they are only concerned with how they can benefit from the situation. When people are authentic, we feel good about trusting them.</p><h3> Friend of Foe?</h3><p> <br/> Are we included or excluded? Do we feel safe or fearful? Are they honest or deceitful? Are they authentic or fake? Subconsciously we are always evaluating the behaviors of others to determine if they are friend or foe. If the answer is friend, we trust. If the answer is foe, we distrust. In turn, others are looking at our behavior to signal whether we are friend or foe. Learn to embrace the behaviors and develop the friendships that allow for trusting personal and professional relationships.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Did you know 54% of marketers rate email as the most effective type of digital marketing and the least difficult to execute? <br/>  </h3><p> Email marketing provides Financial Advisors an effective way to stay in touch with current clients and prospects.</p><p> Here are six ways to optimize your email marketing for better success in the future:</p><h3> 1) Personalize Your Emails <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s 2016. Consumers want to have a conversation with a business rather than be sold to. The first step to take is to make sure that you are not sending your emails from a no-reply@thisdoesntwork.com.</p><p> Personalize your emails to each recipient. The most effective way to do this is to include their name in the first sentence of your email copy.</p><p> So you&rsquo;ve personalized your email, what&rsquo;s next?</p><h3> 2) Use a Call-To-Action (CTA) <br/>  </h3><p> About 89% of marketers say that email is their primary channel for lead generation. You&rsquo;ve grabbed your reader&rsquo;s attention, but how do you convert them into a client? Use a CTA.</p><p> A CTA is a button or link that you place on your website, or in this case email, to drive prospective customers to become leads. Now, what makes a good CTA? Visually, the button should large enough to see and placed in an easily visible spot. Make sure that your message is clear, direct and motivating. Some great CTA examples include:</p><img alt=\"CTA Example using Humboldt County website\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/humboldt-country-cta.png\"/><img alt=\"CTA Example using Huemor website\" height=\"523\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/huemor-cta.png\" width=\"699\"/><h3>  </h3><h3> 3) Is your email visually appealing? <br/>  </h3><p> About 81% of people skim content online rather then read it word for word. Don&rsquo;t overburden your emails with too much text. The results will be disappointing. As an Advisor, you should try to visually communicate information to prospects. Considering that the average person gets distracted in eight seconds, you want to ensure that your emails are concise, visually appealing and make information retention easy. Simplicity is key.</p><p> PayPal does a great job at simplifying their emails (see below). Their content is delivered in a clever and concise way, while communicating how their product can benefit the reader.  This email is simple, direct and very easy to follow.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Paypal.png\" width=\"336\"/></p><h3> 4) Have a compelling subject line <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t over-think this! The more direct your subject line, the better. Using phrases that come off as a sales pitch will make your email recipients feel that you are trying to trick them. So, avoid phrases like &ldquo;The best decision you&rsquo;ll make today.&rdquo;</p><p> According to HubSpot, over one-third emails are opened based on the sub   ject line alone. You want to create a subject line that instills curiosity or provides value to your recipient. As an Advisor, what works for someone in social media may not necessarily work for you. Over time, get a feel for what your recipients respond to best and stick with it.</p><h3> 5) Advertise your online presence <br/>  </h3><p> Optimize your email by providing links to your social media accounts and your website. In other words, provide your readers with the option to visit your Twitter, Facebook, or any other social media platform you use as well as your website to advertise your business. By doing this, you should notice an increase in views, likes and followers on the platforms that you advertise. As an Advisor, this could also aid in converting your leads into clients!  Email is the dominant form of business communication and when used wisely, can greatly increase your client base. Shown below is a great way to visually advertise your links.</p><h3> 6) Are you mobile-optimized? <br/>  </h3><p> Millennials are the age group most likely to check their email from bed (70%), from the bathroom (57%), or while driving (27%). As a Financial Advisor, this generation of consumers is very important to the future success of your business. To secure your millennial leads, you want to ensure that you are not only able to reach them, but to convert them into clients as well. According to emailmonday, 67.2% of consumers use a smartphone to check their email. To successfully grab their attention, you want to engage them on all platforms &ndash; especially mobile.</p><p> Email marketing is still considered one of the most effective types of digital marketing. As a Financial Advisor, you want to utilize this form of digital marketing to effectively stay in touch with current clients and prospects.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> It has been so long since I have encountered a classic good ole boy advisor that I was stunned into silence. <br/>  </h3><p> I was introduced to Tom at a holiday party and learning he was a financial advisor, I looked forward to engaging in an interesting conversation. But after just five minutes I was planning my escape, which couldn&rsquo;t come fast enough.</p><p> It was almost painful listening to him boast about his 1,300 clients and all of the industry deals in which he helped play a role. He practically shared his complete resume, telling me how great he was and how he would never retire. Was I really supposed to be impressed by all of this, because I most definitely was not. In my mind it was like being transported back to the cave man days of martini bars, short skirts, and hot stocks.</p><p> There was no back and forth to our conversation. It was a one-way trip to Egoville with no room for authenticity or sharing of idea. Each time there was a short break (as he gasped to fill his lungs for the next round of automatic bragging) I tried to show interest, stroking his ego a bit, which only encouraged his tirade about a time when he was King. I noticed his girlfriend who was obviously bored hearing the same old stories, but still listening obediently. Ughhh.   </p><p> When I did finally get a word in I expressed how I help advisors build stronger relationships with women. With no surprise his automatic response was, &ldquo;I do great with women.&rdquo; In my mind I shook my head, as this had to be the farthest thing from the truth. When my husband and I finally did leave the party I couldn&rsquo;t wait to jump in the car and spew my disgusts to him about this person and his self-centered dialogue.</p><h3> So why did this one conversation take up so much space in my head? <br/>  </h3><p> I mulled over it over for days until I realized the real lesson to be learned, the fact that I was shocked by this behavior was significant.</p><p> Fifteen to 20 years ago this kind of conversation would have been status quo but not now; that&rsquo;s why this advisor stuck out like a sore thumb. Granted, there are still some good ole boys out there (I could name a few), but most have learned to wait until the door is closed before they start patting themselves on the back.  </p><p> I began to reflect on the hundreds of fabulous male advisors I have coached and trained&mdash; male advisors who want to improve the lives of others while still bringing home the bacon to support their families.   <br/> <br/> Advisors who want to create a better environment for women, where women are encouraged to become more engaged in their finances.   <br/> <br/> Advisors who want to transform the reputation of the industry from the wolfish image to one of value and professionalism.   <br/> <br/> As I continued to reflect on the hundreds of wonderful men who are committed to building a practice that is highly ethical, I realized that in many ways we really have come a long way. It&rsquo;s so easy to focus on the few who make our business tainted and corrupt, instead of focusing on the many who truly care about changing and improving the lives of others. The fact that I was shocked was definitely significant.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;Nobody wants to hear how rough the water is, just get in the boat and start rowing.&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> At least that&rsquo;s what my little league coach used to tell us kids. It&rsquo;s also one of my favorite leadership quotes. We were the original Bad News Bears, but we ended up in first place anyway. </p><p> Since then I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be part of many, many more outstanding teams and organizations. </p><p> They&rsquo;ve all had these four characteristics in common, including my Bad News Bears experience:</p><h3> 1) Great Leadership Qualities <br/>  </h3><p> Certainly, winning organizations require exceptional leadership. Great leaders are humble at their core and are willing to do any job, no matter how small, to achieve the objective.</p><p> They&rsquo;re passionate about what they do and this permeates the organization.</p><p> Their integrity is beyond reproach; they put the unit ahead of themselves, they&rsquo;re kind, empathetic, but can be stern when warranted.  They demand excellence and they set the standard for work ethic and live the team&rsquo;s morals and values.</p><p> Very few teams win with poor leadership.  Gifted talent alone rarely suffices.</p><p> Want to lead a winning team?  Look in the mirror, it begins and ends with you.</p><h3> 2) Egos are championship killers <br/>  </h3><p> Quick name a sports team that has drafted or traded for an egocentric player and gone on to win a championship.  I can&rsquo;t think of one off-hand.</p><p> There&rsquo;s really no room in any organization for a self-centered egotist.  They&rsquo;re divisive at their core and by definition it&rsquo;s all about them and not the rest of the crew. </p><p> However, there are plenty of examples where divas have destroyed team chemistry.</p><p> Championship teams&rsquo; players leave their egos at the door.  Their members spread the accolades and shoulder the blame when things go wrong.</p><p> Want to be a great teammate?  Do your best, keep your head down, encourage your teammates and check your ego at the door.   </p><p> If you must complain, do so to your spouse, friends or family, but don&rsquo;t burden your cohorts with your hurt feelings or bruised ego. </p><p> My old coach was right.  Nobody wants to hear how rough the water is, they just want to us to get in the boat and start rowing.</p><h3> 3) No Old Guy vs. New Guy Mentality <br/>  </h3><p> Hazing rituals are bad. Period. They shame, humiliate and dehumanize. Who wants to be part of an organization that the price of admission is shame? </p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there&rsquo;s always going to be good-natured ribbing of the newbies. And, sometimes rookies might even have to pick up some humbling duties. </p><p> But, there&rsquo;s a difference. Humbling good. Shaming bad. </p><p> If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, then it makes sense to strengthen all the links.</p><p> The best teams take the new guys, put their arms around them and bring them up to standard through guidance, drill, and instruction. </p><p> Duke Men&rsquo;s Basketball Coach Krzyzewski discusses this very thing in his book, Leading With The Heart.  Each year he has to welcome a new group of freshmen to the team.  On day one he tells them the standards and pairs them with a senior.  </p><p> They set the example. </p><p> Furthermore, Coach K welcomes new guys into something much bigger than a basketball team; he welcomes new guys into a family. </p><p> Powerful stuff.</p><h3> 4) Honest and Open Feedback <br/>  </h3><p> Finally, honest and open feedback is the norm in highly functional squads.</p><p> My daughter is on an outrigger canoe paddling team.  It&rsquo;s an amazing team sport for this one simple reason; everybody gives 100% the entire race. </p><p> There&rsquo;s no slacking. </p><p> The individual in front sets the pace and each person behind can see and feel the effort of the person in front of them.   The person in the back paddles and steers.  If the canoe goes crooked, everyone sees it. </p><p> There&rsquo;s no place to hide. Slack off and you&rsquo;ll be called out. </p><p> Units where members can&rsquo;t speak up, where poor performance is allowed and accepted and where individuals hide in the shadows are dysfunctional, and regardless of the talent, will rarely if ever be &ldquo;championship&rdquo; teams.</p><p> First-place unit members pursue timely, consistent, honest and open feedback among each other.  It&rsquo;s healthy and everyone knows it will ultimately make the team better.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> From little league teams and beyond, awesome units share these four common characteristics,</p><p> 1. Great leadership</p><p> 2. Lack of ego</p><p> 3. No old guy vs. new guy mentality</p><p> 4. Honest and Open Feedback</p><p> Exceptional leaders know this and understand they are responsible for setting the conditions for characteristics 2, 3 and 4 above. Just get in the boat and start rowing.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;ve written about my exhaustion lately. Whenever I get that way, I search my own blog and  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/category/todays-line/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Today&rsquo;s Line to Live By  </a> </u>  stack for help. It sounds ridiculous, but even I need reinforcement and reconditioning&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not afraid to ask myself for advice.</p><p> One daily exercise I&rsquo;ve practiced religiously is visualization. I&rsquo;ve slipped away from it lately, but I&rsquo;m back on track. I thought I&rsquo;d discuss it in this post. Five minutes of this every day will improve your life dramatically.</p><h3> When did that gray hair and eye wrinkle show up? <br/>  </h3><p> Much like you, I look in the mirror every day. I snap a selfie or 10 with my wife and dogs.</p><p> I never notice my face change from day to day. Only when I look at pictures from a few years back can I see the transformation.</p><p> Much of your life is like this. Your career is like this. Your marriage can be like this.</p><p> While most people prefer to slow the aging process, many want to accelerate their lives and careers. Much like the unnoticeable change with age, your progress from day to day becomes imperceptible.</p><p> Oftentimes, you&rsquo;ll feel better about your advancements if you take time to look back at where you were one, three, and five years ago. That&rsquo;ll help your psyche a bit (in most cases).</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure many of you are like me. You feel where you&rsquo;ve been is history. You care more about getting where you&rsquo;re going&mdash;and you want to get there is a hurry!</p><h3> I&rsquo;m running really fast but I can&rsquo;t see the finish line? <br/>  </h3><p> There are few key principles to understand to help you quickly get from point A to point B.</p><p> The first is you&rsquo;ll get where you&rsquo;re going faster if you know where you want to go. It also helps to know where you are. Don&rsquo;t laugh. Most people are in a much better starting position than they realize.</p><p> The second is you&rsquo;ll make greater leaps in life by doing small things you love than doing big things you don&rsquo;t. You need to enjoy yourself each day because your passion and optimism will fuel getting things done.</p><p> The third is you need to believe you can get there and be unafraid to jump in! At least once a day, I think about this fantastic quote from American Naturalist and Essayist John Burroughs. He said, &ldquo;Leap, and the net will appear.&rdquo;</p><h3> Where&rsquo;s the 5-minute thing you promised me? I&rsquo;m in a hurry&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Okay antsy pants. Visualize yourself at your end-state even though you don&rsquo;t know how to get there.</p><p> Imagine yourself at your &ldquo;destination.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s it like? How does it feel? How does it sound? What will this end-state allow you to do?</p><p> Imagine this for five minutes. It&rsquo;s okay to dream, but you&rsquo;re more likely creating a reality.</p><p> &ldquo;Five minutes&rdquo; means you can do this in the shower, on the train, or wherever. It&rsquo;s best to do it in a quiet location.</p><p> This visual of you in all your glory will have pull power&mdash;it&rsquo;ll feel like it&rsquo;s pulling you toward it. In actuality, you&rsquo;ll be pushing yourself toward it one step at a time.</p><p> There are really only two steps required for the greatest level of success: the next step and the extra step. You simply need to know what you need to do next to move toward your destination. Putting a little extra effort along the way will separate you from the masses who are unwilling to do that.</p><h3> I wish I new what Reality TV was when I started&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Here&rsquo;s how I visualize.</p><p> Twelve years ago, I changed professions. I left a corporate position as an Information Technology and Management Consultant to become a professional recruiter. I shared some of this in  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/the-secret-to-avoid-career-stagnation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Secret to Avoid Career Stagnation  </a> </u> .</p><p> At the time, I knew I loved helping people. I felt then (and still do) my purpose was to become a premier source of help for people who want to improve their careers and lives.</p><p> I knew when I started that I could help many by working with them to secure new career opportunities. I&rsquo;d also provide guidance to others who I couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;place&rdquo; in new jobs. This combination of people numbered in the several hundreds in my first year in business. Good start!</p><p> At this point, I started visualizing myself helping tens of thousands. I imagined it even though I didn&rsquo;t know how. More phone calls wasn&rsquo;t the answer because there simply wasn&rsquo;t enough time.</p><p> As I continued to visualize over the years, the number of people I&rsquo;d help kept growing. I wanted to help hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of people.</p><p> I started to envision ways to communicate with them&mdash;blogging, writing books, and speaking. Then I just started doing those things, even if I wasn&rsquo;t proficient yet.</p><h3> Before I knew what hit me, I was on the radio and TV. How did that happen? <br/>  </h3><p> I began visualizing speaking to larger audiences. I would need to reach these people more easily. Better yet, can I figure out how to get them to find me? What&rsquo;s this social media stuff? What are Search Engine Optimization, Webinars, and these other mediums?</p><p> As you witness the transformation, your visualizations become more real. The picture becomes clearer.</p><p> You believe it. Then it happens. It&rsquo;s never the other way around.</p>",

    "link": "coffee-and-the-fintech-bubble",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I get a lot of &ldquo;My name is John Smith and I am as of now interested in FinTech and available on Monday at 1:50pm around Monument, I will buy you a coffee to hear your opinions as your name keeps coming up&rdquo; demands on Twitter.Needless to say this thrills me as I love coffee. Also because I&rsquo;m independently wealthy and do not need to worry about selling my time and knowledge as a consultant. (This, for those of us who sometimes miss it in my articles, is sarcasm.)There is an acute devaluation happening in FinTech. Of knowledge, of time and of actual sums of money.There is no point wondering why there are no &ldquo;became rich through FinTech&rdquo; stories as we may attribute that to it not having yet reached its potential, neither is there any point discussing the plight of trying to sell knowledge in a market intent on maintaining mediocre standards of know-how that accommodate the status quo.But it&rsquo;s worth looking at the bigger numbers thrown around in the industry to see if those at least reward value. It seems the numbers simply don&rsquo;t make sense here either. Part of it is normal dilution as the space is becoming overcrowded but part of it is baffling.I don&rsquo;t begrudge the superstar fund raisers their 10th round or their undeserved billion dollar evaluation as it&rsquo;s not all about whether eTorro is better than the host of other propositions in its space. Or if SoFi is the exact same one as tens of other attempts in the US P2P market albeit with a more defined segment, it&rsquo;s about who was in front of investors when they agreed to it. Same goes for why a new challenger bank would raise tens of million on a hope and a dream while a comparable proposition would have raised a quarter of that in their entire existence.That may not be intuitively fair but it&rsquo;s normal. Technology has never been about the pure product or solution but about what it is that transforms it from a scientific endeavor to a business proposition &ndash; the people behind it.With that said, there has to be an intersection point where value of people&rsquo;s salemanship can not cover lack of tangible technology, right? There is no way we, the industry, would finance absolutely non-existent preposterous propositions yet let valuable tech fall by the side of our golden bricks pathway, right? We may get confused by the lack of established vernacular and intentional consultancy speak making everything sound equally shinny and impressive and we may fall in love with some of their people but surely in our hearts of hearts we know enough collectively that the overall result will be one of the wheat separating itself from the chaff, right? Wrong. <img alt=\"12065269_2a8c_1024x2000\" src=\"https://cdnstatic.duenablomstrom.com/dblomstromcontent/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12065269_2a8c_1024x2000.jpg \"/> In the past two to three years it&rsquo;s almost like we&rsquo;ve become inundated with both people and proposals that are of very limited quality and yet we&rsquo;ve also gotten less and less willing to be vocal about it.If knowledge is the emperor, the emperor is slowly shedding his clothes in our industry and we&rsquo;re going to stand by and watch it become butt naked and not even point and snigger.We make wider and wider of bets. We&rsquo;re less and less inclined to ever call a spade a spade and we found a way to believe this bubbling format of hundreds of incubators and accelerators, 30 challenger banks in one country only and growing YoY in people and solutions at a astounding rate is normal.We are even so far removed from common sense that we can wonder IF this is a bubble.We compare ourselves with Tech in general, they are booming, in a healthy manner right? Why not FinTech, then? Because &ldquo;Tech&rdquo; is the underbelly of everything. Every aspect of our lives. FinTech is an overgrown mushroom of one thing only: the way money providers sort out their backend and their frontend to answer consumer needs.Think about it &ndash; ours is a gazillion-billion industry which we believe will forever continue to thrive built solely around the fact that banks and others were unable to get their act straight on their own. Same goes for insurance hence the now emerging &ldquo;InsureTech&rdquo;. Where is RetailTech though? Or AutoTech?One would argue it&rsquo;s not only fixing but looking ahead and innovating and disrupting hence the space for the flock of savior-unicorns but why are we so accepting of the premise that innovation was only their apanage and non-accessible to the incumbents? Because they are big monolithic organizations paralyzed by a culture of fear to move which is why they need FinTech. Circular, isn&rsquo;t it?Most of us have accepted that a period of serious maturing and consolidation has to happen in FinTech fast and in a few years it will hopefully, mercifully even disappear as a term and be just &ldquo;Tech&rdquo; once again (with its wonderful Augmented Reality, Design DNA, Data and AI focus as the visionary of us &ndash; Brett King for instance have noticed). It will mean we finally got our collective house in order and are able to give people access and overview of their MoneyMoments in a simple, enjoyable way that flows into their lives.I believe we are no further than three, maybe five years away before this whole industry built on how culture prevented banks from fulfilling their purpose would have finally deflated and shrunk to a maybe a quarter of its size today so I would say taking a sudden interest in having FinTech coffees with me may be a poor career choice at this time, John.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acting4sales\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Julie Hanson  </u> </a> | <u>  Performance Sales and Training </u></p><p> Imagine having just 18 minutes to deliver your sales presentation. Could you make your key point, engage your prospect, and motivate him to take action?</p><p> Thousands of TED speakers attempt to do just that with audiences each year &mdash; many with fantastic levels of success. Ted Talks are viewed about 1.5 million times a day and, fair or not, they have raised the bar on what your audience expects from a sales presentation.</p><h3> <strong>  How do you stack up to TED? </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Odds are your prospect watches TED Talks, as do your competitors. So it&rsquo;s important to know how your presentation stacks up to the comparison. Here are some important questions to ask yourself and tips you should consider applying to your presentation to stand out with today&rsquo;s savvy audiences:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Do you stick to one big idea? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you have a fairly complex solution, sticking to one idea probably sounds near impossible. Yet TED Talks take on some pretty complex topics (Poverty, robots, disease) all within 18 minutes or less. Instead of a hailstorm of information which complex topic might warrant, good TED speakers maintain focus by organizing their content around one main idea that ties it all together and makes it easier for the audience to remember. Read more about how to highlight your One Big Idea here.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Do you hook with your opening? </strong></h3><p> <br/> TED presenters know they have to grab their audience with a powerful opening, and a hook is the way to do that. A hook is an attention-grabbing device that relates to or introduces the topic. Whether it&rsquo;s a story, a quote, or an insight, statistic, or question, the hook starts the presentation off on a strong and relevant note. (BTW, your company overview is NOT a hook.)</p><h3> <strong>  3. Do you use a catchphrase? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Successful TED Talks often repeat a phrase that quickly summarizes their idea to help the audience remember it. Think of &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it,&rdquo; from Simon Sinek&rsquo;s popular Ted Talk, or &ldquo;Decision is the ultimate power,&rdquo; from Tony Robbins. Incorporating a catchy phrase that encapsulates your key point or differentiator, like &ldquo;a small change can make a big impact&rdquo; will serve to anchor your presentation in a prospect&rsquo;s mind.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Are you telling a story? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The most popular TED Talks open with a personal story. Storytelling is an extremely effective technique for increasing the emotional engagement of your audience. Relatively underused (or poorly used) in sales presentations, storytelling scores high on the attention meter when done well and quickly tied into the prospect&rsquo;s challenge or situation. See tips here on how to use storytelling effectively in a presentation.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Is your structure built to persuade? </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the most effective structures for persuasive speeches and presentations, is broken into three parts: &ldquo;situation-complication-resolution.&rdquo; This persuasive structure is very popular among many successful TED presenters, like Daniel Pink, and I highly recommend it for moving prospects to take action in a sales presentation. Check out my post on &ldquo;Building a Persuasive Presentation&rdquo;</p><p> How did you do? </p>",

    "content": "<p> As the Middle East&rsquo;s main business hub, Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and home to the world&rsquo;s tallest manmade structure, the 163-story Burj Khalifa, which climbs to a neck-craning 2,717 feet. Designed by Adrian Smith, who attended Texas A&amp;M University, the Khalifa Tower is an engineering marvel and stands as a symbol not only of the futuristic and forward-thinking look of this oil-rich country but also its emphasis on seeking intellectual capital from all over the world.</p><p> Last week I had the pleasure of attending the annual  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ypo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Young Presidents&rsquo; Organization (YPO)  </a> </u>  event, held this year in Dubai, where I learned best practices on leadership as well as how to strike the right balance between business and family life. The YPO has 24,000 peer-to-peer members who together employ 15 million people across 130 countries and generate $6 trillion in revenue every year.</p><p> It was an enriching experience, equaled only by my admiration for what the UAE has managed to accomplish with its oil revenues. Tall construction cranes can be seen in every corner of Dubai, signaling urban growth. There are plans to expand its efficient light rail system, which shuttled me from the airport to downtown for only $1. I was happy to see many of the train stations colored gold.</p><p> <img alt=\"A sleekly designed monorail station in Dubai\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-sleekly-designed-monorail-station-in-dubai-03112016.jpg\"/></p><p> The Dubai Mall, the second-largest in the world, is a wonder to explore. It contains 1,600 stores and restaurants from the U.S. and Europe and also features the Dubai Aquarium, one of the world&rsquo;s largest. You truly feel as if you are in America, with the most popular restaurants being Five Guys Burgers and Fries, the Cheesecake Factory and U.S. pizza chains. I was surprised to see Tex-Mex food being delivered on motorcycles. As is the case in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/chinese-railway-stays-on-track/#.VuNWb_50zct\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   China  </a> </u>  and elsewhere, spending on infrastructure is key for long-term sustainable growth. Countries and city-states such as  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/a-tale-of-two-economies-singapore-and-cuba/#.VuNV4iseouI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Singapore  </u>  , </a>  Hong Kong and now Dubai have spent wisely on new airports, sea ports, subways, light rail and hospitals&mdash;all wise fiscal spending that has always given the U.S. a huge advantage. With oil revenues, UAE leadership has paid for citizens to earn degrees in America and military training in the U.S., including San Antonio, Texas. The city of Dubai has a massive U.S. naval base for regional security.</p><p> <img alt=\"The Sheikh Zayed Mosque\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-sheikh-zayed-mosque-key-place-workship-abu-dhabi-capital-uae-03112016.jpg\"/></p><p> This is the sort of extravagance and attention to detail travelers have come to expect from the country&rsquo;s most popular attractions. At the Palazzo Versace hotel in Dubai, for instance, visitors can beat the desert heat by relaxing in air-conditioned sand. In Abu Dhabi, the Shaikh Zayed Grand Mosque is believed to have the world&rsquo;s largest carpet, capable of accommodating more than 44,000 worshippers. The intricate craftsmanship of the marble and gold along the walls and columns is breathtaking to behold.</p><p> I also want to point out that the digital banking system has made a huge impact on the UAE&rsquo;s economy. I just read an article in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.khaleejtimes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Khaleej Times  </a> </u>  newspaper, reporting that electronic payments have boosted the UAE&rsquo;s GDP by $3.7 billion in five years. This increase is indicative of a trend of rising card usage across many countries, as you can see in the chart below.</p><img alt=\"The Impact of Electronic Payments\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-the-impact-of-electronic-payments-03112016.png\"/><br/> <p> In the same edition of the newspaper, I was interested to read that for the third year in a row, Singapore has been listed as the most expensive city in the world, followed by Zurich and Hong Kong.  According to the article, &ldquo;Falling commodity prices have created deflationary pressures in some countries, but in others, currency weakness caused by these falls has led to spiraling inflation.&rdquo;</p><h3> Light at the End of the Tunnel? The IEA Calls a Bottom in Oil Prices</h3><p> <br/> Despite its relatively small size in population and land mass, the UAE is the world&rsquo;s sixth-largest oil producer, following the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and Canada. Among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members, it&rsquo;s the second-largest, after Saudi Arabia.</p><p> These rankings might very well rise in the coming years, however, as the Middle Eastern country plans to expand production between 30 and 40 percent by 2020, even as Brent crude prices have struggled to crack $40 per barrel.</p><p> But on a global scale, oil production is finally dropping&mdash;and that&rsquo;s constructive for prices. In a report released on Friday, the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   International Energy Agency (IEA)  </a> </u>  writes that &ldquo;prices might have bottomed out,&rdquo; citing a February decline in both OPEC and non-OPEC output and hopes of U.S. dollar weakness.</p><p> Although I&rsquo;m cautious, the current recovery is in line with oil&rsquo;s seasonality trends for the five- and 15-year periods, which show that prices have risen between March and the beginning of the busy summer travel season.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-west-texas-crude-oil-historical-patterns-03112016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"West Texas Crude Oil Historical Patterns\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-west-texas-crude-oil-historical-patterns-03112016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> The PHLX Oil Service Sector Index has gained 4.4 percent since the beginning of the year, while prices have rallied above their 50-day moving average, touching three-month highs.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-oil-responds-to-seasonality-trend-03112016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Oil Responds to Easonality Trend\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-oil-responds-to-seasonality-trend-03112016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> As the IEA points out, this rally is being spurred by optimism that OPEC and Russia can agree on a production freeze&mdash;not a cut, as some people think. A meeting date has yet to be decided upon, however, presumably because Iran announced it will not agree to an output freeze until it reaches its pre-sanction market share.</p><p> Like Iran, Saudi Arabia has resisted capping production. To plug up the deficit, it&rsquo;s reportedly seeking up to $8 billion from international banks, the first time it has done so in more than a decade. The kingdom is also considering issuing foreign bonds and listing a part of its state oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil, or Aramco.</p><p> With WTI up 25 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in March, investor sentiment has improved since October, when it crossed into &ldquo;panic&rdquo; territory for the first time since 2011.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-investor-sentiment-improving-after-october-dip-03112016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Investor Sentiment Improving after October Dip\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-investor-sentiment-improving-after-october-dip-03112016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><h3> U.S. Companies Looking for $50 Per Barrel</h3><p> <br/> To remain profitable, most U.S. producers need oil prices to be above $50 per barrel&mdash;a level we haven&rsquo;t seen in eight months. In such an environment, U.S. oil companies are finally beginning to make meaningful production cuts, with the IEA expecting producers to remove more than half a million barrels per day from the market this year. In December, the monthly year-over-year change in production turned negative for the first time since September 2011.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-us-oil-production-dropping-off-03112016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"U.S. Oil Production Dropping Off\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-us-oil-production-dropping-off-03112016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> The number of North American rigs in operation fell below 400 for the first time since December 2009, according to Baker Hughes, helping to support prices.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-oil-prices-jump-on-further-rig-count-declines-03112016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Oil Prices Jump on Further Rig Count Declines\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-oil-prices-jump-on-further-rig-count-declines-03112016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> Until now, per-well productivity has been slow to budge. Years of $100-per-barrel oil incentivized companies to develop new ways to extract crude, including fracking, and these technological advancements have greatly increased efficiency. Today, not only can a new well be drilled in record time, it can also  <u>  <a href=\"http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/26318/global_oil_market.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   produce four to five times  </a> </u>  what it could have only five years ago.</p><h3> What Oil Companies Can Learn from Airlines</h3><p> <br/> Highly-leveraged companies across the globe have had little choice but to trim their workforces, curb expenditures and let go of undeveloped projects. According to consulting firm AlixPartners, overall capital spending fell 20 percent in 2015, with a further decline of at least 30 percent expected this year.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-global-oil-companies-slash-exploration-and-production-spending-03112016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Oil Companies Slash Exploration and Production Spending\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-11/COMM-global-oil-companies-slash-exploration-and-production-spending-03112016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> These adjustments, the most severe since the oil rout in the 1980s, have saved or raised global exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies $130 billion, says Deloitte Consulting. But this won&rsquo;t be enough for many companies: Nearly a third of all pure-play E&amp;P companies worldwide are at high-risk of bankruptcy this year.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing. A little over a decade ago, the airline industry also found itself in extreme duress. A large percentage of carriers landed in bankruptcy court, and a wave of consolidation swept through the industry. Today, airlines are positing record quarterly profits.</p><p> In the past year, we&rsquo;ve already seen some huge mergers and acquisitions in the oil industry&mdash;think Dutch Royal Shell and BP, as well as the proposed Halliburton and Baker Hughes deal. It&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;ll see many more in the coming months. In the meantime, short of geopolitical turmoil, a coordinated production cap agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC countries might be the only option to firm up prices.</p>",

If you had to put a value on your web of connections &ndash; what would it be? <br/>  </h3><p> A renewed focus on building a valuable network, each week, could undoubtedly result in a growing pipeline of new business. If most of our best clients come as introductions from others, then maybe what we need are more of the &ldquo;others&rdquo; to help us.</p><p> In the book The Connectors, I wrote about the one unique thing that most super successful individuals in the world possess. I have spent a lot of time researching and considering their intellectual power, their competitiveness, their determination, their implementation strategies, their staff, their funding options &mdash; and just about anything that you can think of that may distinctively contribute to such positive results.</p><p> However, when we break down the characteristics that extraordinary business people possess, many of them are what we may consider to be some of the obvious enviable traits: Persistence, drive, hard work, intelligence, ability to generate new ideas, ability to change, and a &lsquo;never take no for an answer&rsquo; mindset, etc. However &mdash; there is one more key characteristic: an individual&rsquo;s particular ability to connect with others and form a meaningful network of business relationships.</p><p> Connecting is truly a &ldquo;secret to success&rdquo; because it is often dismissed. We have a tendency to brush off the importance of our ability to connect and create relationships as a key contributor and explanation for business success.</p>",

    "title": "Do You Know These Five Major Areas of Applying Blockchain Technology?",
    "link": "do-you-know-these-five-major-areas-of-applying-blockchain-technology",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Flying back from Oslo after the SWIFT Nordics Conference, I was reflecting on the blockchain discussion we had.</p><p> I chaired the discussion which was titled: &ldquo;Blockchain: from hype to real world applications&rdquo; and was joined by Vytautas Karalevicius from Spectro Finance, Lasse Meholm of Nordea and Colin Kwan from Magnr.</p><p> It is clear that there are a number of major areas for applying the blockchain technologies emerging but, right now, it seems to me there are five big ones. </p><h3> 1) Smart Contracts <br/>  </h3><p> This is the biggest area where we are seeing transformation, with some seeing this as more revolutionary for the legal industry than banking or other areas.  This is because law is being digitalised.  Right now, look at any legal structure and there&rsquo;s a raft of paperwork involved.  That&rsquo;s good for the solicitors, barristers and litigators as keeping track of their paper trails is half the cost of any exchange, but if we digitise all those contractual instruments, then everything changes.  This is what firms like Stampery are focused upon &ndash; being the digital notary of choice &ndash; because you can record something on a shared ledger and, once recorded, it is irrefutable digital proof that this thing happened at that time on this date between these counterparties.  This could be anything from a marriage vow to a divorce proceeding; a house sale to a land reclamation; a purchase of a diamond to an insurance claim for the loss of a diamond; and anything else that involves digital proof.  Provenance is the killer app for blockchain protocol and it is why companies like  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2016/01/the-heart-of-the-blockchain-use-case-digital-proof.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Everledger </a>  are winning all the plaudits, as early examples of how compelling digital proof though smart contracts can be.  After all, if it can wipe out half the costs and people involved in administering our legal and litigation systems, then unemployed lawyers are surely a good thing?</p><h3> 2) Smart Assets <br/>  </h3><p> Recording the transacting of anything with a clear date and time stamp becomes even more compelling when we apply this to assets, especially assets in trade finance. Think of all those components being brought and sold in the supply chains of the world, and then think about all of those components being recorded in near real-time on a shared ledger. That&rsquo;s smart assets in the supply chain.  We have talked for a long time, for example, about real-time Treasury workstations but you can never have real-time when bills of lading and letters of credit have to be recorded and documented against asset movements. Digitalise the bills of lading and letters of credit and you suddenly have a much smarter view of the world. This is already revolutionising trade finance, working capital and supply chain management, with companies like Tradle and Wave leading the way.  The key is that a smart asset system cannot just record the asset in the supply chain, it&rsquo;s serial numbers and value, but any other information we need to know about that asset. Who is it coming from and where is it going to; how it relates to other assets in the supply chain; the shipper and receiver of the goods at port or airport; the components and component value that comprise the asset; tax and government clearance information; and more. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a smartasset tracking system and, for banks competing in the internet age, this becomes the competitive battleground.  After all, we all talk about banking differentiation being based upon information enrichment in the future. Therefore, a bank that is rich in data, can be rich in turning that data into information for their corporate clients. This will be a big area of competitive development over the next decade.</p><h3> 3) Clearing and Settlement <br/>  </h3><p> In the shorter term, clearing and settlement is proving to be the most active use case area for blockchain in banking, mainly because it gives a short-term win with real cost savings. Clearing and settlement costs billions and, according to Santander&rsquo;s 2015 report LINK, it is estimated that moving this into a digital record, near real-time and over the internet, will save the industry $20 billion a year in more in overhead costs due to D+3.  D+3, or T+3, is the three-day clearing and settlement cycle common to most investment markets today. D+3 is the reason we have custodial services (CSDs), central counterparty clearing systems (CCPs) and complex collateral management as intra-day, end of day and after three days, we have to ensure all counterparty balances are matched, reconciled and resolved across global trading system involving thousands of investors, day traders, pensions funds, market makers, assert managers and more. It is complex stuff and not necessarily resolved by blockchain in its entirety. For example, there&rsquo;s some advantage in having D+3 when you have a financial meltdown.  Nevertheless, many firms are leading the charge to digitalise the clearing and settlement structures from Blythe Masters&rsquo; Digital Asset Holdings with the Hyperledger to Overstock with T0, along with many other key and emerging players such as Epiphyte, Clearmatics and SETL. Eventually, there will be a new cleating system created out of the blockchain and what intrigues me the most is who will be running it.</p><h3> 4) Payments <br/>  </h3><p> SWIFT is developing projects around blockchain for payments transactions, as are many of the banks, with R3 being the lead player in such activities.  R3, backed by 42 of the world&rsquo;s largest banks, has already started experiments with Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure-based Blockchain-as-a-Service to develop Erethreum as a bank-to-bank global transaction system. It&rsquo;s an experiment today, but tomorrow &hellip; this is going to be a critical development area, and it&rsquo;s not just for global bank-to-bank transfers but any exchange of value over the internet peer-to-peer. In fact, the emerging value exchange models between players in Africa is highly likely to result in digital currencies being created that avoid the high exchange costs of Western Union or other remittance players. However, there is one factor that begs the question: is blockchain really suitable for payments? Scalability.  The bitcoin blockchain processes transactions within ten minutes if you&rsquo;re lucky, and in an hour or more if you&rsquo;re not. Each transaction, when you load mining costs into the system, costs about $6 and this will increase once all bitcoins have been mined, as a fee-based system will be required to run the blockchain. I have yet to see anyone convincingly skirt around the scale and cost factors of blockchain in payments, which means that we don&rsquo;t yet have a faster and cheaper system than what we already have today in the form of STEP2, SWIFT and ACH systems. We might tomorrow, but there&rsquo;s still a fair crack of technical work and experimentation to be made before I&rsquo;m convinced that we can process trillions of transactions a second on a blockchain protocol.</p><h3> 5) Digital Identity <br/>  </h3><p> Having said that, we do need some form of technology as a by-product of blockchain to enable us to do trillions of transactions a second for near-free as the Internet of Things (IoT) is coming.  You cannot have IoT without IoV (the Internet of Value); and IoV needs MoIP (Money over Internet Protocol) to operate.  So there will be a payments structure developed for MoIP as a foundation for IoT, and that MoIP system will enable machine-to-machine commerce.  Then this might be the way in which blockchain feeds into scalability of payment transactions.   If Digital Identities are recorded on blockchain protocol, then my things can have authorisation to transact on my behalf.  In other words, I have an identity recorded on a shared ledger, and then can add devices to my identity.  Over time, I add smart objects too, from my shoes to my fridge to my car to my heating to my spectacles to my anything.  This is where the most likely breakthrough will come before payments, as companies such as Shocard and Onename are developing ideas in this space fast.</p><h3> So there you have the big five developments in blockchain use cases in finance today: <br/>  </h3><li> Smart Contracts</li><li> Smart Assets</li><li> Clearing and Settlement</li><li> Payments</li><li> Digital Identity</li><p> There are others but, for now, focus your thinking on these as they&rsquo;re going to give you the short-term gains and long-term benefits.</p>",

I&rsquo;m going there today: TWITTER! Before you completely bow out of the conversation, what if I told you there&rsquo;s a really cool place you can go to get your Twitter content and you don&rsquo;t even have to post it &ndash; it will do it for you?</p><h3> Now that I have your attention&hellip;</h3>I had heard Tim Fargo&rsquo;s name for a very long time. If you worked in social media &ndash; you would too. <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alphabet-Success-Keeping-Simple-Success-ebook/dp/B00DTWQXGG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  He wrote an awesome book back in 2013 called &ldquo;Alphabet Success </a></u>&ldquo; and while promoting the book he figured out what a lot of us already knew in financial services: it takes a long time to schedule tweets! It&rsquo;s the number one reason I hear financial service professionals avoid Twitter &ndash; sheer time! Gah!!Tim (along with a few others) developed an application out of a need to save time which would post tweets on your behalf. You simply go to <u> <a href=\"http://www.tweetjukebox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://www.tweetjukebox.com </a></u> and sign-up for an account to connect your Twitter account, you then select your &ldquo;jukebox&rdquo; which plays the type of content you want your followers to see, and then&hellip;you kind of set it and forget it.<h3> But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</h3>I started using this tool right at the end of 2015 and I have to say, it&rsquo;s been some of the most engaging posts on my Twitter account. I chose their free Quote Jukebox and turned it on. I was not really sure it would make a difference, but it was free &ndash; so why not, right? It definitely couldn&rsquo;t hurt.I&rsquo;m three months in to using this platform. My impressions on Twitter have increased, my mentions have increased, the quality of my connections have increased. Basically &ndash; my Twitter got better because I&rsquo;m playing that funky content on my Twitter without spending one single minute of my time doing it. Now THAT is worth talking about!<h3> Taming Twitter</h3>Tim Fargo&rsquo;s idea which was crafted out of a simple need has literally tamed my Twitter content conundrum. The quality of the TweetJukebox quotes plus the interaction I&rsquo;m receiving on Twitter (and in case you are wondering, the sentiment has been 100% positive &ndash; not a single negative reaction to date) means this tool has value.The free version includes two jukebox subscriptions, but the paid version is only $13 per month and you can have access to ten jukebox subscriptions &ndash; and there is a lot of stuff to choose from, plus &ndash; you can add your own jukebox and be a content producer, should you want to go that route.TweetJukebox allows you a new, funky and fresh way to reach out to your audience without a lot of time and effort on your part. This is very attractive to many of us in financial services and I challenge you to try this tool and let me know how it goes!Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today!",

    "content": "<p> If you're in B2B marketing, chances are that one of your top priorities will be to drive more leads. So that&rsquo;s what I want to focus on in today&rsquo;s post, drawing on some good advice from a recent article on b2bmarketing.net.</p><p> When your sales team ask you to deliver more leads to help meet sales targets, it's not quantity they're looking for, but quality. Quality leads convert more often and usually at a higher value, and sales teams also prefer them because they tend to require a lot less effort!</p><h3> So, how can marketing teams improve the quality of those all-important leads?</h3><p> <br/> Online visitors to your website can come from a number of sources, including paid advertising, organic search, personal recommendations and social media. The last of those is a channel many still B2Bs seem to struggle with. But with the influence of social media growing all the time - and B2B buyers from all sectors using these social networks for advice and recommendations - it&rsquo;s essential to take full advantage of the high-quality new business leads that are now out there.</p><p> One of the key tricks for generating leads through social media is changing your mindset; so rather than thinking of social of something that 'has to be done&rsquo;, think of it as a integral marketing tool for growing a captive audience and presenting your business as the experts. With a recent analyst company report showing that 75% of B2B buyers are now using social media to make purchasing decisions, it's time to start viewing your channels as advanced search engines that prospects are going to use to find out more about you.</p><p> Secondly, it's important to know which channels are likely to be most effective for you. It's unlikely that most B2B buyers would use Facebook when making a business purchasing decision; on the other hand, the same analyst report found that well over half of all B2B buyers now use LinkedIn at some point in their decision-making process.</p><p> Finally, if you haven't figured out exactly how LinkedIn works or quite what a huge opportunity it represents for you B2B business, you need to get more familiar with the channel. Optimising your profile; publishing long-form posts; monitoring discussions; managing the growing opportunities to take advantage of paid-for LinkedIn exposure.</p><p> All this takes time, resources and expertise. If you feel you&rsquo;re lacking in any of these areas, feel free to get in touch!</p>",

Tips for using a teleprompter.</p><p> Speaking to a big audience can be overwhelming. Facing a teleprompter for the first time can make the event even more overwhelming.</p><p> Here are four practical tips:</p><h3> 1) Don&rsquo;t let the teleprompter intimidate you <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s just a tool.  It can make your work much easier (after all, you don&rsquo;t have to memorize your speech). What&rsquo;s more, it can improve your delivery (thanks to all the good eye contact a teleprompter makes possible).</p><h3> 2) Introduce yourself to the teleprompter operator right away and ask any questions you might have <br/>  </h3><p> Prompter operators are highly skilled. They work largely on a referral basis (some serve the same convention each year for a decade or more), so you can be confident in their expertise. Put their experience and knowledge to work for you.</p><h3> 3) Don&rsquo;t change your speaking pace to follow the teleprompter <br/>  </h3><p> The operator is trained to follow you!</p><h3> 4) Speeches given via teleprompter work best when they are written in a broadcasting format <br/>  </h3><p> For example: Don&rsquo;t write 20,000. You might look at the screen and accidentally say 2,000 or 200,000.  Instead, spell out the numbers: &ldquo;twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>",

Views depend on who is doing the looking, and what perspective, discipline, and/or paradigm is used.</p><h3> Take the concept MURDER.</h3><p> <br/> Different people look at &ldquo;murder&rdquo; differently. For example, A crime scene investigator will take photographs of the body, the weapon, the surroundings, the victims clothing, and other items in and around the scene. In art, there is a famous painting (above) of Jean-Paul Marat, a French politician, assassinated in his bathtub by Charlotte Corday, his political enemy. The picture records a historical event, but a priest would say it records a sin. A biologist would describe the effects of a puncture wound to the body, while a writer would write a &ldquo;who-done-it&rdquo; and perhaps sell a script to a producer. Marat&rsquo;s family would probably view his death as a tragedy, a revolutionary might proclaim his death a victory and Corday a heroine.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-16-at-1.28.55-PM-2.png\" width=\"356\"/><h3> One idea, many ways of looking at it, all correct.</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s preaching to the choir, yet in matters of the business future, something we tend to forget. When we think of business goals, all of a sudden we want to limit views to ours, have everyone in the same picture.</p><p> In the present, we have multiple concepts and goals already. Just ask your co-workers: How&rsquo;s business, and you&rsquo;ll know.</p><h3> So, how&rsquo;s business?</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ten percent behind our sales goal&rdquo; is a very different answer from &ldquo;Well, my new CRM system is three months late,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our market share is down five percent,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Really my biggest challenge is getting the team to come together.&rdquo; Yet these answers can be given by colleagues on the same day.</p><p> People don&rsquo;t have to agree on one business agenda to be able to work together. The only thing they share is the responsibility that they will show up and do their part of the deal well.</p><p> And the further we look ahead, the larger the discrepancy in views becomes. So general consensus will get you nowhere. However, you do need a common story for all to relate their personal view to.</p><p> The great thing of future scenarios is their layered, complex nature. The scenarios tell possible and probable stories of future business environments in which your company has to thrive. Within those stories, the roles above are all included.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re working on the future mission, vision, and strategy of your business, it&rsquo;s good to realize the various roles in play. All those roles need to find new meaning in the future. The more detailed the story of your preferred business future is, the easier co-workers can find anchors to latch onto. Instead of having a one-dimensional mission and vision, you&rsquo;ll have a concrete, yet multifaceted and inclusive scenario.</p><p> <strong>  PS. </strong> You&rsquo;ll be a more effective change manager if you&rsquo;d be able to map the different views on change and find their common threads. Take (one of the) concrete, future goals. Put this in the center of a think-flower (as the one above). Put the most important players in the leaves. As you go around the leaves, think about the various ways people think about the goal you&rsquo;ve chosen and record your findings.</p>",

    "link": "4-reasons-why-you-should-invest-in-sales-forecasting-technology",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> If sales is part art, and part science, then sales forecasting is a dark art. <br/>  </h3><p> According to recent numbers from CSO Insights, roughly 54% of all forecasted deals by sellers never make it to the finish line.</p><p> Which begs the question: what if we just had sales forecasting technology run the numbers for us?</p><p> As it turns out, the very traits that make sellers great at selling, also make them lousy at forecasting. Salespeople tend to be optimistic, which is great if you&rsquo;re looking for a group of folks who can keep going in the face of severe adversity &ndash; but killer if you&rsquo;re looking for an accurate assessment of what the future holds.</p><p> Salespeople are also diplomatic and politically astute, with often a high degree of &ldquo;willingness to please&rdquo; their constituents. Again, not a bad thing if you&rsquo;re selling complex, high-end services, but a sure way to sales forecasting that is way (way) off the mark.</p><p> The reasons why the very best sellers make the very worst forecasters are simple: human bias and social dynamics. Many sellers either have &ldquo;happy ears&rdquo; (meaning they are likely to substantially overestimate the likelihood of a deal happening), or they do what is called &ldquo;sandbagging&rdquo;.</p><p> According to Investopedia, &ldquo;(To) Sandbag is a tactic used to hide or limit expectations of a company&rsquo;s or individual&rsquo;s strength in order to produce greater than anticipated results. Sandbagging, in business, is most often seen when company managers temper the expectations of superiors or shareholders by giving guidance below what they know will be achieved. Once the better than expected results are presented, the firm looks all the better.&rdquo;</p><p> In other words, when sandbagging, reps deliberately underestimate the likelihood of a deal happening in an effort to look better to their peers/boss when it does.</p><p> And it&rsquo;s not just about the estimate itself &ndash; a recent study by Implisit found that opportunities closed a full 54 days after sales reps estimated it would.</p><p> Whether over- or underestimating, the end result is the same: sales forecasts that are way off the mark, which can have a dramatic impact on corporate earnings, share price and investor confidence. Not to mention the future career prospects of the individual seller and his/her manager.</p><p> But what&rsquo;s the alternative? Well, sales forecasting technology.</p><p> As it turns out, by using predictive analytics, pattern-matching and machine learning, sales forecasting technology is far better at sales forecasting than any human ever could be.</p><p> According to data from Entrepreneur Magazine, &ldquo;these (technology) processes achieve an average 82 percent forecast accuracy on a deal-by-deal basis (versus the 46 percent CSO Insights reported) and over 95 percent accuracy in the aggregate (versus the industry average of 76 percent).</p><p> I&rsquo;ll take those odds any day of the week.</p><p> So, with that in mind, let&rsquo;s take a look at 4 reasons why you should invest in sales forecasting technology</p><h3> 1) Better forecasts = better decisions, budgeting and resource allocation <br/>  </h3><p> Unless you&rsquo;re a highly analytical person, you probably don&rsquo;t forecast for the sheer joy of it. Much like forecasting the weather, we forecast because we want to do something with that information.</p><p> Maybe we&rsquo;re looking to reinvest revenue generated from product sales. Decide to launch a new product or service line based on the success of an existing one. Budget hires, skills development and training for the sales force.</p><p> Whatever the case, better sales forecasting means better decisions.</p><h3> 2) It&rsquo;s better for the salesforce, too <br/>  </h3><p> Take your average sales rep. How much do you think they enjoy the forecasting process?</p><p> Not only is it fraught with the potential for mistakes and career-damaging errors (as we&rsquo;ve seen before), but it&rsquo;s a horrible use of time for your highly-paid outside sales force. If you&rsquo;re anything like most sellers (at least the good ones), you&rsquo;d rather gouge your eyeballs out with an ice pick than typing forecast data into Excel.</p><p> As it turns out, it&rsquo;s a bit of a time sink as well. The average seller reports spending around two and a half hours on forecasting &ndash; per week. Think about it: every single seller, sales manager and leader is spending roughly 5% of their time on nothing but forecasting.</p><p> Every. Single. Week.</p><h3> 3) Technology forecasts actually get better with time <br/>  </h3><p> Through machine learning, technology actually &ldquo;learns&rdquo; how to forecast better with time. Once you set your model, over time it will become more and more accurate (instead of staying the same, or potentially getting worse).</p><p> And the best news of all? It will do this automatically, without you having to lift a finger, or invest time and money in training.</p><h3> 4) You can forecast further out, and run simulations <br/>  </h3><p> In some industries, sales cycles can either be extremely long or extremely short. Neither is great for improving the accuracy of sales forecasts. If you&rsquo;re trying to build a quarterly forecast with sales cycles averaging 7-10 days, good luck getting it right.</p><p> Technology can use the same predictive analytics it uses to forecast on a quarterly basis to simulate what would happen two, three, four, or sixteen quarters out. With the click of a button.</p><p> Plus, you can run simulations (much) easier. What would happen if sales for a specific product line increased by 5% ? If we added three more inside sales reps? If sales temporarily dropped due to seasonal changes?</p><p> As it turns out, if sales forecasting is a dark art, then using technology to forecast sales may just be your magic wand.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Buying a home is imbedded in the American Dream. <br/>  </h3><p> But with the price increases we&rsquo;ve all seen over the past 15 years&mdash;and no end in sight&mdash;buying today seems like a much bigger hill to climb then it was back in the &ldquo;glory days&rdquo; of 2000.</p><p> Last weekend, my friend Jim pulled out a clipping from the March 6 edition of the Denver Post.</p><p> The article highlighted skyrocketing home prices in the little mountain town of Salida, Colorado.</p><p> It caught his attention because Salida is the town his daughter, Olivia, has been eyeing for over a year, but she&rsquo;s been hoping homes would become more affordable.</p><p> Married with two little girls, Olivia and her husband are eager to buy in a small community like Salida, but Jim is concerned they&rsquo;re already priced out. And if I believed everything I read, I would be too.</p><p> The article painted the future of home buying as downright hopeless, saying that the average home price more than doubled over the past 15 years&mdash;from $124,600 in 2000 to $287,400 in 2015&mdash;and, even worse, that average wages didn&rsquo;t keep up with house prices (not even close!).</p><p> In fact, while housing prices more than doubled, wages only increased by 25%. It&rsquo;s a pretty dismal tale, and Jim clearly wanted some advice. &ldquo;How will they be able to afford anything decent? Has affording a home really become America&rsquo;s pipe dream?&rdquo;</p><p> Jim was upset by the article, and I agree that those are some scary statistics. But what bothered me most about the article wasn&rsquo;t the content, but that it stopped short of telling the whole story. Of course, the headline wouldn&rsquo;t be as thrilling, but if you look at the details of what&rsquo;s happening, the real news may be a dream come true for today&rsquo;s homebuyers.</p><p> What the Denver Post article (and many more like it) didn&rsquo;t take into account is how today&rsquo;s low interest rates impact affordability.</p><p> As I told Jim, all you need to do is compare interest rates then and now, and you suddenly see a completely different picture&hellip;one that just may have Olivia sitting pretty in a new home.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s the rest of the story: <br/>  </h3><li> In 2000, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 8%. That means that if Olivia and her husband had put 20% down on a home priced at $99,680, their mortgage including principal and interest payment would have been $727 a month. Not bad, and very reasonable based on their household income at the time of $4,000 a month.</li><li> In 2015, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.75%. If Olivia and her husband had bought the same house 15 years later, it would now be priced at about $229,920. If they put down 20%, their monthly payment would have been $1,061, an increase of only $334 a month compared to 15 years earlier.</li><p> Olivia and her husband both work in Salida, where wages increased 25% in that 15-year time period. This means their household income was increased by $1,000 a month, more than making up the difference in the mortgage payment. That&rsquo;s not so bad is it? In fact, when you look at the big picture, that home in Salida may actually be more affordable today.</p><p> As I explained to Jim, here&rsquo;s where we are today: Yes, housing prices are continually moving up, but the combination of wage increases and low interest rates make housing at least as affordable as it was in 2000, if not more so. (Nationally, wages increased by even more than in the tiny town of Salida, though housing prices in many areas increased at a higher rate as well.) </p><p> So don&rsquo;t let the headlines fool you: the dream is not lost. If, like Olivia, you&rsquo;ve been waiting for an &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; time to buy, the time is now. Take advantage of historically low interest rates, be realistic about your budget so you&rsquo;re not buying more than you can afford, and go make your own dream come true.</p>",

    "content": "<p> My friend from South Africa, Marcel Oudejans, a fellow speaker (and magician), asked how I felt about this comment:</p><h3> &ldquo;If the customer you&rsquo;re serving thinks that they can do your job better than you, then you have a customer service problem.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> My response was simple: &ldquo;You get it. Spot on!&rdquo;</p><p> You&rsquo;ve been there, I&rsquo;m sure. As a customer, have you ever felt as if you could do a better job than the customer service rep you&rsquo;re talking to? Unfortunately, we sometimes encounter customer support reps, as well as salespeople and others with customer facing responsibilities, who aren&rsquo;t properly trained, are new and don&rsquo;t have the experience or knowledge to make good decisions, or are just having a bad day. The result is frustration. We may lose confidence in the business and their people. And, the worst case scenario, we may choose to stop doing business with the company.</p><p> But, let&rsquo;s turn this around. Let&rsquo;s say that you are the customer service rep, and you are knowledgeable, helpful and very qualified to take care of the customer and answer his or her questions. Yet you encounter a  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H86jY319fZo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  difficult customer </a>  who thinks they can do your job better than you do. What can you do?</p><p> Perhaps you&rsquo;ve tried using the techniques you&rsquo;ve been trained to use in difficult situations. You&rsquo;ve acknowledged the problem, apologized for it (even if it wasn&rsquo;t your fault), suggested different ways to resolve the problem and also of great importance, you&rsquo;ve remained calm. What else can you do?</p><h3> Well, here is an idea worth considering.</h3><p> <br/> I call it Letting the Customer Wear Your Shoes. It&rsquo;s a role reversal. You ask the customer this simple question: Mr. or Mrs. Customer, I want you to help me understand what you think a reasonable solution might be. Imagine the roles here are reversed. If I was your customer and came to you with this problem, what do you think we should do to resolve the problem?</p><p> This powerful technique is not meant to be used at the beginning of the conversation. This is when you are having a difficult time with the customer, and virtually everything you suggest isn&rsquo;t good enough.</p><p> Now be warned that this technique has a little risk to it. Even though it is a hypothetical situation, you are putting control in the customer&rsquo;s hands. That said, it can help defuse anger and sometimes it helps the customer realize that their demands may be a little extreme.</p><p> So, keep this technique in your &ldquo;hip pocket&rdquo; for the next time you feel like you&rsquo;ve exhausted all reasonable responses to your  <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/unintended-consequences-the-fallout-from-bad-customer-service/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   unhappy customers  </a> </u> . It may be just what you need to resolve your customer&rsquo;s problem.</p>",

You do so at your risk because they&rsquo;ll matter in some part of the process.2. Assume <strong> you&rsquo;re being observed</strong> (because somebody is probably actually watching you). It will make you sit up straighter (power pose!), pay attention to your manners, and act more professional.3.<strong> Learn from small successes</strong> the same way you do from big ones. Learning something new about your profession is never a waste. It&rsquo;s a way of future-proofing your career!4. Picking up new skills is vital, but <strong> proficiency requires practice</strong>. The practice part is where you need to focus.5. When you screw up, speak up quickly and <strong> apologize. With sincerity</strong>.6. Some people &mdash; myself included &mdash; believe that <strong> living at the edges</strong> is what makes life exciting. Whether you&rsquo;re fired up with outrage or blissfully serene, you&rsquo;re likely to be escaping mediocrity.7. Keep in mind that <strong> progress leaves a mark</strong>. Nurse your black eyes and sore muscles. Embrace the pain of lessons learned.8. What does it take to be successful? <strong> Everything you&rsquo;ve got</strong>. All the time.9. Ignore Them &mdash; you know, the folks who know what&rsquo;s best for you and can&rsquo;t wait to tout their theories. It&rsquo;s your life. <strong> Turn Them off.</strong>10. You didn&rsquo;t get where you are without support. Be deliberately aware &mdash; and thankful for &mdash;  those people who are generous with their time and energy on your behalf. Nobody does anything alone. <strong> Show your thanks</strong>.11. Believe in your capacity to be more &mdash; more amazing, more successful, a better person. <strong> Believe</strong> and it will be so.12. Get passionate and emotional about your goals. Fuel the win by <strong> digging deep and pushing hard</strong>.13. <strong> Surround yourself with people who are better than you</strong> at what you want to be the best at.14. Sometimes awesomeness is built over time. That&rsquo;s why you should <strong> do one thing every day that really matters</strong>.15.<strong> Negative people have no place in your life</strong> &mdash; even if they think they do.16. READ. <strong> Read everything under the sun</strong> and find the great lessons in what you read.17. If you need help, get the best. Do your research. <strong> Invest in the best you can afford</strong>. Trust the advice.18.<strong> Eliminate poor language</strong> (even thoughts) like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nike has the right idea &mdash; Just do it.19. Don&rsquo;t confuse the trappings of success with true success. <strong> An award isn&rsquo;t a win</strong>. The real reward doesn&rsquo;t come with a trophy.20.<strong> Aim for fitness</strong> on every level &mdash; financially, physically, and mentally. Always be ready to be a hero.",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Ashish_Shah\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Ashish Shah </a> ,  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Douglas_J._Peebles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Douglas J. Peebles </a>  </p><p> As policymakers try to support the real economy and protect the banking system, they&rsquo;re unwittingly conducting a war on market liquidity. We think this approach ensures they won&rsquo;t achieve either of their stated goals.</p><p> The Bank of Japan (BoJ) recently joined Denmark&rsquo;s Nationalbank, the Swiss National Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) and Sweden&rsquo;s Riksbank in adding negative interest rates to the offensive&mdash;with the ECB moving more negative again last week. This is a major escalation with dangerous consequences.</p><p> In order to successfully support sustainable growth and a sound banking system, policymakers must do a better job of coordinating their regulatory and monetary policies, or they risk creating their own serious crisis.</p><h3> Brave New World</h3><p> <br/> Following the downfall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, central banks started using unconventional monetary policy, launching large-scale quantitative easing (QE) programs. By effectively lowering &ldquo;risk-free&rdquo; interest rates, these programs encouraged investment in corporate bonds and stocks&mdash;which resulted in a corresponding rise in stock prices.</p><p> At the same time, policymakers developed a profusion of regulations aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 banking crisis. At the heart of these regulations were the raising of capital requirements and the limiting of risk-taking by banks.</p><p> Investors complied with policymakers by growing their stock and credit allocations. But, like banks, they too pursued strategies that limited the additional risk in their portfolios&mdash;by selling those investments if markets began to decline. The unfortunate side effect of such strategies was an increase in the demand for market liquidity during periods of market stress.</p><p> Meanwhile, banks had responded to the new regulations imposed on them by withdrawing from their historical role as short-term providers of liquidity to the capital markets. The result? Not even the US Treasury market was spared periodic liquidity vacuums.</p><p> The first shot had been fired in the war on liquidity.</p><h3> New World, New Risks</h3><p> <br/> While QE has helped the world avoid a deep and protracted slump, it has neither delivered strong and sustainable economic growth, nor banished the specter of deflation. With new threats looming&mdash;weak emerging-market growth, a possible hard landing in China&mdash;central banks have identified a radical solution.</p><p> Negative interest rates appear to be a desperate bid to underpin inflation expectations, preserve the credibility of inflation targets and prevent exchange rates from rising. What is the probability of success?</p><h3> Double, Double, Toil and Trouble</h3><p> <br/> We doubt they will achieve these broader aims. Although negative rates have helped drive bond yields unnecessarily lower, negative-rate policies could derail growth and endanger banks&rsquo; very existence.</p><p> Negative policies essentially use the same three monetary-transmission channels as QE: the exchange rate, asset prices and bank lending. And all three of these have problems.</p><p> <strong>  The exchange-rate channel is tough </strong>  when you&rsquo;re trying to be effective, because other central banks are employing similar strategies. Witness the recent sharp rise in the yen in response to the BoJ&rsquo;s negative rate shift. Remember that the BoJ was hoping to steer the yen into a gentle decline.</p><p> <strong>  The law of diminishing returns holds </strong>  that investors will question their ability to manage asset volatility in a declining liquidity environment, and as more and more investors exit the market, volatility will climb.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&rdquo;  </strong> doesn&rsquo;t really work for banks. Ultra-low to negative interest rates impinge on banks&rsquo; net interest margins, a critical component of banks&rsquo; future capital base. Combined with the impact of even more stringent regulation, this reduces banks&rsquo; willingness to lend to borrowers and further impairs banks&rsquo; already impeded ability to provide liquidity to markets.</p><p> Negative interest rates simply aren&rsquo;t the effective tool policymakers wish them to be. Instead, they&rsquo;re unwieldy, unpredictable and even dangerous. The risks of collateral damage to the financial markets&mdash;whether through erratic outcomes such as volatile currency markets or market liquidity seizing up&mdash;are simply too high.</p><p> The question then becomes whether there is an alternative. We believe there is.</p><p> Central banks: Lay down your arms. The war on liquidity must stop. Come together in coordinated deescalation across monetary and regulatory policies. Without coordinated efforts to sustain growth, avoid deflation and safeguard the global banking system, you may have nothing left worth fighting for.</p><p> The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.</p><p> A version of this blog was originally published on  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/07/negative-interest-rates-a-dangerous-weapon-commentary.html\" target=\"_blank\">   CNBC  </a> </u> .</p>",

However, alternative income-generating investments are not as &ldquo;plain vanilla&rdquo; as standard bonds, so we&rsquo;re sure to spend plenty of time choosing them carefully and monitoring their performance. And as with all investments, we carefully consider their suitability for each investor based on the investor&rsquo;s income and liquidity needs, risk tolerance and tax situation.</p><h3> Here are three alternatives we have been using judiciously. <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. High-yield unrated municipal bonds. Key characteristics: </strong></p><li> These are a long-term investment.</li><li> As with other muni bonds, the interest isn&rsquo;t taxable at the federal level. However, unless the bond is issued by your own state, you&rsquo;ll pay state income tax on the income.</li><li> Unrated muni bonds as a class have a higher default rate than rated munis, but a commensurately higher yield (6% is not uncommon) to offset that risk. It is therefore crucial to have an investment manager with lots of experience in this arena to be picking the unrated munis. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2. Private equity real estate. Key characteristics of a particular investment: </strong></p><li> Properties are apartments in communities with at least a &ldquo;B&rdquo; rating (on a real estate industry scale).</li><li> The multi-family complexes have high occupancy rates.</li><li> The investment manager has a more than 20-year track record providing immediate cash flow, some of which is tax-sheltered.</li><li> Investments are in a diversified pool of properties.</li><li> Investment units are available as part of a &ldquo;fund of funds&rdquo; with the high yield and master limited partnerships (MLPs). <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3. Midstream energy MLPs. Key characteristics: </strong></p><li> The sharp decline in oil prices has depressed prices in this sector as much as 65%, regardless of credit quality, driving up yields.</li><li> Partially tax-sheltered cash flow in the 8-12% range is available.</li><li> Investors should have faith that energy prices ultimately will begin to reverse course.</li><li> Many MLPs have &ldquo;increasing income&rdquo; contracts, meaning that investors won&rsquo;t be locked into today&rsquo;s yields.</li><li> Investments have credit ratings, and some have high ratings even in today&rsquo;s low energy price environment, due to strong balance sheets. <br/>  </li><p> As noted, these investments aren&rsquo;t for everybody, and must be chosen and monitored carefully, but suitably diversified income-seeking investors should at least give them a look.</p> <p>  </p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnRStoker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Stoker  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.dialogueworks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Dialogue Works  </u> </a></p><p> I was recently facilitating a class for executives teaching them how to hold potentially difficult conversations. One of the attendees asked me, <strong>  &ldquo;With all that we already have to do, is this really all that important?&rdquo; </strong> I walked to the whiteboard and drew a picture with the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; written vertically on the right, then I listed words like productivity, profitability, accountability, retention, job satisfaction, personal engagement, customer satisfaction, culture change, motivation, collaboration, and innovation in a column on the left. I then explained that a manager is the gateway to the accomplishment of the issues I had listed. If any of these areas are lacking, then the manager is essentially missing the opportunity to manage as effectively as he or she could. <strong>  That was the end of our conversation. </strong></p><p> Whatever issue you may currently be encountering, those are the opportunities for individuals to grow and develop. I like to say that &ldquo;your distress is the key to your success.&rdquo; In other words, whatever or whoever frustrates you the most at work is probably in need of your attention; your negative emotion becomes the cue to where you need to place that attention. I also hope that you recognize that the key to improving any of the eleven areas listed above, is dependent on your ability to talk about and work through such issues in a respectful and meaningful way. A manager&rsquo;s inability to effectively manage can be tied back to the way they communicate and interact with their people.  </p><p> What follows is a list of questions that you might find helpful to ask and candidly answer yourself. <strong>  Hopefully your answers will provide some insight about where you might give your full attention. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  1. How productive are your people? </strong></h3><p> <br/> I believe that you get what you measure. If you don&rsquo;t have specific measurements about who is performing well and who isn&rsquo;t, then it is difficult to know who needs your encouragement and who needs your further assistance to improve their performance.  </p><h3> <strong>  2. How does your group contribute to the profitability of your organization? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you are not sure, then I would bet that your people probably don&rsquo;t know either. You need to understand how you are using your resources and whether the use of those resources is providing the expected return on the investment. If the return does not match the effort, then something needs to change quickly.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Do your people meet the goals, deadlines, and expectations you provide? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If not, then you must first take a look at how specific you are in the directions you are providing. If you feel that their lack of performance is at fault, then you must ask yourself if you are talking to those people and providing the necessary information and ongoing feedback so that they can meet your expectations. You need to take a look at yourself first before you take a look at them.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Are you losing people to other companies or departments? </strong></h3><p> <br/> That should be evidence enough that something is not as it should or could be. People want to do well, and they will stay where there are opportunities to grow, learn, and make a meaningful contribution. When people are not getting what they need, they will search for other opportunities. You want to make sure that you are providing them with meaningful opportunities and that they know that you value their contribution.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Are people satisfied with their jobs? </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is closely tied to the previous question; however, if you haven&rsquo;t asked this question of anyone, then you need to recognize that you are missing the opportunity to learn how people view you and your leadership. If you don&rsquo;t have a more realistic view of yourself, then you won&rsquo;t know what you need to work on. You can&rsquo;t fix what you don&rsquo;t see or understand. </p><h3> <strong>  6. Are your people personally engaged? </strong></h3><p> <br/> This seems to be the current hot topic in the management field today. When you stop to consider that a recent  <a href=\"http://www.dialogueworks.com/pages/blogs.php?blog_id=97#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [1] </a>  Gallup survey suggests that only 30% of the workforce is engaged, you have to wonder what the other 70% of the folks are doing. You will not know unless you ask. You must begin to hold the types of conversations that will help you understand the hearts and minds of your people if you expect them to be engaged in what they are doing.</p><h3> <strong>  7. When was the last time you asked your customers how you are doing?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is the type of information you should actively seek. What your customers think of the services you provide will determine whether or not they will continue to be your customers. Most people have a choice in where they do business. You want to make their business your business. You can do that by talking with them and determining if you are meeting or exceeding their expectations. What you learn from holding these types of conversations will help you make the needed changes that contribute to the success of your company.</p><h3> <strong>  8. How does your culture impact performance?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Culture includes the general atmosphere in which people work. That atmosphere is created by the values that the organization endorses and what people actually believe and experience in relationship to those values. For example, if your company espouses work life balance, but management demands that everyone work 60+ hour per week or that they work six days a week, then something is out of alignment. The culture will impact how people view themselves within the organization and how they do their work. Learning about the cultural nuances that may be impacting performance is well worth your time.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Are your people motivated?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> You might answer this question by assessing whether or not people take the initiative to do work that might normally be part of their job description or whether they go out of their way to help and support others. Asking yourself these questions and then observing performance through that lens may help you learn some things about your people that you didn&rsquo;t know before.</p><h3> <strong>  10. Do people work and play well together?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> This question is intended to address collaboration. So much of the work we do requires that we rely upon one another. If individuals have difficulty working with one another, then the quality of the work is usually negatively impacted. If you manage a team that doesn&rsquo;t collaborate well together, then it is time to find out why and help those individuals figure out what needs to change about the way they think and work together.</p><h3> <strong>  11. What could be improved in the way your people do their work?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your people know what works and doesn&rsquo;t work or what could be improved to save time and money. If you are not taking the time to learn from them, then you are missing the opportunity to make some changes that will increase their work efficiency and will make them appreciate you for helping them to be more successful. Innovation should be part of what every manager does to help their team to be more successful.</p><p> I believe that it is vitally important that every manager realize that they are the gateway to the success that they expect to achieve. Taking advantage of the opportunity to hold these important conversations will contribute to increased success in your workplace while expanding your capacity as a manager.</p><p> Do you have a situation with either an employee, boss or significant other that you don&rsquo;t quite know how to handle? We want to help!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> One of the many challenges for the public sector is that it must start believing in people and communities again.</h3><p> <br/> We know that many organisations are out of sync with technology , but there&rsquo;s an argument that they are increasingly distant from an economy where sharing and collaboration trump paternalism and top down protocols.</p><p> One of the most  <u>  <a href=\"http://paulitaylor.com/2016/02/14/how-to-kill-creativity-and-how-to-rebuild-it/#comment-3826\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   interesting comments  </a> </u>  on my post  <a href=\"http://paulitaylor.com/2016/02/14/how-to-kill-creativity-and-how-to-rebuild-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   How To Kill Creativity  </u>    </a> was from  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/john_a_wade\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   John Wade  </a> </u> . In it he wondered whether the organisations that limit the creativity of their employees also inadvertently stifle citizen and community strengths.</p><p> I think the answer is almost certainly yes.</p><p> It&rsquo;s well established that meetings, emails and design by committee suck the creativity out of a business , so surely this would trickle down to the end user?</p><h3> If you have a risk averse culture surely you also contribute to risk aversion in communities?</h3><p> <br/> One of the more damaging ways we can stifle creativity is just by not listening. Of leaving the thinking to the &lsquo;experts&rsquo;.  If it was an idea worth having, the experts would already have thought about it. They have all kinds of qualifications and can write reports and they tend to use very long words. When there&rsquo;s a problem they really can&rsquo;t solve they will often bring in a consultant or make an appointment to their board.</p><p> We can also &ndash; without meaning to &ndash; make communities defer to authority. Everyone is a manager or an officer. This indicates that someone is in charge and is important. The people in charge must know what they are doing, or they wouldn&rsquo;t hold the positions that they do. They don&rsquo;t need any ideas on how the service could be run differently.</p><p> These behaviours are out of kilter with networked communities and the way we share information and resources.</p><p> If we approach public service purely as a one to one consumer transaction we&rsquo;ll view the world through the lens of efficiency, reduced contact, metrics and performance indicators.</p><p> In an economy moving towards sharing rather than just transacting we need to build a new set of behaviours based on trust, fondness, habit and traditions.</p><p> Huge parts of the public sector have designed services around what people can&rsquo;t do for themselves rather than nurturing what they can.</p><p> At  <a href=\"http://www.bromford.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bromford  </u>    </a> we are in the process of reshaping our organisation around the latter.  A move away from managing to  <u>  coaching and connecting </u> .</p><p> Every individual and community has assets, talents, skills and abilities. Better to focus on helping to develop and release these, rather than treating people as a series of &lsquo;problems&rsquo; that need to be solved.</p><p> If we think of our organisations as platforms to enable people &ndash; rather than just as service providers &ndash; it fundamentally changes how we seek out ideas.</p><p> Yesterday we hosted a discussion in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bromfordlab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bromford Lab  </a> </u>  kicking off a 12 week period looking at the problem, or opportunity, of loneliness.</p><p> What struck me more than anything was how the conversations we have are completely changed. Very quickly the contributors stopped talking about loneliness and starting talking about community connection. About amazing examples they had seen of people doing things together. Of Bromford leading by stepping back. Of the organisation no longer feeling it has to be omnipresent.</p><h3> Believing in what people can do means being brave enough to admit that we won&rsquo;t always be needed.</h3><p> <br/> Many of our public services are actually products of failure. They only exist because things don&rsquo;t work.</p><p> Planning for obsolescence may sound suicidal, but it&rsquo;s actually the most enlightened creative state your organisation can be in.  </p>",

    "title": "How to Redesign the Customer Experience With Four Moments of Truth",
    "link": "how-to-redesign-the-customer-experience-with-four-moments-of-truth",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> What are the Four Moments of Truth? And do they fit into experience design? <br/>  </h3><p> Last year I wrote about moments of truth, defining them as what makes or breaks a moment in the customer journey, that moment when, if all goes well, the customer will continue the journey and complete the task or interaction; he will do (or continue to do) business with you. If things go awry, he will not complete the interaction and will go elsewhere. <br/> <br/> I recently read Brian Solis' latest book, X: The Experience When Business Meets Design. In it, he devotes a chapter to moments of truth. He writes about the Four Moments of Truth: <br/> <br/> <strong>  Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) </strong></p><p> This moment of truth was introduced by Google and refers to that moment when people go online and search for what they need/want. <br/> <br/> <strong>  First Moment of Truth (FMOT) </strong></p><p> This moment of truth was coined by P&amp;G and refers to when people first see the product - or its alternatives - they are looking for.</p><p> <strong>  Second Moment of Truth (SMOT) </strong></p><p> Also introduced by P&amp;G, Brian says this isn't just a moment but a collection of moments. This is when the customer uses and experiences the product and the company supports the relationship.</p><p> <strong>  Third Moment of Truth (TMOT) </strong></p><p> Ex-P&amp;Ger Pete Blackshaw introduced this MOT back in 2006, and he basically refers that powerful inflection point where the product experience catalyzes an emotion, curiosity, passion, or even anger to talk about the brand. By opening up that pipeline, we not only absorb insight and deeper consumer understanding but also nurture empowerment and advocacy.   <br/> <br/> <strong>  Ultimate Moment of Truth (UMOT) </strong></p><p> Brian coined this term to refer to that moment when customers go online to review or to talk about products and the experience, basically the same thing as that TMOT, and cited that one person's UMOT is another's ZMOT. Interesting. <br/> <br/> (I know. Technically, that's five. Brian only wrote about four in his book; he wrote about UMOT, not TMOT, which others have cited as the fourth moment of truth.)</p><p> Here's what's interesting: these xMOTs help marketers and advertisers, but they aren't helpful to customer experience designers. I'd say these are more stages of truth than moments of truth. Moments are, well, moments; they are a (brief) point in time. These xMOTs relate more to stages in time, stages in the customer lifecycle, than they do to brief points in time.  <br/> <br/> The xMOTs are focused on the buyer journey and the customer lifecycle, not on the specific steps of a customer experience journey, where a customer is trying to achieve some task. That appears to be the difference between how we refer to moment of truth in customer experience design and these xMOTs. These xMOTs don't tell me what to fix; they might drive my digital/content strategy, though.  <br/> <br/> So, as a customer experience professional trying to redesign the experience, should you focus on the xMOTs? No, they're not meant for that purpose. They're just too high-level to be meaningful for design; design requires details. <br/> <br/> This reminds me of when I wrote about the differences between lifecycle maps and journey maps: focusing on the lifecycle is high level and is good for understanding the overall relationship the customer has with the organization, from before he's even considered a customer through when he is no longer a customer. <br/> <br/> To really transform the experience, you need to focus on those specific make-or-break points the customer experiences along the journey to complete some task or to do some job. Details are important. You can't transform something you don't understand. The xMOTs don't help you understand those moments that cause customers to stay or go. They can help you engage with customers, but after you engage, then what? If the experience itself is broken, then your engagement is over.</p>",

    "title": "3 Tips For Talking to Senior Executives",
    "link": "3-tips-for-talking-to-senior-executives",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> \"I have a lot of trouble communicating with my boss and other senior executives at work. I've tried so many different approaches and none of them have worked. At this point I'm pretty sure I'm over thinking everything. What's your advice?\" <br/>  </h3><p> This is one of the most frequent questions I get asked from my career coaching clients and from people on my team. If you get nervous talking to executives or if you get flustered and feel like a hot mess every time you speak to your boss, the first thing to know is that you're not alone. I have to admit that even now after almost 20 years in business, from time to time things can still get a bit weird when I talk to senior leaders without a good game plan in place. </p><p> Some executives make it harder than others. I've worked with leaders in the past that seemed to make a point of being hard to communicate with. Almost as though making me nervous and seeing me struggle was a game for them.</p><p> Thankfully, a lot of this alpha dog management behavior is going away as companies in most industries are evolving and growing. As an executive myself, my entire management philosophy is to make the people on my team feel as comfortable as possible. In my experience people are at their best when they feel confident and comfortable so I don't really see the point in making them nervous and inflicting any unnecessary stress by being difficult to communicate with.</p><p> I have to admit though, I haven't always been this way, and I think we have a ways to go before that philosophy is widespread. Until the day where every executive has adopted this type of approach, we'll continue to struggle to find the right way to communicate effectively with them.</p><p> In my experience most employees fall into one of two profiles when it comes to communicating with senior leaders. </p><h3> The Wet Noodle <br/>  </h3><p> Let me start by saying i have no idea why I've tried to use a pasta reference to illustrate this point. But let's go with it. Anyhow ... most people fall into the wet noodle camp when it comes to communicating with senior managers. They want to be demonstrably respectful of their boss or executive leader. They also worry about their ideas being wrong so they try not to take a firm stand on any particular point of view. They tend to talk around issues. They tend to meander and preface and provide context instead of making decisive points. They constantly hedge and defer to the executive for his or her opinion. I've even seen some people consistently append a disclaimer to every recommendation they make. Something like, \"I think we consider stopping this program .... unless you don't feel that's the right thing to do ...\" </p><p> Even though I can understand what leads people to this approach, it inevitably backfires, and can really do damage to your personal brand if you're not careful. You don't want to be a wet noodle. Yes, you want to be deferential. No, you don't want to shove ideas down your boss's throat. But you have to be decisive and provide value.</p><p> When all you do is talk around in circles to your boss and never make any strong point, you are pretty clearly communicating, whether you know it or not, that you have limited value to bring to the table. You should be trying to make your boss's job easier - not just talk around in circles and have her do all the decision making for you.</p><p> If you haven't read, David Marquet's book Turn that Ship Around, it provides some excellent examples of what the ideal superior - subordinate relationship should look like.</p><h3> The Rigid Rigatoni <br/>  </h3><p> Fewer people fall into this camp, but its growing. I see it more frequently these days as millennials move into the workplace. Obviously this is the exact  opposite of the wet noodle. In an attempt to appear confident and competent, some people are way to aggressive in how they present ideas and information to senior executives. This stems from a need to feel respected and can often manifest after a number of years operating in wet noodle mode. We give ourselves a pep talk before meeting with an executive. We promise not to be a door mat this time. 9 times out of 10 this ends badly.</p><p> We present an idea too passionately, we stop thinking creatively, we respond badly to constructive feedback or alternative perspectives. I even see some people, in an attempt to not be seen as a wet noodle, try to talk with the executive like they're bffs. They try to take it to the friend zone when they weren't invited. This one makes me cringe a bit because I see it quite a bit these days and its embarrassing frankly. Unless you are actually close friends with your boss or an executive at your company, don't act like you're long lost buds ... brah.</p><p> The impact of being too rigid, too friendly or too aggressive when speaking with executives is that you come off as cocky, reckless and disrespectful. You really don't want to be here. So if you've found yourself recently getting into heated arguments trying to defend your ideas to your boss, or you've caught yourself trying to fist bump senior executives at work - you're a Rigid Rigatoni and you need to stop.</p><p> Here are my three best tips for communicating with a boss or senior executive. Its an approach that has always helped me strike the right balance between being respectful and being decisive.</p><h3> 1) Lead with the Headline <br/>  </h3><p> Many of us make the mistake of taking too long to make our major points. We provide too much context. We work our way up to making our point. We do this because we we're scared that if we don't, our ideas will get rejected or the executive will assume we haven't considered all the variables. That's flawed logic. The best way to communicate with an executive is to lead with the headline e.g. \"My recommendation is that we cancel the program - its costing us too much money and its not showing enough growth potential\". This way you don't force your boss to sit and listen to a bunch of context - you just get to the point first - then you provide context.</p><h3> 2) Share your Thought Process <br/>  </h3><p> Once you've made the big point, now you can offer to walk the executive through the process you used to come to that recommendation. This is how you demonstrate your objectivity and the quality of your thinking. For example after giving her the headline now you can say, \"... and I'd be happy to walk you through my decision process and the other alternatives I considered.\" This way you're now engaging the executive in the conversation and giving her a window into how you think - into your value. I talk a lot more about the decision making process in my book.</p><h3> 3) Ask for Advice <br/>  </h3><p> Now that you've given your boss the headline and offered insight into your decision making framework, you need to ask for advice or input to make it better. Inevitably your boss or senior leader is going to want to add value - that's their job. Its your job to take that advice and use it to make your work better. So instead of being a wet noodle and saying \"... unless you don't think its a good idea\", you might say something like, \"I'd love to get your perspective and advice on how to make this even better.\" This way you've been decisive, you've shown objectivity in your decision process and now you're showing respect by asking for advice. </p><p> By presenting information to executives this way you effectively balance between the need to be respectful and the need to deliver value. Your tone is decisive but not rigid. You aren't entrenched in a position but you're confident in a decision making approach which led to a recommendation.</p><p> Hope this advice was helpful. Let me know in the comments section about your experiences (good and bad) with talking to senior execs.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Men around the world have more self-esteem than women, according to a study of age and gender differences in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. <br/>  </h3><p> The study cited two previous reports that established, generally, that men have higher self-esteem than women and that self-esteem increases from late adolescence to middle adulthood for both men and women.</p><p> However, this Journal of Personality and Social Psychology study expanded this beyond the earlier, very Western-centric samples to take a cross-cultural look at the issue, finding the same trend.</p><p> Self-esteem was measured using a self-reporting scale called the Single-Item Self-Esteem scale in which participants rated the item &ldquo;I see myself as someone who has high self-esteem&rdquo; on a five-point scale.</p><p> The study notes some insights into cultural differences in the magnitude of the self-esteem gap among different cultures. In other words, while globally men showed higher levels of self-esteem than women and self-esteem increased with age worldwide among the sample, some countries had a smaller gap than others.</p><p> The study noted that significant factors in the size of the gap were gross domestic product (GDP), Human Development Index and age at marriage. Not surprisingly, the greater a country&rsquo;s wealth and level of development, the greater the self-esteem of both men and women; however, it&rsquo;s interesting the way this gap narrows as people become better off.</p><p> This study has interesting implications and raises some intriguing cause and effect questions as they relate to the business world.</p><p> For instance, does the self-esteem gap contribute to, or result from:</p><li> The wage disparity between men and women?</li><li> The higher proportion of men reaching top executive positions?</li><li> The number of same-gender role models within organizations?</li><p> This particular study doesn&rsquo;t attempt to answer these questions, but they&rsquo;re questions worth pondering, particularly given the apparent narrowing of the gap among those who are better off and those at lower levels of the socioeconomic ladder.</p><p> Consider the implications in your workplace. If most of the members of your entry level ranks are women (the banking industry may be a good example of this), based on the implications of this study, it may be less likely that they will rise up through the ranks of the organization to fill leadership positions. And, in fact, the banking industry is led predominantly by men.</p><p> Are you inadvertently creating a climate of insecurity among female members of your workforce? Be inclusive!</p>",

Be clear about your strengths; what do you like to do, how do you like to do it, and what do you get out of doing it&ndash;i.e. what are the motivations behind your strengths? </strong></p><p> As many of our readers know, we favor memories of &ldquo;flow&rdquo; as a way to clarify our interests, working style and motivational needs. Our flow memories recall times when we were so engaged in tasks that we lost all track of clock time and entered a state of &ldquo;timeless time&rdquo;.</p><p> Our objective is to create a psychological base by examining how and when we have thrived, in order to give us the confidence and momentum to address our future. We can start by remembering two or three situations where we were performing at our best, using all our talents and were so involved in what we were doing that we lost all sense of time. Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you with? Were you directing the effort or were you part of a team responding to a challenge? Or were you singularly addressing and resolving a problem?</p><p> These &ldquo;memory exercises&rdquo; will give you important insights regarding our &ldquo;motivational needs.&rdquo; From these memories, you can also deconstruct what your interests are and your style for pursuing them. If you want to go even deeper, you can also use an in-depth &ldquo;personality profile,&rdquo; such as the Birkman Method, available through Birkman International (800 215 2760).</p><p> <strong>  2.  Having clarified our strengths, we can use them in the direction of a Vision for our future. Quoting Frederic Hudson, from LifeLaunch: A Passionate Guide to the Rest of Your Life (The Hudson Institute Press): </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Whenever you consult your life&rsquo;s compass within you, it points toward the current purpose&hellip;Your values, deep energy, and passionate destinations are all wrapped up into one profound sense of purpose, pulling you ahead into more of yourself, through the chapters of your life. That sense of purpose is like a vibrant channel, an illuminated path, a personal calling.&rdquo;</p><p> As John and I have worked with people in transition we have found that peoples&rsquo; Vision statements for themselves are actually supported by three systems that we have identified as:</p><p> STRUCTURE</p><p> COMMUNITY</p><p> PURPOSE</p><p> Structure is the way we organize our lives to use our strengths. For example, I wake up each morning filled with energy but frequently without a clear direction. I have found that if I work out each morning for about an hour my energy is still high but I am able to direct myself more easily into channels. This structure for my day helps me organize my life into periods of high energy and creativity, lower energy and contemplative time, and finally winding down and restorative time.</p><p> In addition, structure works as a way to organize larger blocks of time: by the day, the week, the year. We can predict Thanksgiving and seasonal holidays as markers, for example, punctuating the year . Similarly, structure helps us look at our life plans, morphing from post-collegiate to mid-career to post career with a sense of time passing and, at its best, a sense of ripening. So, as a component of vision, structure supports our sense of timeliness: is this the moment in my life to choose a transition and how can I plan the structure of my life to support it? What changes will I have to make to organize my day? Or my year?</p><p> Community is our support system for our social needs: how do we organize recognition for goals? Who shares our world view? Or our desire to get a new traffic light at the corner? A community responds to our need for contact, that as social creatures, our strengths thrive when we have others to share with. So when we think about leveraging our strengths, we consider places and people who mirror back to us shared ideas, values and social abilites.</p><p> Purpose supports our place in the world. Why are we here, why do we do what we do? Purpose can have a theological quality ( God&rsquo;s will) or a pragmatic one ( I wish to give my children benefits I didn&rsquo;t have). Or both. At its most fulfilling, we find a way to answer the question: what is the meaning of my life? How will my stay on earth make a difference?</p><p> As we combine structure, community and purpose, we create a support system for our vision&ndash; where, how and why do we wish to live? Concretely, are there things we wish to accomplish&ndash; a legacy&ndash;as a marker to our lives? What are our social needs and how will they be met? As we think about exploring our strengths without the fettering of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; what new opportunities can we envision? Does our sense of purpose gain clarity and force.</p><p> <strong>  3.  In our research on transition, we have found that a key component of leveraging strengths lies in creating workable time schedules. </strong></p><p>  As we explore in Your Retirement, Your Way, (McGraw-Hill,2006), time can be structured so that it aids our meeting our dreams, or &ldquo;dreams with deadlines&rdquo;, as John calls them. So, writing as a cheerleader, we have found that clarifying our purpose, supporting ourselves through a social community and structuring ourselves through a renewed sense of purpose allows us to create effectively, diminishing our anxious need to perfect ourselves first. In addition, setting timelines encourages a participation in our transitions as we effectively create workable goals.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> You spend the majority of your time at work solving problems. <br/>  </h3><p> It makes sense then that your long term career success and happiness depend on knowing &mdash; and selecting roles that focus on &mdash; the type of problems you enjoy the most. Use that to guide your career and you will be one of &ldquo;the lucky ones&rdquo; who love their work. <br/> <br/> The opposite is also true.</p><p> I see this over and over again coaching execs and aspiring leaders: Each of us is pulled toward one or two categories of problems, and prefers to avoid the others.</p><p> For example, some people love solving the problems of starting new things. Others seek out the issues of growing something from small to large. Still others prefer to fix big problems or turn around something failing, and get bored once that&rsquo;s done. Finally there are the Steady Eddies who are happy solving the incremental issues to keep things on track.</p><p> Which one or two is/are the most you? It&rsquo;s simple to figure out: Look back on the happiest times in your career or life, and the least happy times, and you will see your own pattern.</p><p> If, for example, you are a &ldquo;starter/builder&rdquo; in a &ldquo;fixer/runner&rdquo; role, things are going to be painful for you and the organization. If you&rsquo;re a starter/builder in a startup situation you&rsquo;re going to be in the zone. <br/> <br/> Similarly, it&rsquo;s helpful to understand that the types of problems an organization NEEDS solved vary with business cycles and level of maturity of the enterprise. A turnaround situation is simply not well served with a starter/builder at the helm. There needs to be a match.</p><p> That&rsquo;s not to say a fixer can&rsquo;t be a starter and vice versa &mdash; over time our careers will call for every one of these things. Yet to be at your best and do your best work consistently, you need to understand your natural preferences and align / realign with a matching job or organizational need.</p><h3> Looking at the Four Preferences <br/>  </h3><p> As you consider each of these preferences, ask yourself: Which one or two is/are the most &ldquo;you&rdquo; at this point in your life? Which of the challenges give you your biggest thrill, or sense of fulfillment? Which would you rather avoid? Which would you like to spend the majority of your time doing? Are you doing that now? If not, what needs to happen?</p><p> <strong>  1. The &ldquo;Starter&rdquo; loves the challenges of the blank whiteboard </strong></p><p> S/he sees it as an invitation to innovation, invention or creation, and will take the steps needed to turn that clear vision into action. They probably have more than ten domain names, patents, or trademarks at the ready. They have the soul of an entrepreneur/ instigator and the energy and skills to go with it. Once it&rsquo;s off the ground, interest tends to move on to the next big idea.</p><p> <strong>  2. The &ldquo;Builder&rdquo; loves the challenges of growing something from formative to fruitful </strong></p><p> S/he will be at peace when the dials of volumes, sales or other growth metrics are spinning up - with their hands on the wheels. They love applying cleverness and skill to balancing resources versus constraints versus high demand, and are happiest when that results in the &ldquo;great to have&rdquo; problems of significant growth. Over time, as the growth line inevitably begins to flatten, the Builder will be ready for a change.</p><p> <strong>  3. The &ldquo;Fixer&rdquo; loves the challenges of something or someone in need, and the promise of making a big difference. </strong></p><p> S/he wants to get into gnarly issues &mdash; the tougher the better. They believe in their ability to instigate change, even when others see a wall or puzzle of human or organizational nature. They are happiest when applying their smarts and skills to make a big impact that leads to lasting change. Once done with the remarkable feat, it&rsquo;s time for the next new challenge.</p><p> <strong>  4. The &ldquo;Runner&rdquo; loves the challenges of the long game </strong></p><p> S/he enjoys ongoing responsibility through thick and thin, ever keeping a steady hand on the tiller. They are less likely to want to change things significantly over a short period of time, but want to make more subtle adjustments that keep things on track. They see the long haul responsibility not as a burden, but as a blessing.</p><p> Not only is it critical for a leader or executive to know themselves, but it&rsquo;s also important to understand your team, and anyone you may hire.</p><p> The secret here is that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;luck&rdquo; that guides us into doing the work we love - it&rsquo;s simply knowing ourselves, and making choices that turn that knowledge into a direction that fits us.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> In our every day life we ask favors of others, and for most this is routine. <br/>  </h3><p> But for some reason, businesspeople and job seekers appear to freeze up when their need arises. The main problem is the fear of being seen in a less than favorable light.</p><p> On the other side of the table, problems arise when companies request an RFP or an entrepreneur requests a ballpark estimate for services. Many service providers are known to make their process difficult on a number of levels. This dissuades the requesting party from selecting that supplier.</p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> This week, I had reason to request estimates from people providing one particular service. Upon receipt of some of the messages, my advice of &ldquo;Make it easy for the client to say yes!&rdquo; immediately came to mind.</p><p> Responses received:</p><li> The first message was almost impossible to understand, and included a statement saying my project would be on the back burner for a couple of weeks.</li><li> One message only concentrated on their fee to be collected without showing any interest in my project</li><li> The last message communicated immediate interest in my project, a reasonable fee, and a timeline by when it could be completed.</li><p> No doubt you can guess which service provider I chose!</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> It would be rare for anyone to win 100% of the business for which they compete. The best learning lessons come to those willing to examine their own lost business. Review how you presented your story, answered the prospects&rsquo; questions, and how the information requested was delivered. Then answer these questions:</p><li> Did you tailor your information to their interests?</li><li> Is your system easy to understand as well as easy to implement?</li><li> Did you show genuine interest in what your prospects were trying to achieve?</li><p> Given recognition of which supplier I selected, think about all you do. What might be changed in the future to earn improved results? Remember, the initial interactions provide insight as to the customer service experience one might expect after the sale is made.</p><h3> Here are 10 sales tips for winning more business:  <br/>  </h3><li> Simplify as much of your communication as possible.</li><li> Ensure your communication is clear and concise.</li><li> Before providing an estimate, research the company and the project in question.</li><li> Any detail you find unclear in the request, ask for clarification.</li><li> Should a detail appear to be unimportant to you, ask why it is important to them.</li><li> Communicate how you work and why it will be beneficial for the client.</li><li> Provide an outline of everything to be included in your delivery</li><li> Provide a timeline of milestones if a lengthy project or an end date for a simple one.</li><li> Convey how you accept payment in terms of payment service as well as deposit.</li><li> Ask your prospect when they would like to begin &ndash; and thank your new client!</li>",

    "content": "<p> It can take a while for new writers to figure out what does and doesn&rsquo;t work. Even though every writer is different, we&rsquo;ve found a few success tips and tricks that are pretty universal.</p><p> Here are some rituals and daily practices to help you produce better copy:</p><h3> 1) Rethink your desk setup <br/>  </h3><p> The best is a clean desk. The next-best desk is &ldquo;organized chaos.&rdquo; Piles of folded paper and coffee cups, however, are a creativity killer for most writers because they distract from the task at hand.</p><h3> 2) Buy at least one good dictionary <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re in Canada, the Oxford Canadian Dictionary is ideal. For U.S. writers, the Merriam-Webster is the way to go. A good thesaurus can come in handy &ndash; just make sure that you don&rsquo;t open it until the editing process.</p><h3> 3) Take breaks <br/>  </h3><p> There&rsquo;s a whole cohort of copywriters out there &ndash; some of the best &ndash; who will write for only 33 minutes before getting up and taking a break. They say that it&rsquo;s the best way to stay fresh for longer. Experiment with this idea and let us know what you think.</p><h3> 4) Write first <br/>  </h3><p> Just like the savings mantra &ldquo;Pay yourself first,&rdquo; writers should write for themselves first. Emails can wait. What&rsquo;s most important is that you get an hour or two of focused, project-based writing done before distractions take over your day.</p><h3> 5) Carry a note pad/note app <br/>  </h3><p> Always be ready to write. Some people keep a Moleskin or waiter&rsquo;s notepad in their pocket, while other people use note-taking apps (like Google Keep) on their phone. This little adjustment can pay great dividends over the long term.</p><h3> 6) Gather your facts <br/>  </h3><p> Read everything you can beforehand, take notes, highlight key points and anything else you need to do. That way, your writing time is focused on writing, not researching.</p><h3> 7) Edit before you send <br/>  </h3><p> Always take the time to edit your work before sending it out for review. Some writers only need one round of edits, while other will take five passes or more at their copy. If you&rsquo;re so familiar with the copy that you might miss typos, get someone else to take a look.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Let me introduce you to two business owners: Kim Novak owns the very cool Knitting Board, which creates wooden looms for crafters, while the other is a friend who just opened an exciting a new restaurant in New York. <br/>  </h3><p> Two very different enterprises, but both individuals have found that &rdquo;keep it simple stupid&rdquo; can be the foundation for a successful and thriving business.  </p><p> While both have some exciting marketing and product components, it is the basics that are making them winners in their market.</p><p> First, each brings a real zest and zeal for the business. And, with that, comes a great deal of experience and commitment, because they really love, love, love what they do. They&rsquo;re eager to keep learning, so they can keep their clients updated on all the latest trends. They take time each day to focus on &ldquo;thinking.&rdquo; Just thinking. With the &ldquo;attractive distractions&rdquo; in our day, we forget to just &ldquo;think.&rdquo; The end result? A better business.</p><p> While that&rsquo;s excellent business sense right there, they go the next step: they both understand and accept their weaknesses. </p><p> Like most creatives, they&rsquo;re not proficient with the finances, so, they partnered with the proper staff to manage the books and get explanations of all financial terms and formulas.</p><p> They also follow the tried and true business formula that 80% of sales and profits are driven by 20% of customers, aka, the &ldquo;80/20 rule.&rdquo; The restaurant offers a limited menu that can change every day, but with proven dishes that the kitchen staff can create effortlessly. Similarly, the Knitting Board has a limited (but complete) selection of looms, and they keep things lively by highlighting the newest and top selling items.</p><p> Both realize the importance of being seen by their staff, and therefore stay visible and engaged in the everyday business operations. At the restaurant, one oversees the kitchen and virtually every order, while her partners and management team check in on the diners, ready to assist whenever a problem arises. Kim keeps an eye on every marketing effort and has a part-time staff who continue developing new patterns, creating new blogs, and marketing materials.</p><p> Each one sees mistakes as an opportunity to learn, and adapt. For instance, the restaurant experienced numerous delays in its opening, but restructured the financing and menus in order to work with the new time frame. Meanwhile, Kim continues to search for new markets, and is now working on new products and programs to attract customers from Europe and beyond.</p><p> Both entrepreneurs continue to focus on excellence, and how to achieve it. They understand Ben Franklin&rsquo;s adage: &ldquo;A great idea without execution is hallucination.&rdquo; The restaurant uses the best and freshest ingredients, and the Knitting Board focuses on high quality wooden looms versus the cheaper, and easy to break, plastic ones. Yes, both could cut corners with using a lower quality product, but, in the end, both the customer and the business suffer.</p><p> These two examples illustrate how operating a successful business is not really brain surgery, but, rather, means following a few simple principles. And, if you love what you do, have the right staff, offer a quality product, and delegate to the experts, you have the foundation for a simply wonderful business.</p>",

What happens when you are driving along a busy freeway going 60 miles per hour (or 110 kilometers per hour in Canada) and you want to slow down to 30 miles per hour ( or 60 kilometers per hour in Canada)?</p><p> It is more stressful driving at half the speed than full speed. You eventually have to get completely off the freeway as you are putting yourself and everyone else at risk. The financial business operates on the same principal. Slowing down is harder and more stressful than going full speed.</p><h3> What are your key practice management processes? <br/>  </h3><p> The advisors who have more processes are more successful than the advisors that lack key processes. But which processes are critical to your business success? In researching practice management for financial advisors, I wanted to find strategies to help them. I came across some startling facts about advisors and practice management.</p><li> 85% of advisors have NO formal client feedback system or process</li><li> 75% of advisors have NO formal definition of ideal client</li><li> 73% of advisors have NO written service agreement or processes</li><li> 43% of advisors have NO documented unique value proposition</li><p> [Source USA FPA Research and Practice Institute study - Future of Practice Management -December 2013]</p><h3> What is holding you back? <br/>  </h3><p> Human behavior holds advisors back from accomplishing their goals. It is the same thing that holds clients back from achieving their financial goals. Advisors&rsquo; behavior affects their practice. When advisors follow their natural instincts or habits, they tend to apply faulty reasoning without research. Should I go 100% fee based? What does the research say? Why do I need a comprehensive value proposition, I know a lot of advisors that do not have one? What questions keep you from growing your business? How many client relationships can you handle in one year? What is your ideal capacity? I know that most people rationalize business decisions based on facts, but you should implement business decisions based on feelings. This is where practice management needs to tap into your subconscious motivations.</p><h3> What are your subconscious motivations? <br/>  </h3><p> Do you want more time off? Do you see tremendous opportunities you want to capture in a certain market? Build a dream home? What is important to you in your practice? What are your internal and external motivators? Why do you do the things you do? What are you passionate about? What is the story you want to tell the world every day? What drives you, motivates you and invigorates you more than anything else? What is your why?</p><p> Top advisors have one thing above all other advisors, clarity.</p><p> Darren Hardy of Success magazine shares and interesting story. (www.success.com) Imagine a race between three people to complete a 1,000-piece puzzle.</p><p> Person No. 1 was given one with the picture on the box. <br/> Person No. 2 was given the box with no picture on it. <br/> Person No. 3 was given a box with the wrong picture on it. <br/> Who is going to win? <br/> Exactly, person No. 1.</p><p> You need a clear picture (vision) to complete the puzzle of your life.</p><p> Envision that you have already accomplished your most important goal for your business today. How does that make you feel? Act as if it has already been done. The message is clear, the best advisors spend more time on servicing clients BECAUSE they have invested the time and energy to put their processes in place.</p>",

    "title": "Lawmakers May Target Some Roth IRA Tax Benefits",
    "link": "lawmakers-may-target-some-roth-ira-tax-benefits",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The President has fired the first warning shot indicating that politicians are eying the tax advantages of the Roth IRA. For years I&rsquo;ve strongly encouraged maximum funding of Roth IRAs and 401(k)s. Clients have sometimes expressed concern that politicians would someday retroactively change the rules and strip the plans of their tax advantages. I&rsquo;ve seen that concern as a possibility (for example, in 2008  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/weekly-column/does-uncle-sam-want-your-ira\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Argentina confiscated the assets in IRAs  </a> and 401(k)s and replaced them with less than desirable Argentinian Government Bonds), but not much of a probability.</p><h3> With the introduction of the President&rsquo;s 2016 budget, the probability of losing some Roth IRA tax benefits has increased.</h3><p> <br/> Each February the President submits a budget to Congress which is about far more than spending requests. It also contains scores of proposed changes to existing tax laws. One such proposal in the current budget would eliminate two tax advantages of the Roth IRA.</p><p> <strong>  The first change would require required minimum distributions (RMDs) for Roth IRAs as well as traditional IRAs. </strong></p><p> Currently, one of the benefits of a Roth IRA is not having to take RMDs. At age 70 1/2, owners of traditional IRAs are required withdraw a certain percentage annually, often around 4%. They must pay the tax due and, if they don&rsquo;t need the funds for living expenses, must invest the remainder in a taxable account. The RMD denies them the option of leaving the money in the tax-deferred environment of the IRA and further compounding.</p><p> Under the President&rsquo;s proposal, owners of Roth IRAs will need to start withdrawing funds annually at age 70 1/2. While there won&rsquo;t be any taxes due because contributions to Roths are post-tax, it will remove the funds from the tax-free environment, decreasing future returns by up to 40%. That&rsquo;s a big deal.</p><p> <strong>  The second proposed change would eliminate tax-deferred inheritance of IRAs (sometimes called &ldquo;stretch IRAs) for anyone except spouses. </strong> All other inherited IRAs would need to be dissolved and the funds distributed and taxed within five years after death. This will really impact Baby Boomers counting on their parents&rsquo; IRAs to assist them with their own retirement needs.</p><p> The budget proposals also would end Roth conversions to any after-tax IRAs, limiting them to IRAs where the contributions were before taxes. This would prohibit taxpayers with earnings above the traditional and Roth IRA threshold from making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA and then doing a Roth conversion.</p><p> <strong>  The final proposal would limit new IRA contributions for total retirement savings totaling over $3.4 million. </strong> This includes the aggregate total of IRAs, 401(k)s, and any other pension plan balances. Once the total reaches $3.4 million at the end of the tax year, no new contributions are possible.</p><p> To many Americans, this looks like a cap they will never see in their lifetime. Yet consider what $3.4 million will be worth in purchasing power 40 years from now, when today&rsquo;s 30-year-olds will have to start RMDs. If inflation maintains its historical average of 3%, in 40 years $3.4 million will have the purchasing power of just over $1 million today. If someone wants to be assured they will never run out of money in retirement, $1 million only provides $30,000 a year of retirement income. Capping IRA growth is another big deal.</p><p> These are a few of the tax changes proposed by the President&rsquo;s budget. The chances for any to become law in 2016 are remote, given that Congress is currently controlled by Republicans. However, the proposals do signal the current thinking of lawmakers. In considering their retirement planning, taxpayers would be advised to pay attention to such signals.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Yields on traditionally safe fixed income assets have been collapsing across the world. US ten-year bond yields are below 2%. Japan recently  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/54c77474-df7f-11e5-b072-006d8d362ba3.html#axzz42QKNd43V\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   sold  </a> </u>  new ten-year bonds with a negative yield (-0.02%) for the first time, following Switzerland (which did the same last year) across the financial rubicon. Yes, you now have to pay the Japanese government for the privilege of lending them money. German ten-year bond yields offered a measly 0.11% at the end of February.</p><p> Corporate bonds offer no respite to an investor in search of yield. As the next chart illustrates, yields on AAA and AA U.S. corporate bonds have also collapsed since the end of the Great Recession. Effective yields on U.S. Corporate AAA bonds averaged 2.5% between 2010 and 2015, compared to 4.8% during the six years prior to the last recession (2002 through 2007).</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/US-corporate-bond-yields.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"US corporate bond yields\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/US-corporate-bond-yields.png\"/> </a></p><h3> <strong>  So what is an investor who is hunting for yield to do? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investing in higher yielding corporate bonds (junk bonds) is significantly more riskier than their higher-rated counterparts. The spread between quality and junk yields has  <a href=\"https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  widened considerably </a>  thanks to the dominance of energy companies in the high yield sector.</p><p> At the same time, investors have become increasingly concerned about interest rate risk, especially concerns over bond prices plummeting as yields begin to rise from all-time lows. This was brought to the forefront during the taper-tantrum that started in May 2013, when the former chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, suggested the Fed might begin to taper their bond-buying stimulus program. Fixed income volatility rose significantly as the yield on the ten-year bond climbed from 1.66 on May 1st to 3.04 by December 31st, 2013. Yet, yields have fallen since then, despite the Fed ending its quantitative easing program and even increasing the short-term rate in December 2015 for the first time in a decade. We discussed a few reasons behind falling yields in a prior  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/are-higher-interest-rates-inevitable/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  post </a> .</p><h3> <strong>  Alternative Income </strong></h3><p> <br/> The dual concerns over low yields and interest rate risk has led investors to look for alternative sources of income that are uncorrelated with traditional fixed income assets. These include high dividend paying stocks in the U.S. and abroad, real-estate investment trusts (REITs) and master-limited partnerships (MLPs).</p><p> The financial industry has responded to this siren call for income with a raft of  <u>  <a href=\"http://dailyalts.com/list-of-new-liquid-alternative-funds-launched-in-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   new funds  </a> </u>  that focus on building income from alternative sources. Investment strategies that use diversified sources of yield are certainly not a new phenomena but the rise in popularity of non-traditional income sources is more recent. We believe a simple methodology that evaluates these within the context of an investor who would otherwise be looking for income from a traditionally safe fixed income vehicle.</p><p> We consider two funds, a mutual fund and an ETF, with long track records (&gt; 3 years) and with the stated goal of generating income from diversified sources.</p><p> The first is  <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing/products/227543/blackrock-multi-asset-income-class-a-fund\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blackrock&rsquo;s Multi-Asset Income mutual fund  </u>    </a> (ticker: BAICX), which tactically manages a portfolio of equities, fixed income and non-traditional sources of income like REITs, MLPs, preferred stocks and covered calls. The goal is to provide higher income with lower volatility. The fund has more than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/baicx/quote.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $12 billion  </a> </u>  in assets with an expense ratio of 0.80% and a not insignificant upfront load of 5.25%.</p><p> The second is  <u>  Guggenheim&rsquo;s Multi-Asset Income ETF </u>  (ticker: CVY), which follows a proprietary model that invests in multiple high yielding asset classes including stocks, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and preferred stocks. The ETF has more than  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/cvy/quote.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $450 million  </a> </u>  in assets with an expense ratio of 0.83%.</p><p> We analyze these funds over the four-year period between 2012 and 2015, compared to similar investments in the iShares 7-10 year treasury bond ETF (ticker: IEF, expense ratio: 0.15%) and the SPDR Barclays high yield bond ETF (ticker: JNK, expense ratio: 0.40%), two proxies of traditional fixed income funds. Also included is the iShares select dividend ETF (ticker: DVY, expense ratio: 0.39%) as a proxy for a basket of high dividend paying stocks.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s walk through three questions we would ask of an alternative income manager.</p><h3> <strong>  How much yield can I expect? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The obvious question but consider why the answer may not be as simple as it may seem.</p><p> When you purchase a 10-year U.S. treasury bond, the payout is predictable, at least for the next ten years. For example, a 10-year bond purchased at auction in December 2010 had a yield (&ldquo;coupon rate&rdquo;) of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/press_auctionresults.htm\" target=\"_blank\">   3.26%  </a> </u> . That means the bond pays $3,260.00 annually for every $100,000 of principal, and this does not change, at least until the bond matures and the principal has to be re-invested.</p><p> However, a couple of challenges crop up when looking at the stated yield for a fund:</p><li> They are always backward looking and may not tell you how much yield you will exactly receive in the future.</li><li> The stated yield is typically the most recent yield and does not tell you anything about how it varied over the years. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Take the case of our two example alternative income funds. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/fact-sheet/oef-multi-asset-income-fund-fact-sheet.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   factsheet  </a> </u>  for the BlackRock income fund tells us that the &rsquo;30-day SEC yield&rsquo; is 4.66% as of 02/29/16. What does this mean? The  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/sec_yield.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   30-day SEC yield  </a> </u>  is a standardized calculation of yield introduced by the SEC to help investors compare &ldquo;apples-to-apples&rdquo; and eliminate misleading performance and income claims. The details of the calculation are included at the end of this post, but suffice to say, the measure tells us what the fund would yield if it continued to distribute income exactly as it did over the past thirty days. The formula for the 30-day SEC yield includes both the dividend as well as the fund&rsquo;s NAV (close price) at the end of the period, both of which vary considerably from one month to another. So this measure gives you an incomplete story.</p><p> Guggenheim  <u>  reports </u>  a different measure for its multi-asset income ETF &ndash; the &rsquo;12 month yield&rsquo; &ndash; which stood at 5.91% as of 03/04/2016. This measure is calculated by adding all the interest and dividend payments over the last twelve months and dividing by the fund&rsquo;s NAV (close price) on the as-of date. It tells us how much income to expectif dividend payments remain exactly the same going forward. Once again, the problem is that the dividend varies quite significantly from one twelve month period to another. The fund&rsquo;s NAV varies as well. For example, the 12 month yield as of 02/29/2016 would have been calculated as 6.17%, which is different from 5.91% only because the denominator (NAV) changed.</p><p> It is curious that you always see historical returns listed for each calendar year but you hardly ever see the same for dividend yields. Morningstar  <u>  <a href=\"http://etfs.morningstar.com/distribution?t=CVY&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lists  </a> </u>  the annual dividend paid out in the case of ETFs but not yield. While historical yields will not precisely tell you how much yield to expect in the future, it will show you how a fund&rsquo;s yield varied in the past. Simply looking at a single stated yield number for a fund is akin to looking at just the average historical return for the fund, or perhaps more accurately, the return over the past year.</p><p> Below we show historical annual dividend yields for our two alternative income funds, as well as the treasury and high yield bond ETFs, between 2012 and 2015. Note that the obvious disclaimer that applies to return measures &ndash;past performance is not indicative of future results &ndash; should apply for historical dividend yields as well.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/historical-annual-dividend-yields1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"historical annual dividend yields1\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/historical-annual-dividend-yields1.png\"/></a><br/>Historical annual dividend yields. Dividend and price data were obtained from <u> <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yahoo! Finance </a></u>. <br/> <p> In each case we calculated yield by adding all distributed income for the fund over an entire calendar year and dividing by the fund&rsquo;s NAV (close price) on the last trading day of the previous year. For example, the 4.74% yield for the BlackRock income fund in 2015 indicates that you would have received $4,740 in income for every $100,000 invested in this fund on 12/31/2014.</p><p> The table clearly illustrates how the yield for each fund changed over the years, with the two alternative income funds exhibiting a greater range. This is something that does not come across on any of their factsheets, which typically state a single number.</p><h3> <strong>  How often is the dividend paid and how do payouts fluctuate? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Most investors searching for an income product probably require dividend payouts more than once a year and so it helps to know the payout schedule of an income fund. The next table shows how often the five income funds paid out dividends between 2012 and 2015.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dividend-payout-schedule1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"dividend payout schedule1\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dividend-payout-schedule1.png\"/></a><br/>Dividend payout schedule between 2012 and 2015. Dividend data was obtained from <u> <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yahoo! Finance </a></u>.<br/> <p> At the same time, an income seeker should also know how consistent the dividends have been. Frequently, the payout from one period to another varies quite sharply. An investor who is reliant on a specific quarterly payout is presumably not going to be pleased by large fluctuations in their income.</p><p> To get an idea of how payouts vary from quarter to quarter, we calculated the average quarterly yield for each of the four income funds and used standard deviation as a measure of variation. These statistics, along with the minimum and maximum quarterly yields during the four-year period 2012-2015, are shown below.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/historical-quarterly-dividend-yields1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"historical quarterly dividend yields1\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/historical-quarterly-dividend-yields1.png\"/></a><br/>Quarterly dividend payout statistics between 2012 and 2015. Dividend and price data were obtained from <u> <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yahoo! Finance </a></u>. Note that the quarterly yields are not annualized.<br/> <p> The yield in each quarter is calculated by adding all the income distributed by the fund over an entire quarter and dividing by the fund&rsquo;s NAV (close price) on the last trading day of the previous year.</p><p> The yield clearly varies quite significantly from one quarter to the next. For example, the average quarterly yield on Guggenheim&rsquo;s income ETF was 1.39%, i.e. $1,390 paid out on average per quarter for every $100,000 invested at the beginning of the year. However, the standard deviation is 0.22%, or $220 for every $100,000 invested. This is not insignificant, especially around an average payout of $1,390. In fact, an investor may have received a quarterly payout as low as $1,120 (1.12% of $100,000) to one as high as $1,970 (1.97% of $100,000) between 2012 and 2015. The variation is even larger for BlackRock&rsquo;s income fund and the high-yield bond ETF. Interestingly, the variation is lowest for the dividend equity ETF (DVY).</p><p> The historical variation of quarterly, or even monthly, payouts would be helpful to an investor who may be dependent on a consistent stream of income generated by the investment.</p><h3> <strong>  What happens to my principal? </strong></h3><p> <br/> An investor who invests $100,000 in a 10-year bond at auction will receive the same principal at the end of the ten year period (in nominal terms). This is not necessarily going to be the case when you use a mutual fund or an ETF to generate income.</p><p> We saw above that yields on the two alternative funds, as well as the high yield fund, are significantly higher than that of the treasury bond or equity dividend ETFs. Yet it does not give you the entire story of your original investment. In other words, we need to see performance that includes the yield as well as any capital appreciation.</p><p> The wealth index chart below shows how $100,000 invested in each of the four funds at the end of 2011 would have performed over the next four years, after expenses and any load fees.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wealth-index-with-reinvested-dividends1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"wealth-index with reinvested dividends1\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wealth-index-with-reinvested-dividends1.png\"/></a><br/>Wealth index showing growth of $100,000 invested on 12/31/2011. Monthly return data for the five funds were obtained from Zephyr StyleAdvisor.<br/> <p> The period we consider here has been an outstanding one for equities in particular and it shows, with the equity dividend ETF (DVY) out-performing by far when you include both yields and capital appreciation. The following table shows summary statistics for the five funds between 2012 and 2015. The maximum drawdown number is the drawdown in portfolio value from peak-to-trough.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/summary-stats-reinvested-dividends2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"summary stats reinvested dividends2\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/summary-stats-reinvested-dividends2.png\"/></a><br/>Summary statistics for the period Jan 2012 &ndash; Dec 2015. Monthly return data for the five funds were obtained from Zephyr StyleAdvisor.<br/> <p> Guggenheim&rsquo;s income ETF is the most volatile of the five, with a significant drawdown close to 24%. As the wealth index chart shows, an investment in the ETF would have lost considerable value after August 2014 thanks to its MLP positions, which were clobbered by falling energy prices. The equity dividend ETF out-performs even as it was less volatile than the Guggenheim ETF. BlackRock&rsquo;s income fund is the next best performer, with slightly less volatility and lower drawdown than even the treasury bond ETF.</p><p> While looking at overall performance measures is crucial to understanding what would have happened to your original investment, there is an additional point to consider. These measures almost always assume that dividends are re-invested (as we did above). However, an investor who seeks income is probably not going to be re-investing that income back into the fund.</p><p> So let&rsquo;s take a look at what would have happened to a principal investment of $100,000 in each of our five funds between 2012 and 2015. Just capital appreciation, no dividends.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wealth-index-with-no-dividend-reinvesting1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"wealth-index with no dividend reinvesting1\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wealth-index-with-no-dividend-reinvesting1.png\"/></a><br/>Wealth index showing growth of $100,000 invested on 12/31/2011, excluding dividends. Monthly price data for the five funds were obtained from <u> <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yahoo! Finance </a></u>. <br/> <p> With the exception of the dividend equity and treasury bond ETFs, your principal would have been worth less than its starting value of $100,000. While the BlackRock fund fell less than 1%, the principal would have sunk more than 10% with both the Guggenheim and high yield funds.</p><p> The next table shows summary statistics for the principal, with no dividend re-investment. The overall dividend yield on the original investment over four years is also shown in the last column.</p><a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/summary-stats-no-dividend-reinvesment1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"summary stats - no dividend reinvesment1\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/summary-stats-no-dividend-reinvesment1.png\"/></a><br/>Summary statistics for the period Jan 2012 &ndash; Dec 2015 (price only). Monthly price data for the five funds were obtained from <u> <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yahoo! Finance </a></u>. <br/> <p> Compared to the earlier results which included re-invested dividends, volatility rises only slightly for all the five funds but the maximum drawdown value in each case is clearly larger. In the case of the BlackRock fund, the maximum drawdown of the principal is close to -10%, compared to less than 5% when we included dividend re-investment. The difference is even more stark for Guggenheim&rsquo;s ETF, for which the principal experiences a drawdown of more than 30%, compared to a 24% maximum drawdown when dividends are re-invested.</p><p> Of course, it makes sense to add the total dividends you received over the entire period to the final value of your principal for a true measure of return. For example, the total yield for the BlackRock fund is 20.17%, which means you would have received $20,170 over four years on an original $100,000 investment. Adding this to the market value of the principal at the end of 2015, $99,388, gets you to $119,558 &ndash; for an overall return of 19.56% over the four years (less than the 20.50% you would have received if you re-invested dividends).</p><p> Yet, if an investor who regularly cashes out their dividend looks into their account, all they see is the current market value of their original principal investment. This is the sum of money available to them if they were to switch to another investment.</p><p> Circling back to the top of this post, investors are scrambling for higher yielding investment vehicles thanks to a low interest rate environment and concerns over the possibility of bond prices falling significantly if rates increase. At the same time, we highlight why it is important to dig a little deeper into the stated yield numbers for an investment. It is also critical to understand what may happen to your principal as you try and find income, balancing the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing/literature/investor-guide/oef-multi-asset-income-investor-guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   trade-off  </a> </u>  between higher yield and more risk.</p><p> In a future post we will consider a simple quantitative approach to building a tactical income strategy using several diversified sources of yield.</p><p> &mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>Additional notes:1. All performance measures and dividend yields are after expenses. The 5.25% upfront load for the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income fund (BAICX) is also taken into account.<br/>2. One thing we did not discuss in the section about dividend yields is the fact that sometimes mutual funds pay out short-term capital gains, which we treated as income above. For example, the BlackRock multi-asset income fund paid out $0.0262 per share as short-term capital gains on 12/23/2015, which would have a different tax treatment than regular dividend income.<br/>3. <u> <a href=\"http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/mutual-fundsetfs/30-day-annualized-yield-832\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Calculation of 30-day SEC yield </a></u>",

My phone rang at 8:00 a.m. and Susan&rsquo;s voice was even more desperate than before. &ldquo;I think we have to cancel.&rdquo; She sounded like she was almost in tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull stuff together all week, and I can&rsquo;t find what you need. I don&rsquo;t know where to start.&rdquo; I felt terrible. I realized I&rsquo;d given Susan an assignment she was wholly unprepared to complete. She was living the nightmare.</p><p> When it comes to financial planning, the challenge of getting organized is as common as nightmares themselves. And unfortunately, it keeps people who need help as far away from a financial advisor as they can get. If you&rsquo;re in the same boat as Susan, you might be thinking: &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t even organize my finances, how can I ever hand it over to an advisor?&rdquo; Or worse: &ldquo;Any advisor will think I&rsquo;m completely incompetent if they see what a mess I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo; So the fear of not being able to do it &ldquo;right&rdquo; and the fear of being judged stands in the way of getting help. Taking that first step can feel like climbing Mount Everest (including the lack of oxygen!), but knowing these facts can help:</p><h3> Your finances are complicated.</h3><p> <br/> You may feel they shouldn&rsquo;t be, but they are. And unless you&rsquo;re a financial planner yourself, you may not even know what all the pieces of the puzzle are&mdash;much less where they are.ideally in a concise, single-page overview) but you also don&rsquo;t have to worry about the unknown any longer.</p><h3> Procrastination is a killer.</h3><p> <br/> As complex as your finances may feel today, the longer you wait to get help, the more complicated and out of control they&rsquo;re likely to become. Don&rsquo;t wait to clean out your files, pay off your debt, or put money in the bank before getting help. Woody Allen&rsquo;s Alvy Singer stopped doing his homework was because:  <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5U1-OmAICpU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;The universe is expanding!...and someday it will break apart and that will be the end of everything&hellip;so what&rsquo;s the point?!&rdquo;  </a> </u>  And while I believe there is a point, he&rsquo;s right: your universe is expanding. Next year you&rsquo;ll have more assets (hopefully), more financial needs, and more complexity. Ten years from now, your challenges will be that much greater. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate. Time is of the essence!</p><h3> The older you are, the more help you may need.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, finances often get more complicated with age, but there&rsquo;s a bigger issue that comes with getting older. Unfortunately, the ability to understand and analyze your finances decreases with age. Even if you&rsquo;ve always managed your finances in the past, as you (or your spouse) age, the task will inevitably become more challenging, and mistakes and misjudgments can happen more and more. It&rsquo;s never easy to recognize changes in your abilities, but if managing your finances is getting harder, it&rsquo;s time to ask for help.</p><h3> There are only three prerequisites. (Hint: Being organized isn&rsquo;t one of them!)</h3><p> <br/> The only requirements for working with a financial advisor are: </p><li> <strong>  The desire to improve your financial health </strong></li><li> <strong>  A basic understanding of how a financial advisor can help </strong></li><li> <strong>  A willingness to pay for that help. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> An advisor will help you make sense of your finances and then work with you to create a plan to help build your wealth and protect your assets in the future.</p><p> When Susan called that morning, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to calm her fears. &ldquo;If you ask for directions to my office, what do you think my first question will be?&rdquo; I asked. Without hesitation, she replied, &ldquo;Where are you coming from?&rdquo; Exactly. I assured her that to help her and her husband move forward, all I needed to know was where they were now. &ldquo;Just bring what you have, and we&rsquo;ll take it from there.&rdquo; I could hear her sigh of relief. She didn&rsquo;t have to live the nightmare after all.</p><p> Susan and her husband showed up that morning with three bulging boxes of files. But we didn&rsquo;t start by diving in right away. Instead, we talked about the even more important and much more simple aspects of their financial lives: their ages and years until retirement, their children, their living situation, and their estimated savings. We discussed their goals for retirement, and what each of them felt would truly make them feel at peace financially. It was just the first step in the right direction.</p><p> Are you ready to take the first step toward a more solid financial future? Let&rsquo;s schedule a time to meet. Bring your file boxes if you&rsquo;d like, but the only thing you need to know for certain is that you need&mdash;and want&mdash;help.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are but how you deal with incompatibility&rdquo; ~ Leo Tolstoy</h3>In our practice, we have come to believe that there is very little incompatibility in behaviors that cannot be adapted for.  For some partners, getting along and approaching problems similarly comes more easily. Others may have behavioral traits that require them to work a little harder.  Forewarned is forearmed; with the correct understanding, it is possible to make sure that you are always taking into account who they are and who you are to make sure your approach is the best one possible, even for people with whom you may not have an automatic connection.However, we feel a little differently about the importance of sharing at least some of the same values when it comes to compatibility and long-term stability of a business partnership. The ability to see some things the same way will avoid some fundamental conflicts.  If you have too many values in complete opposition, you may find it hard to understand the motivation behind their decisions and where they choose to focus their energy.If you value altruism, while your partner is more focused on monetary gains, but no one has made their interests explicit, you may have trouble agreeing on certain uses of partner time, for example, without understanding why you feel differently. It is so easy to assume that everyone sees the world as you do.  We can assess underlying values to help you see where values overlap and where they diverge.  When you see that you have at least some values in common, you have a base from which to explore where you are different and look for ways each of you can feel satisfied.  When disagreements start to arise, you will have the tools to more easily take the perspective of your partner. This results in less conflict and more agreement for all of the partners.",

    "link": "what-to-do-when-markets-plunge-five-tips-for-keeping-it-cool",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  This January proved to be the worst start to the year for U.S. stocks, with most investors losing money during the month. </strong> And, while the market has moved upwards, the recent correction raises a common concern for many investors&mdash;what do I do when markets plunge?</p><p> While I don&rsquo;t recommend attempting to guess where the market is going, it&rsquo;s important to have a game plan at the ready, should things get ugly. Obviously, the market can&rsquo;t go up forever and corrections are normal and natural. And, while market declines are never easy, having a plan in place will help alleviate the stress and enable you to stay committed for the long-term.</p><h3> <strong>  Below are my five tips for keeping it cool when markets fall. </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> Buy More. </h3><p> <br/> If your time horizon and risk profile allows for it, a drop in prices could be viewed as an opportunity to add to your investment. As Warren Buffet once said, &ldquo;Whether its socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it&rsquo;s marked down.&rdquo; Could prices keep falling? Absolutely. If the prospect of prices falling further scares you, consider implementing a dollar cost averaging strategy. Pick a dollar amount and a time period, and make regular contributions to an investment. For example, you might commit to investing $100 on the fifteenth of each month for six months.</p><p> The key is to commit to the strategy and not be influenced by where you think things might be going and change your plan mid-cycle. To help lower the temptation, consider automating the process with the help of your financial advisor or custodian.</p><h3> The More You Read&hellip;The More You Will Know. </h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m not suggesting following daily headlines; instead, educate yourself with books from well-respected authors who can help you become a smarter investor. In my experience, anxiety about money and investing can often be reduced through education. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to start, I recommend Carl Richards&rsquo; Behavior Gap. It&rsquo;s an easy, informative read, great for new or experienced investors and even financial professionals.  </p><h3> Do Nothing. </h3><p> <br/> During volatile periods, investors often feel inclined to make changes to their portfolio. Taking action gives people the perception of control&mdash;even if those actions do not generate positive results. Even though doing nothing during a turbulent time is extremely difficult, it can actually be better than doing something. Don&rsquo;t lose sight of your long-term goals&mdash;be patient and do nothing.</p><h3> No News is Good News. </h3><p> <br/> While it&rsquo;s important to stay informed, the more you update yourself on market fluctuations, the more volatile it will appear. Remember&mdash;no one truly knows what will happen next, nor does your media outlet have insight to your personal financial situation or your goals. Turn off the news (broadcast, online, social media, etc.) and disconnect from the frenzy, at least temporarily.</p><h3> Reassess Your Risk Tolerance. </h3><p> <br/> Recent events are a good reminder that markets don't always go up. Use this time to reflect on your behavior over the last couple of months and reassess your tolerance for risk. Were you worried? Did you panic? Did you lose sleep? Perhaps your portfolio is not positioned appropriately. If it is not in line with your tolerance for risk, you might have a harder time holding on during times like these.</p><p> Regardless of how you feel when markets plunge, remember you can&rsquo;t predict or control the markets. Have a strategy in place that helps mitigate your risk (and lower your stress levels) and stay focused and committed to your long-term goals.</p>",

    "link": "why-pr-five-reasons-to-implement-a-strategic-public-relations-campaign",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  The promotion piece of the marketing mix can be complex, with companies often struggling to pin point which tools to use, where to invest marketing dollars, how much to spend and so on. </strong> And, while most businesses have a general knowledge of marketing and public relations (and many excel at it), it&rsquo;s often hard to determine the optimal amount/ways to spend that often-limited budget to achieve the greatest ROI.</p><p> Whether you&rsquo;re a startup or a Fortune 500 company, who&rsquo;s been in business for 50-plus years, there are plenty of things to keep in mind when considering PR. Below are five reasons for implementing a strategic public relations campaign:</p><h3> Customers Buy from Companies They Trust. </h3><p> <br/> Reputation is at the heart of all that you do and PR is the ideal tool for building reputation and trust with prospective customers. There&rsquo;s a big difference between you telling people you&rsquo;re great and another credible source doing so&mdash;be it a journalist, blogger or social influencer. So, whether you&rsquo;re B2C or B2B, your target customers will value the opinion of a respected media public or influencer and will more likely see your company and, in turn, your offerings as credible and trustworthy.</p><h3> Talk is Cheap&mdash;Engage. There&rsquo;s a lot of noise out there.</h3><p> <br/> And in today&rsquo;s over-connected world, people are exposed to a seemingly endless flow of information&mdash;and from all different directions. So, how can your brand stand out from the rest? The key isn&rsquo;t to just keep talking; instead, use PR as a tool to connect. Naturally, these methods vary by industry, company&rsquo;s mission, etc., so work closely with your PR partner on identifying the best ways to connect with your target audience. </p><h3> Content Continues to Reign. </h3><p> <br/> Content has been king for quite a while and there&rsquo;s no sign of its reign ending in the forthcoming years. As is the case with engagement, creating compelling content enables brands to break through the crowd and gain attention. Whether its short videos, images, infographics, or compelling articles, create content that resonates with your potential customers, creates a connection, and makes them remember all the great points about your brand. </p><h3> Expertise Matters. </h3><p> <br/> This brings us back to trust. Most people wouldn&rsquo;t question Steve Jobs&rsquo; technology or even marketing expertise&mdash;on the contrary, he was considered a &lsquo;genius&rsquo; by many. In addition to creating products and or services, company leaders should showcase their industry know-how, and an expert positioning platform is a great way to do so. This type of platform will not only display your in-depth knowledge to potential customers, but it will also enable you to stand out from your peers and competitors and raise your industry profile.</p><h3> The Power of Social Media. </h3><p> <br/> Social media platforms create online communities, which, as we&rsquo;ve seen, can have great marketing power. Whether it&rsquo;s consumers discussing favorite brands, complaining about customer service or simply connecting with friends and colleagues, there are ample ways to use social media to get in front of potential customers. And, while you do not need to present on every possible network (seriously, don&rsquo;t do that), your PR partner can help identify the right outlets AND the right content to engage with those potential customers and further build brand awareness.</p><p> Choosing the right marketing approach isn&rsquo;t easy and varies by company, industry and your company/product lifecycle. Take a close look at your offerings, goals, and the competitive landscape before deciding on any promotional campaign. And, if raising your company profile, building trust, growing brand awareness and engaging with potential and existing customers is on your list, it&rsquo;s probably time to opt for PR.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As you know, I often get emails from readers of my  <u>  <a href=\"http://mrinsidesales.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ezine  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Secrets of the Top 20%&rdquo;, asking me how I would handle various selling situations and objections.</p><p> Someone sent in a request asking me how to deal with the, <strong>  &ldquo;We are used to the status quo and don&rsquo;t want to make waves&rdquo; </strong> objection. This reader also wrote that he had been told by another training company that he needed to, &ldquo;Make them painfully aware of something they don&rsquo;t see coming at them (like a freight train) and develop a more compelling message.&rdquo;</p><p> As you might imagine, he wasn&rsquo;t able to come up with anything that was working.</p><p> By the way, I must comment here that I frequently hear this about other &ldquo;sales training&rdquo; companies: they are quick to offer what sounds like good advice, but they don&rsquo;t provide the specific solutions to back it up.</p><p> As you know from reading my ezines, watching my YouTube videos or reading or listening to my books and CD&rsquo;s, I not only tell you what to you, but also how to do it.</p><p> In this case, I think the reader was having trouble with this technique because, to begin with, it&rsquo;s not a good approach.</p><p> Trying to convince someone that what they&rsquo;re doing is a bad idea and it&rsquo;s going to lead to big trouble (so you can say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; later), isn&rsquo;t going to endear you to anyone. What I recommend instead is to find a way to bypass this obvious initial resistance and find a way present your product or service in a non-threatening way.</p><p> Your goal on the prospecting call isn&rsquo;t to overcome objections (which this isn&rsquo;t, by the way), but rather, to qualify and set a date up to demo your product or service.</p><p> Here are some sample scripts to help you do just that:</p><h3> Objection: &ldquo;We are used to the status quo and don&rsquo;t want to make waves&hellip;&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Approach One: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely with you and believe me, I don&rsquo;t want to rock the boat. But because things change all the time, there might come an instance when you need to consider your options. So let&rsquo;s do this: I&rsquo;ll set a time to give you a brief demo of what we do and how it might help you.</p><p> After we do, you can then decide if you want to do anything with it now, or keep it in your back pocket in case you ever need to consider a different source &ndash; sound good?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Approach Two: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I understand and I&rsquo;ll try not to make too many waves here. Just out of curiosity, when was the last time you did compare services and pricing &ndash; you know, just to keep current on what&rsquo;s available to you?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Approach Three: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you and believe me &ndash; I&rsquo;m not here to cause trouble. But let me ask you this: isn&rsquo;t it wise to at least know about your options just in case you need to make a change at some time in the future?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Approach Four: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you. So tell you what: instead of me trying to sell you something, let me just educate you on what&rsquo;s currently available in the marketplace &ndash; you know, so in case you need something further down the line, you&rsquo;ll know who to call &ndash; make sense?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Approach Five: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;No problem, I fully understand. Let me ask you this though: If something were to happen to your current provider, wouldn&rsquo;t you at least want a dependable backup plan so you didn&rsquo;t miss a beat?&rdquo;</p><p> The point of these rebuttals is to bypass this resistance so you can get in front of a qualified lead and pitch your product or service. Obviously, once they agree to do a demo with you, you&rsquo;ll want to ask other qualifying questions.</p><p> As always, I encourage you to practice, drill and rehearse your responses so you can internalize them and deliver them in a natural way.</p>",

    "link": "how-robo-advice-has-upped-everyones-game",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> One of the major benefits of the intense interest and investment which has gone into creating Robo-Advice models is that institutions are investing a heck of a lot into researching why and how customers are buying financial products.For years the financial services industry has worked with theories such as &ldquo;insurance is sold, it is not bought&rdquo;, or &ldquo;investment products are too complex for consumers to research for themselves&rdquo; and certainly for an extended period of time these beliefs were largely true.  The &ldquo;supply&rdquo; side of the industry (product manufacturers as well as distribution) enjoyed the benefits of information asymmetry.</p><h3> Put simply: We had more, or better, information than the customers did, and were in the position of greatest power or influence.</h3>Well, hasn&rsquo;t THAT changed!  Raw information and research is abundantly available to any consumer with internet access and a smartphone, and that happens to be just about every person whom advisers might want as future clients.  What a lot of the market research by institutions looking to deal directly with those consumers is revealing is the extent to which consumers are embracing and actively using their access to this information.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://tonyvidler.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/consumer-decision-1-copy-400x258.jpg\"/>Financial products are nowhere near as baffling and confusing to many consumers as we like to believe.  They are figuring stuff out for themselves when it comes to deciding on product solutions.<h3> As with most things in life this is either a threat or an opportunity for an advice business, and the choice of those two really is totally ours.</h3>If on the one hand an advice business builds its value proposition or market positioning around the information asymmetry position (&ldquo;you need us because we have the research/information/smarts&hellip;&rdquo;), then this shift is definitely a threat.  In fact it is more than a threat&hellip;.you have accepted your own demise.  This value proposition for an advice business will ultimately result in commercial suicide.  You are competing with Google and every other search engine.  <strong> You will lose that war.</strong>On the other hand, we can look at this shift and realise that there is in fact an opportunity to highlight our expertise and position as coaches, or mentors, or counsellors to these consumers.  The consumers research may well be triggered by a particular need or transaction at a moment in time (as they see it), and if we are providing useful information which they are using as part of that research then we are definitely still in business.  Being a source of trusted and useful information helps with advisers positioning as &ldquo;guides on the great journey to financial freedom&rdquo;, and will open up opportunities for us to work with potential clients I believe.What the market research is revealing (and which is particularly useful for advisers) is that there are broadly three phases to the &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; approach that consumers are using;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://tonyvidler.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/consumer-decision-2-copy.jpg\"/>The first phase of &ldquo;researching &amp; reading&rdquo; is a prime opportunity for us to become a trusted information source.  Advisers can provide information as well as any other entity, and ensure that it is in with an excellent chance of being found with SEO.The second phase where consumers are essentially &ldquo;refining&rdquo; their initial views from the research is also a prime opportunity for advisers.  The networking and spheres of influence we create in the real world (not the online world) which essentially are maintained due to our ability to be trusted, respected and deliver value is the opportunity space for us to be able to educate and demonstrate how transactions work with advice. They are not mutually exclusive, are they?  So when the consumers turn to friends and family or peers to help refine their choices, that is where great advisers have a great opportunity.The third aspect to the consumers Do-It-Yourself-Decision seems to be me to be primarily about &ldquo;validating&rdquo;.  Consumers are seeking confirmation that the research and refining stages have resulted in a product solution which is not only likely to be effective, but is also likely to represent good value.  &ldquo;Want good value?  Then get some good advice with that product&hellip;&rdquo;Perhaps I am being unduly optimistic as I think about it, however the evolving patterns of consumer&rsquo;s purchasing process suggest to me that there is opportunity for advisers to position as a far more valuable resource than being mere product delivery mechanisms.  Finding and delivering product is something we can do (and do well), and it is often a necessary part of putting effective advice strategies in place.  Advisers should not be shying away from that aspect.  However, it is not the aspect which presents real value to the consumer.For advisers who figure out how their ideal clients are researching, refining and validating financial decisions, there is opportunity.  There is opportunity to be part of the assessment and education phases, and establish higher value in the consumers mind than the product element itself can.  There is opportunity to sell the value of advice.Isn&rsquo;t that what we wanted?  The opportunity to showcase the value that advisers can bring to the clients lives?",

She came in with many other candidates for a job opening and she impressed you in the interview. She was far and away the best candidate.</p><p> She has lived up to the high expectations she set in her interviews. She reduced the time it takes to deliver her service while improving her output&rsquo;s quality. Since she reduced the time she needs to complete the main job you hired her to do, she&rsquo;s been identifying new projects she can take on to help the team.</p><p> Erin is a joy to lead, but she presents you with a big leadership challenge. Her talent means she could move on to bigger roles. &ldquo;Rising Stars&rdquo; like Erin are fantastic team members &ndash; while you have them.</p><h3> Approaches for Leading a Rising Star</h3><p> <br/> For Rising Stars, follow an approach where you &ldquo;Promote Internally.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;promote&rdquo; has two meanings in this situation. No matter how much a Rising Star likes their current role on your team, you have to realize they aren&rsquo;t likely to remain in it for long. They&rsquo;re going to be looking for their next big opportunity soon.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a huge mistake to be selfish and stifle a Rising Star&rsquo;s aspirations to keep them on your team. Prepare them for their next move by helping them acquire the new skills they&rsquo;ll need at the next level. Set a personal goal to get them promoted to a larger role that will take the greatest advantage of their potential for advancing their careers.</p><h3> You owe it to your organization to find roles for Rising Stars that meet their career growth needs.</h3><p> <br/> Those roles should be within your organization. This is where the word &ldquo;promote&rdquo; takes on another meaning. You must not only be willing to let a Rising Star go to a new area in your organization &ndash; encourage them to do so and facilitate the move.</p><p> Educate Rising Stars about positions available across your organization and get a sense for what types of roles interest them. Advertise your Rising Stars as people who should be candidates for big roles other leaders are looking to fill.</p><p> Since talent attracts talent, ask Rising Stars to recruit their potential replacements. You can benefit from this approach of finding great new roles for Rising Stars. Talented people are often looking for their next great development opportunity.</p><p> If you build a reputation for helping talented people come into your organization, grow, and then move on to bigger roles, other high potential people will notice. Before you know it you&rsquo;ll have a steady stream of high performers knocking on your door asking if you have any open roles on your team. They&rsquo;ll do this because they&rsquo;ll know they can come to your team for developmental opportunities. Not only will you not hold them back but you&rsquo;ll guide them to their next great role after your team.</p><p> Once they do join your team, you&rsquo;ll have productive team members delivering great results which, in turn, makes your results look fantastic. While in the short term it hurts to lose a Rising Star to a new role, long term it&rsquo;s a great method for building a high-performing team.</p><p> The best way you can develop a Rising Star&rsquo;s skills is to give them the space to run on their own to learn by doing. Who knows &ndash; they might teach you a thing or two.</p><p> Do you have a Rising Star on your team?  How do you approach leading them?</p>",

They ask us to repeat ourselves as we are passed from one call-centre to another; they try to sell us things at inappropriate times; and they offer us products which we already have or could never afford.</p><p> <img alt=\"Don't do stupid things 1\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/customerinsightleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dont-do-stupid-things-headline.png?resize=940%2C681\"/></p><h3> What is happening out there?</h3><p> <br/> So why are organisations doing stupid things in the first place? Why not simply look at your customers and meet their needs based on their immediate requirements and stop doing things which will annoy them. Sometimes that means doing nothing at all.</p><p> Is this something we can really do? Absolutely. The first thing we need to understand are the principles of not doing stupid things. The image below outlines the four basic principles.</p><p> By thinking about these every time we interact with a customer or prospect we are able to take the first step. However these principles alone do not allow us to always meet the need of the customer or prospect.</p><h3> The Elements Of Getting It Right</h3><p> <br/> We need to put in place the elements which we can use to filter the things we want to talk to a customer about.</p><p> <strong>  Context </strong></p><p> Context comes first. It can mean many different things, which are illustrated below.</p><p> <img alt=\"Don't do stupid things context\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/customerinsightleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/context-attributely.png?resize=940%2C894\"/></p><p> Some of these needs will be implicit (not expressed by the consumer) and some of these will be explicit. The one question which context answers is: &ldquo;is this appropriate for my customer right now?&rdquo;.</p><p> Context means we are looking to remove anything which is not appropriate. For example if someone is making a complaint, it&rsquo;s not worth trying to sell them something. If they are looking to make a change to their insurance policy it&rsquo;s not worth asking them if they would like to enrol into online banking.</p><p> <strong>  Business Rules </strong></p><p> Once we have determined the most appropriate thing to say we need to move onto the business rules.</p><p> The business rules allow us to answer the question &ldquo;does the customer qualify for this offer or message?&rdquo; I experienced a good example of this from my insurance company. They offered me breakdown cover when I was renewing my car insurance policy. I thought it was great value and having both with one provider made things more convenient. I accepted their offer and the paperwork arrived in the post that week. I read through the paperwork (having been caught out in the past) and saw my car was not covered for the breakdown cover, as it was over ten years old.</p><p> So I was offered breakdown cover by a company who knew how old my car was, yet they went to the effort of offering me breakdown cover, only to have a dissatisfied customer and the cost of not doing business due to the paperwork and refund. Thank goodness I checked the fine print!</p><p> <strong>  Analytics </strong></p><p> The final piece illustrated below is analytics. It may be surprising to see analytics as the last thing we look at, but we really don&rsquo;t need to know the most relevant thing to offer a customer if they are ringing up to make a complaint. Deal with the complaint first.</p><p> Analytics allow us to rank the remaining offers to present or communicate an offer based on relevancy.</p><p> <img alt=\"don't do stupid things analytics\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/customerinsightleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/getting-it-right-attributely.png?resize=940%2C576\"/></p><h3> Putting All Three Together</h3><p> <br/> A customer rings up to tell their bank they&rsquo;ve bought a new house and they want to update their contact details.</p><p> The context would mean I could talk to a customer about home moving-related offers only.</p><p> Business rules would remove anything about mortgages (as they are already moving and are already with someone) and we would remove home insurance offers as they already have home insurance with us too.</p><p> Analytics then highlights three things. A question on the age of the home, a short-term loan, or premium banking which includes mobile phone insurance at home and free accident cover in the home.</p><p> The call-centre agent then asks how old the house is to determine the best offer. The customer tells the agent it is a new build. Therefore a loan might not be relevant given the age of the property. The agent then offers the customer the premium banking service which covers accidental breakages at home and mobile phone cover at home.</p><p> Now this is probably not an atypical event, but think of all the stupid things which could have occurred. We could have offered a mortgage quote, home insurance or a loan for home improvements.</p><h3> Stupid Re-targeting</h3><p> <br/> One of the worst examples of doing stupid things is re-targeting display adverts.</p><p> I recently went online to buy a new fridge. I did the usual research on a couple of review sites and then went onto a few retailer sites to find the fridge I wanted at a competitive price and availability.</p><p> I bought the fridge from one of the retailers and I then proceeded to receive banners for the following week asking me if I wanted to buy a fridge. Unfortunately there was no &ldquo;stupid things call to action&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t need another fridge. One of the adverts was even from the retailer I purchased the fridge from!</p><p> You would think stopping offers of something I bought from them only in the past week wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard!</p><h3> What To Do Next</h3><p> <br/> If we want to stop doing stupid things firstly we need to identify things we can stop doing. These are usually the easiest things to achieve as it means switching things off rather than creating something new. To do this we need to recognise the needs of the customer at the time they are interacting with us. That means using context to determine what is appropriate. Secondly not offering customers products they already have or wouldn&rsquo;t qualify for. Finally it means analysing customers to present them with relevant offers, based on their behaviour or value.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Most individuals want to hold on to every penny earned, so at tax time, we look for ways to deduct expenses, especially the high-cost medical bills. <strong>  But Uncle Sam's tax code is extremely complicated and difficult to understand, so you need guidance. </strong></p><p> When organizing bills during tax season, you may question whether some are legal write-offs and whether or not you should claim them. You may hesitate because you have fallen for the myths about the IRS and you see them as a big bully. The most significant fears the public shares about the government giant are the fear of an audit and the fear of going to jail. They are the ones that deter legitimate claims. But most tax experts claim less than 1% of public every experiences either. So, don't fall for the myths and forget the expenses that could significantly impact a refund. The keys to getting a rebate: don't get in a hurry and learn all you can about deductions.</p><p> To help you understand the legitimate write-offs, I asked the  Seniorcare.com  Aging Council to share the deductions that most seniors and family caregivers dealing with long-term care fail to report:</p><p> Non-medical home care is not nursing care, and it's a legitimate tax write-off as a \"medical expense.\" <strong>  Laurie Miller, Apple Care Companion </strong></p><p> If you've met with an estate planning attorney last year, some legal fees are allowable as a deduction. We believe that close to twenty percent of the costs paid to the firm is legal tax advice. <strong>  Evan Farr, Farr Law Firm </strong></p><p> Since every state is different, refer to your family tax preparer. Always maintain a record book of costs when caring for someone. That means dates/time, receipts, and everything you spend. <strong>  Scot Cheben, CaregivingAnswers.com </strong></p><p> Veterans qualify for certain tax deductions. For everyone else, there is a \"7.5% rule.\" If your elderly parent hires you as a formal caregiver, the aging relative can claim an itemized deduction for the services as a medical expense that exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. <strong>  Michelle Jeong, LifeAssist </strong></p><p> At-home personal care is an IRS tax write-off if the individual is \"chronically ill.\" The nurse or a physician must verify that the person requires the assistance or has a cognitive impairment. <strong>  Patricia Grace, Home Helpers </strong></p><p> Track and log expenses: Mileage, parking, tolls, and lodging for your dependent's medical needs, home adjustments and modifications, medical equipment, family caregiver financial support in some situations, long-term care services, co-pays, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs not covered by health insurance. <strong>  Ben Mandelbaum, Senior-Planning.com </strong></p><p> Every situation differs. Check with the IRS or read \"Table 3-1 in Chapter 3 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax for Individuals. The document gives an overview of the claim exemptions for a dependent. <strong>  Kaye Swain, SandwichINK </strong></p><p> Check with tax accountants on the dependent tax credits for your state. Some family members can claim older relatives in certain situations but know the rules are stringent. Also, you may apply your \"employee\" flex spending account for a care recipient's needs. But in most cases, hire a reliable CPA to help guide you through the options. <strong>  Alex Chamberlain, Easy Living FL </strong></p>",

You may be asking yourself what the reasons are for this major shift in HR and how it will affect your company? Here we&rsquo;ll share the six major reasons your company needs an HR revamp.</p><h3> 1. Stack ranking is out</h3>Stack ranking does not work. Despite its popularity during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s, companies began to realize that it actually works to tear down teamwork by pitting employees against each other and encouraging office politics. Though mounting evidence has been building against the system, it was when founding company <u> <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/how-ge-renews-performance-management-from-stack-ranking-to-continuous-feedback-360-feedback?_ga=1.249224900.277172318.1451490280\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  GE </a></u> decided to move away from stack ranking that the evidence became clear. According to the <u> <a href=\"http://www.i4cp.com/productivity-blog/2012/07/16/four-major-flaws-of-force-ranking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Institute for Corporate Productivity </a></u>, the number of companies practicing stack ranking plummeted from 49% in 2009 to 14% in 2011.<h3> 2. The Problem with Annual performance reviews</h3>Similarly the <u> <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/real-time-feedback-because-your-employees-hate-the-annual-performance-review?_ga=1.182686437.277172318.1451490280\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  annual performance review </a></u> is already becoming a thing of the past. In today&rsquo;s rapidly changing work environment employees need advice and training more than once a year. <u> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/07/21/in-big-move-accenture-will-get-rid-of-annual-performance-reviews-and-rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  95% of managers </a></u> are unhappy with the way performance reviews are conducted in their companies. Furthermore, evidence has proven that the stress caused by annual performance reviews triggers our body&rsquo;s natural <u> <a href=\"http://www.feedback.tips/receiving-constructive-feedback-for-employees-from-managers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &lsquo;fight or flight&rsquo; </a></u> reaction.<h3> 3. The Need for Better Data and Greater Transparency</h3>Basing assessments solely on annual performance reviews and stack ranking is not only ineffective, but also inaccurate. <u> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/07/21/in-big-move-accenture-will-get-rid-of-annual-performance-reviews-and-rankings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  90% of HR leaders </a></u> question the accuracy of the information received. <u> <a href=\"https://www.cebglobal.com/blogs/is-the-performance-management-system-dead-or-creating-zombies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Research </a></u> shows that two-thirds of performance management systems actually misidentify top performers regardless of forced rankings. The reason for this is that they&rsquo;re highly subjective. When someone rates you the rating often says more about them than about you. Motivation for example is an abstract concept. If your manager rates you on how motivated you are at work it&rsquo;s based on what they consider to be high and low amounts of motivation. Business consultant Marcus Buckingham calls this the <u> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/02/most-hr-data-is-bad-data\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  idiosyncratic rater effect </a></u>. <u> <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/how-performance-reviews-are-reinforcing-gender-bias-5-steps-to-fight-against-it-performance-review?_ga=1.119789259.277172318.1451490280\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Studies </a></u> show this can also result in bias against women and minorities, resulting in low performance reviews and ultimately unequal promotions and pay.<h3> 4. Modern Employees</h3>The skills that companies are looking for in an employee have changed. In the fast pace changes of the modern business world, especially in the tech industry, professional skills have an average life of <u> <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/heytodd/the-modern-learner-infographic-final-v4120414\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2 &frac12; to 5 years </a></u>. This means that employees must constantly be learning to keep up with new trends. Even more than technical ability, companies are looking for creative young talent that have a high learning capacity. However, even with the ability to learn quickly, these employees also need managers who will spend more time (more than once a year) on coaching in order to keep up to date with the latest trends.<h3> 5. Millennials</h3>The new generation of workers have the reputation of being disloyal and impatient. This is not necessarily a bad thing. <u> <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/understanding-millennials-and-the-opportunities-they-bring-to-the-workplace?_ga=1.119789259.277172318.1451490280\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennials </a></u> are smart and tech savvy. This generation is more likely than others to have advanced degrees and, growing up in the social media age, they are always hungry for more information. However, they&rsquo;re also used to getting answers instantly in real-time. What millennials want is more training and opportunities for development and they have no qualms about job hopping until they find it. In a <a href=\"http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/1-5-employees-rather-call-sick-face-performance-reviews/?utm_campaign=20151028_hrdaily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=SG&amp;utm_content=topstory\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> survey</a> by TriNet and Wakefield Research, 85% of millennials reported they would feel more confident if they could have more frequent performance conversations with their manager.<h3> 6. What we know now about motivation</h3>Employees want to be recognized for their efforts. Showing appreciation for a job well done goes a long way. In a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-on-employee-engagement-finds-70-of-workers-dont-need-monetary-rewards-to-feel-motivated-211394831.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> survey</a> 83% of employees found recognition for contributions to be more fulfilling than rewards or gifts. Furthermore, a number of HR experts are now finding that focusing on improving an employee&rsquo;s strengths, rather than weaknesses, boosts motivation. However, to make strengths based training work managers must have more <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/what-the-best-managers-are-asking-their-employees-in-1-on-1s?_ga=1.118674762.277172318.1451490280\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> frequent discussions</a> with employees to help them pinpoint and <u> <a href=\"http://blog.impraise.com/360-feedback/maximize-your-employees-potential-with-personalized-performance-development-plans-performance-review?_ga=1.118674762.277172318.1451490280\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  develop these skills </a></u>.

    "content": "<p> At Koski Research,  <u>  Engagement IQ </u>  studies are our corporate playground &ndash; they&rsquo;re the area where we test new theories, learn and have a little fun.</p><p> As a proprietary research tool, Engagement IQ asks questions in four simple areas, to wit:</p><p> <strong>  Likability </strong>  &ndash; how positive or negative do you feel about the person or company?</p><p> <strong>  Lunchability </strong>  &ndash; would you have lunch with the person or company CEO?</p><p> <strong>  Postability </strong>  &ndash; would you post something about the person or company on Facebook?</p><p> <strong>  Readability </strong>  &ndash; would you read an article about the person or company?</p><p> In past Engagement IQ studies, we&rsquo;ve compared  <u>  <a href=\"http://koskiresearch.com/category/engagement-iq/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pope Francis and Donald Trump  </a> </u> , and have even looked at gamification of research questions in today&rsquo;s environment, a la Tinder &ndash; i.e. would you &ldquo;swipe left&rdquo; or &ldquo;swipe right&rdquo; on a given brand?</p><p> Our ultimate goal with Engagement IQ is to deliver insights around engagement with companies based on sentiment, positioning in the news and social media. And we&rsquo;re always trying to dig deeper and push the limits of our understanding, and by extension &ndash; yours.</p><p> With the above in mind, we&rsquo;ll suggest that reliance only upon &ldquo;old school&rdquo; and traditional marketing metrics may cause you to overlook important, conceptual aspects of engagement.</p><p> Traditional marketing research looks at functional attributes like ease of use, level of service provided, performance, etc., as well as emotional attributes such as caring, trust, and leadership. While these are still important facets to measure, today&rsquo;s consumers &ndash; particularly Millennials &ndash; often seek more experiential engagement with brands.</p><p> So, just as Koski Research has evolved its methodology and techniques when it comes to Engagement IQ, we&rsquo;ll suggest that researchers should evolve customer engagement surveys to include some conceptual &ldquo;new school&rdquo; metrics that can account for some of the &ldquo;fuzzy-but-important&rdquo; experiential and emotional connections that consumers seek.</p><p> Doing so will help researchers gain more meaningful insights into the behavioral aspects, like purchasing and recommending, required to build and sustain high-value brand relationships in the digital age.</p><p> While customer experiences for every brand are different, Koski Research proposes that you consider eight key metrics around &ldquo;engagement intelligence,&rdquo; for future studies addressing the Millennial generation and beyond:</p><p> <strong>  1. Is your brand Authentic? </strong>  Can customers relate to your brand? Are you believable in what you deliver?</p><p> <strong>  2. Is your brand Transparent? </strong>  Do they believe you do what you say, and say what you do?</p><p> <strong>  3. Is your brand Empowering? </strong>  Do you provide an experience that makes your customers feel empowered?</p><p> <strong>  4. Is your brand Inspiring? </strong>  Do your products and services inspire your customers to take action?</p><p> <strong>  5.

The catch is that the judges can&rsquo;t see them, they can only hear them. If they want someone on their team, they press a button, their chair turns, and one of the judges who turned their chair becomes their mentor moving forward in the competition. No chair turned; you&rsquo;re off the show.</p><p> Last week&rsquo;s episode had two people who had auditioned in the past:</p><li> A woman who auditioned seven times and never made it to the blind audition in front of the judges.</li><li> A man who made it through all the qualifying rounds and auditioned last year in front of the judges yet didn&rsquo;t get a chair to turn. <br/>  </li><p> I was mindlessly watching the episode when my daughter spoke up.</p><p> &ldquo;That woman kept practicing and auditioning &ndash; seven times. The guy tried last year and didn&rsquo;t get it. She kept trying, had a great attitude and got picked. Why was he complaining so much? Seven vs. two. What a terrible attitude. You can&rsquo;t do something now while worrying about what happened in the past. This is a new time.&rdquo;</p><p> It seems my daughter listens to me more than I realize. Besides, she has always intuitively had leadership wisdom worth sharing.</p><h3> Every day, every time you try again, it&rsquo;s new, fresh &ndash; expect the best.</h3><p> <br/> His going in position was &ldquo;I hope that this won&rsquo;t be the same as last time.&rdquo; Her going in position was &ldquo;I get another chance to show them what I know I can do.&rdquo;</p><p> This guy was freaking himself out that he didn&rsquo;t make it before, instead of enjoying all that this time would bring. He&rsquo;s talented and made it through, but I wonder if he&rsquo;ll get far always lugging that  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/packing-success-suitcase/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  heavy suitcase filled with his past failure  </a> along with him.</p><p> I&rsquo;m reminded of the movie Singles which I watched a lot when I graduated college.

It sucks when you&rsquo;re unable to believe that YOU CAN because you couldn&rsquo;t in the past.</p><p> The key?&hellip; Remember that the past is your past &ndash; good or bad it doesn&rsquo;t define you, it&rsquo;s only a part of your story that&rsquo;s still unfolding.</p><h3> Bottom line: Now is a new time and it&rsquo;s yours to rock n&rsquo; roll. </h3><p> <br/> Are you willing to put down your crap, stop sabotaging yourself, and create your future by intentionally stepping into the gateway of this moment?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Daniel Burrus, New York Times bestseller and one of the world&rsquo;s leading futurists on global trends and innovation, shares his thoughts about how to create a legacy of impact. To Daniel, a great legacy revolves around collecting and sharing a portfolio of unforgettable memories. He offers sound advice only gained through years of experience and deep introspection.</p><h3> Laura Roser&rsquo;s Q&amp;A with Futurist Daniel Burrus <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> We do a lot of work helping individuals create a legacy and pass on non-financial assets, such as wisdom, beliefs, values and so on. What is your take on how one goes about creating a great legacy&mdash;either in his or her family or in the community?</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> The first thing that comes to mind when you&rsquo;re describing that is, what I want in my old age is a widely diversified portfolio of unforgettable memories. Now, if you think about that statement for just a minute, memories are usually not a solo thing, they&rsquo;re usually shared with someone, because, in my mind, the best experience is a shared experience. You have to have that context. If I have great memories and they&rsquo;re unforgettable, most likely other people that were with me have those unforgettable memories, and really amazing, unforgettable memories you share with people, and they share with people, and it inspires people to create more unforgettable memories. It&rsquo;s amazing and I&rsquo;ve had people that have shared unforgettable memories with me that I can see posting those unforgettable memories on their social media sites, to others and it creates a web. Of course, when it comes to unforgettable memories, you need to be making deposits often. That&rsquo;s one level.</p><p> Secondly, it plays into the second part that you talked about which is values and beliefs. One of the things that I started doing when I was working on my first book back in the 1980s was, I was thinking of putting in some quotes of other famous people, because in my mind, a good quote usually was one sentence and it was of a piece of wisdom, meaning it was a guiding principal. Because I couldn&rsquo;t find a good definition of wisdom in the dictionary so I came up with my own, a guiding principal that can be stated in one sentence. I started asking, as I was starting to look at others by Einstein, and Bob Dylan and so on, I started realizing, &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;ve got some guiding principals that have really helped me.&rdquo;</p><p> I started coming up with my guiding principals. Once you write them down it&rsquo;s easier to share them with family, friends and others because for some reason, the act of writing them down indelibly etches them in your mind&rsquo;s eye. Even though when I come up with one, I write it down, frankly, I&rsquo;ve never had to re-look at my old list because it&rsquo;s in my mind&rsquo;s eye, I can recall them any time I want.</p><p> My suggestion for people is, number one, you have amazing guiding principals that have helped you live a wonderful life, that you would love to pass on, but if you can&rsquo;t write them, if you can&rsquo;t state them in a memorable way, they won&rsquo;t be passed on as well. I would suggest spending a little bit of time thinking, what are the things that have, if you have fantastic kids that have done amazing things, what are the guiding principals that helped you to do that? It would be good to share those with your kids so that their kids could be doing that.</p><p> Or if you&rsquo;ve been very successful in business, what are the guiding principals that have helped you overcome obstacles and do those amazing things? Again, convert them into a one sentence guiding principal. You can look at quotes of others to give you some ideas of how that might work. So, it&rsquo;s a way of capturing something that then can be shared and spread, because if you can&rsquo;t capture it, then you&rsquo;re relying on hope that others will have those values. Now, of course with that said, I&rsquo;ll also suggest that how you lived you life and you how you act on a daily basis is in reality, teaching those values and principles because there&rsquo;s an old saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you say, it&rsquo;s what you do,&rdquo; that people notice. That&rsquo;s there of course, but what I&rsquo;m doing is increasing the odds by suggesting you log them, get them written down so that, again they can actually be shared for generations to come.</p><p> <strong>  LR:  </strong> Speaking of that, even writing them down makes a change on your behaviors as well.</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> Well, of course because we get busy and we&rsquo;ve got to keep those important self-discovered lessons in the top of our mind rather than buried in our deep subconscious where they may not be acting and working, so it keeps them more top of mind, so that you can access them and use them.</p><p> One other little tip that I can give people on that. When you&rsquo;re talking to people, this may be a work, this may be family and friends, every now and then, one of those guiding principals will come out. You&rsquo;ll notice it when you say it because it really is powerful. In your subconscious mind you kind of say to yourself, you know that little voice that talks to you in your head? It may say, &ldquo;Wow, that was good,&rdquo; but the trouble is, you keep talking and because you keep talking, it is not parked in a permanent memory spot in your brain. You won&rsquo;t remember it, and therefore you can&rsquo;t bring it back up whenever you want, because it&rsquo;s in a part of the brain that&rsquo;s so temporary that it&rsquo;s gone. All you will remember is that you really said something great and you wish you could have remembered it.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a technique that I would like your readers to try, and that is, when one of those great, little one sentence guiding principles, wisdom lines comes out of your mouth when you&rsquo;re talking to someone, and I don&rsquo;t care how important a meeting it might be, stop and say, &ldquo;Wow, hey, that was good. Let me say that again,&rdquo; and say it again. Now there&rsquo;s two things that are happening. Number one, it was good, you should say it again, not only for you but for the people you were talking to, &ldquo;Hey that was a good one.&rdquo; Secondly now by stopping and saying it again, you put it in a different part of your brain where it&rsquo;s now not in the discard pile along with all the other words that you say in everyday conversation, it&rsquo;s now in a holding tank. Think of it that way, where you can access it for probably another, four, five, six hours before it gets discarded. In other words, now you&rsquo;ve got time to write it down after you&rsquo;re done with the conversation.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> Wow. I love that. What are your thoughts about how to create a legacy that impacts many people or a community?</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> If you look at the definitions of legacy. Of course a lot of them involve giving property or money to people after you die. It could be a gift but it also, of course, talks about something that comes from someone in the past, but it&rsquo;s vague. My take on this, my definition might be, leaving a lasting impact that goes beyond time and place. In other words, none of us know how long we&rsquo;re going to be on planet earth before we move on to whatever is next, depending on your views and your beliefs, but is there a way that you can reach out from the grave and still have an impact? To me, that&rsquo;s what legacy is&mdash;being able to reach out from the grave and continue to have a positive impact on others.</p><p> We all do this in different ways, in my case I&rsquo;ve written six books that have been translated in multiple languages. For the last 33 years, I&rsquo;ve been getting a little over a 100 articles a year published, so I&rsquo;m pretty prolific. I&rsquo;ve got a newsletter that&rsquo;s been in publication for 30 years that has a large global reader base. I&rsquo;ve given 3,000 keynote speeches around the world. This last year one of my audiences was 15,000. Obviously I&rsquo;m putting a lot out there and so I&rsquo;m trying to share wisdom and guiding principles that can help people.</p><p> The reality is with all of that, they aren&rsquo;t going to know anything that helped them would come from me necessarily. You know what? I don&rsquo;t care. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be tied to me at all to leave an impact and a legacy. It just has to be something that helped others and they&rsquo;ve passed it on and it was used. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be tied back to me to be important. I think there&rsquo;s a selflessness that is part of a &lsquo;leaving a legacy&rsquo; because usually when you leave money it&rsquo;s very self-focused, uncle somebody or grandma somebody gave us, you know, whatever name you want to put on the end, gave us this money.</p><p> Often the gift of money doesn&rsquo;t do what the person leaving the money would have liked. Sometimes it becomes a curse, just like winning the lottery, so many people go broke in a short amount of time. The legacy to me, is always more than money and property because those things can be squandered. It&rsquo;s something deeper than that.</p><p> Again, I&rsquo;m perhaps unusual in having been prolific in writing and speaking and all the work that I&rsquo;ve done, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean we cant do that at work and at home, and with the people that we influence, even if it&rsquo;s with Cub Scouts, or with Girl Scouts or if it&rsquo;s with coaching a basketball team, all of that is where you can pass on that wisdom, that then is part of your legacy.</p><p> Then there&rsquo;s one other element on a personal level I&rsquo;ll share, and that is, again I&rsquo;ve been doing this for quite a long time, and you know one of the hard trend certainties is that we don&rsquo;t get younger, we continue to get older, and so for the last several years I&rsquo;ve been taking all of the principles that I&rsquo;ve been teaching, and all of the things, and all of the books and all the articles, and everything, and putting them into what I call a &lsquo;Legacy Project&rsquo; meaning something that can help people beyond my time and place. In this case, for me, it was creating what I call the &lsquo;Anticipatory Model&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Anticipatory Learning System&rsquo;. I created it to be what&rsquo;s called &lsquo;evergreen&rsquo; which means the principals are timeless, so they aren&rsquo;t tied to news of the moment.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-20-at-1.44.19-PM.png\" width=\"821\"/></p><p> It&rsquo;s small, in this case it&rsquo;s got four components to it that have seven lessons in each. They are very short, three to four minute single concept videos of me. Then a rapid application tool of how you can apply each principal to whatever you do, your life, or your work. I won&rsquo;t go into more detail on it. That kind of a program can go on without me having to be there, giving speeches, and doing all these things. Again, it&rsquo;s kind of corralling, think of it as, in my mind, my greatest hit concepts, the ones that have made the biggest difference, and putting it into a system that doesn&rsquo;t need me and can be translated into multiple languages, which of course, we&rsquo;re doing. I actually, intentionally created a legacy system. Again, I might be unique, not all of us are authors and so on, but I&rsquo;m just giving you an example of what I tried to do to keep that going.</p><p> One other last thing that I&rsquo;ll just mention regarding myself and legacy, because I&rsquo;m using myself as an example just to stimulate, just to give people ideas. That is, when I started my company over 30 years ago, and I was speaking and consulting and taking my methodologies to all of these companies all around the world, I wanted to make sure that, again they were being spread not just to the adults, but also to the kids. I trained a number of presenters that go into elementary and junior high schools and teach the principals in the form of school assemblies. They really don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s connected to me. Probably none of them even heard my name doing it. Nobody knows I do it. If you look on my website you won&rsquo;t see anything about it, because again, it&rsquo;s about selfless giving, it&rsquo;s not about, &ldquo;Gee am I cool? Look what I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;I need to know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; Basically I&rsquo;m using a Johnny Apple Seed approach, which means, you just plant a lot of seeds, some will grow.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve one presenter, for example, that has been doing this for decades, and has been in, I think something like, 8,000 schools. If you take an average of about a 1,000 kids per school times 8,000 schools, just from that presenter alone, you have quite a few seeds that were planted. Been doing that for 32 years now. That is a way of building legacy as well. Obviously I thought about that when I was 30 something years younger than I am now. Legacy doesn&rsquo;t have to be done by a gray-haired, older person, I&rsquo;m actually suggesting that those Millennials and younger people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s start thinking about, &ldquo;How do you start building your legacy even when you&rsquo;re young?&rdquo; because one of the predictable things about the future is, you&rsquo;re going to get older.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> Unfortunately, right? But I guess there are some pros.</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> The good thing about getting older is, we&rsquo;ve never been smarter than we are at that point in time. You&rsquo;ve got collective knowledge, collective wisdom. A young person can&rsquo;t go out and take a seminar or take a class on wisdom and get much out of it. I mean, a lot of it has to be earned over time. We have strengths as we get older, of course, we have weaknesses too. We don&rsquo;t know all the new technology, we don&rsquo;t know all the new stuff, but what you want to do is take your strengths and do the mentoring and the sharing, and the coaching, and those kind of things to help young people with what they don&rsquo;t have, because they have a lot of things we don&rsquo;t have.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> Yeah, absolutely. It&rsquo;s interesting in my work, it&rsquo;s actually pretty refreshing to see how many young people are really interested in building a legacy.</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> Absolutely, absolutely. Frankly I think the things that have been written about, for example, Millennials and we have younger generations than that of course, too. A lot of that is very generalized, and some of it is really not all as true as we would think. We&rsquo;re all humans on this planet and I think there are human wants, needs, desires, ambitions. If you get right down to the core of it, one thing about all of us, again as we get older, so if you say, Millennials are this, well this is what they are in this point in their life, but what happens when they&rsquo;re 10 years older or 20 years older and 30 years older? They&rsquo;re not doing what they were doing 10 or 20 or 30 years before. They have evolved. They have grown. They&rsquo;ve got different needs, different wants, different desires because they go through the different stages of life. I think, again we put labels on things but we should always be careful of that.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> Oh yeah, I completely agree. I like it though. It seems as though a lot of Millennial types have a service, giving back mentality at a pretty young age, anyway, I like that.</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> Yeah, yeah and you know, I&rsquo;ve got to say, I am definitely a baby boomer. Yet I know when I was in upper elementary school, I was volunteering to fix toys for kids that couldn&rsquo;t afford them for Christmas, and giving back. I&rsquo;ve been doing that all along. I think that really it&rsquo;s not about a generation that either gives back or doesn&rsquo;t give back, there&rsquo;s always a percent of people in every generation that just have that and maybe it came from part of a values legacy from a grandma or grandpa or something or from a mom or dad, or maybe it just came from their own heart, or they&rsquo;re like that. The thing that I think is important is for that behavior to inspire others that maybe didn&rsquo;t have that in their life and they say, &ldquo;Well you know what? I could do that too.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where things get interesting and fun.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> Could you expand a little bit about documenting your legacy for the average person who may not be a writer or have a proclivity for writing or producing content?</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> Absolutely. First of all, I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate, for example, my last book was a New York Times, Wall Street Journal bestseller and so on. The reason is, it&rsquo;s filled with stories. Another part of legacy we&rsquo;ve already talked about is, getting the values and the beliefs and the principles and sharing those. Story is one of the best ways to bring those to life. I think sharing those stories that have a &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moment or a incite in it, are really important. We can do that, of course with our kids and with relatives, and with friends. You don&rsquo;t have to be what would be considered, a professional storyteller, because let&rsquo;s face it, some people are maybe better at stories than others, but story is a great way to share.</p><p> Let me tell you something that I did. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s appropriate for this or not, but it&rsquo;s part of sharing the story. That is, like I would say she was, and I&rsquo;m talking about my mother now, she was maybe 79 or 80. I took the old super 8mm films that were taken way back when we were kids and converted them to something that could be shown on a television set, but none of them had any sound, and I put them all together. What I did without her knowing is, I had a little tape recorder set up, and I just said, &ldquo;Hey let&rsquo;s watch these because you haven&rsquo;t seen these in decades yourself,&rdquo; because you know, who watches all their old stuff, right? I sat with her and I asked her questions as it was on. There was some video of my mother and father, I was the oldest, before I was born, and I said, &ldquo;Hey tell me again how did you meet dad?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tell me again about this.&rdquo; So here she is with all these memories out in front of her, telling me all these great stories. Some of them, by the way, I&rsquo;ve never heard.</p><p> What was I doing? I was capturing her voice. Now, neither she nor I knew that two years later cancer would end up becoming fatal for her. That was way back in the year 2000 and she&rsquo;s no longer around, but I have her voice on record. You might ask yourself, if you&rsquo;ve got an aging relative, have you captured their voice? Because once they&rsquo;re gone, their voice is gone. My father passed away when I was much younger, many, many, many decades ago, and hey there&rsquo;s no recordings of him, so his voice is forever gone. Thinking ahead of time, doing something like that, especially if you&rsquo;ve got somebody that&rsquo;s important to you that&rsquo;s aging, it&rsquo;s a way of not only capturing the story, but also capturing the voice.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> How do you avoid getting overwhelmed by information? It seems that everyone has their social media accounts, and they post various things. How do you pick out the memories or the stories or things that are most important to pass on? Do you have any thoughts on that?</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> Yeah. I think one of the things is, within your social network you might say, &ldquo;Hey why don&rsquo;t we share a little more of the story rather just a moment?&rdquo; Because sometimes it&rsquo;s a picture and, &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m on vacation,&rdquo; wherever they are you know? Hawaii. Well instead of just a picture and I&rsquo;m on vacation in Hawaii, tell me a little something about what you&rsquo;re doing or what you did? Make it a little bit more interesting. You actually are telling within your social media network, what you would like to get, and think, and by the way, they probably would like to get that too. One way to do it is, just like in life, be the example. Instead of just putting out things that frankly, take your time and have little value, you&rsquo;ve got a little story. So, if you&rsquo;re putting a picture, put a story with it rather than something that has little value, so that&rsquo;s number one.</p><p> Secondly, technology is benign you know? It isn&rsquo;t good or bad, it&rsquo;s how we decide to use it, so we need to be a little bit more laser like as to how we us social media so we don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed by it. Maybe there are people you&rsquo;re following that are really not giving you what you want, they&rsquo;re just taking up space. Well, maybe you should unfollow them. Maybe there are people that are not only showing you a picture of the new baby, but telling you a little bit about that new baby, and that new baby and that person is important to you, well you know that&rsquo;s somebody you want to see. I think, it&rsquo;s kind of like separating the wheat from the chaff a little bit so you&rsquo;re not overwhelmed.</p><p> <strong>  LR: </strong> Yeah. Let&rsquo;s say you want to pass on a legacy to your kids or just build certain principles or stories, in your opinion, is there a way to determine what&rsquo;s important? Let&rsquo;s say, I don&rsquo;t know, you went on five Hawaii vacations and they were all great. How do you determine experiences with impact to pass on versus &lsquo;this was a fun vacation involving a fantastic pina colada&rsquo;?</p><p> <strong>  DB: </strong> That&rsquo;s a good question. Remember I said, I&rsquo;d like a portfolio of unforgettable memories? Out of those five vacations, what were the unforgettable memories? Those are the ones that you want to share, because there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that isn&rsquo;t because it could be easily forgotten. What are the unforgettable parts? Well, that narrows it down quite a bit. What&rsquo;s the thing that you will always remember about Hawaii? I&rsquo;m giving you an example of, ask better questions, you get better answers. Ask a better question of yourself, you know? &ldquo;I spent two weeks in Hawaii, what was the thing that surprised me the most? What was the thing that touched my heart the most? What was the thing that I learned the most?&rdquo; Well now, all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re going to get some ideas, rather than, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to talk about. How do I know, it was just Hawaii?&rdquo; Well no, it wasn&rsquo;t just Hawaii, there were things that happened there. Again, ask better questions, you&rsquo;ll start getting better answers.</p>",

When we start playing verbal ping pong with another person and are determined to win the point. When we want to shut up and simply don&rsquo;t know how. Yes. When our mouth seems to have an unstoppable mind of its own.</p><p> Shift from your clever-thinking mind back into your body. It&rsquo;s where energy gets blocked. It&rsquo;s where we unblock it. I&rsquo;m talking about the very simple act of letting your body do the work for you.</p><p> Next time you feel stuck, make a simple physical adjustment.</p><h3> Invoke the benefit of the subtle physical shift: <br/>  </h3><li> A conscious deep breath</li><li> An upward arch of the spine</li><li> A wiggle of the butt in our chair</li><li> A firm flex of the arches of your feet on the floor</li><li> A circular roll of our shoulders</li><p> Out of the head. Into the body. This is the conundrum, of course. In the moment when we need the help of our body most, we tend to ignore it with stubborn willfulness.</p><p> It takes only a second or two. With our return to the body, we shift our energy and the energy of any conversation we happen to be in. Better yet, we need not understand how the shift works. We just need to trust that it does. Let our body do the magic.</p><p> Another conundrum. We require the help of our mind to shift back into the body. Not the clever-thinking-mind. No, the talk-to-my-body mind. It&rsquo;s the mind that remembers how sometimes the move forward is through the body. Cultivate this part of your mind. Make talking to your body a habit. Think small physical adjustment. Think energy shift.</p><p> Mental note: When you find yourself in a clever conversation that is going nowhere, remember. Shift out of your clever-thinking mind, into the body. The benefits of a physical shift far exceed thebrevity of the act. They always do. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>",

    "link": "7-reasons-etfs-are-todays-mutual-fund-alternatives",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s true that ETFs and mutual funds are often called &ldquo;sister&rdquo; investments because of their similarities. But investments in ETFs have been growing at an accelerated pace while mutual funds are just recovering from major outflows during the peak years of the recent financial crisis. We believe that certain key differences make ETFs the preferred choice for many investors today. Here are seven reasons why.</p><h3> ETFs trade just like stocks</h3><p> <br/> ETFs are traded on the major stock exchanges with share prices that fluctuate the same as any stock. Limit orders can be used to control/execute trades, and put and call option trades are available. Not so for mutual funds, whose share price is calculated once each day at close of market. No limit orders, no option trades allowed.</p><h3> ETFs fully disclose portfolio holdings every day</h3><p> <br/> Compare that to monthly or quarterly disclosure of portfolio holdings for mutual funds. </p><h3> ETFs are more accessible to investors</h3><p> <br/> ETFs can be purchased in any brokerage account whereas mutual funds&rsquo; availability depends on distribution agreements with brokers/dealers (in some cases, they may be purchased from fund sponsors directly).</p><h3> ETFs are generally less expensive to trade*</h3><p> <br/> As client services are generally handled by the broker, ETF expense ratios are most often lower than those of mutual funds whose sponsors must incur all the administrative and distribution fees.</p><h3> ETFs are typically more tax-efficient</h3><p> <br/> ETFs can conduct in-kind redemptions and avoid actually selling holdings that trigger capital gains, which can reduce tax liability for investors. Mutual funds&rsquo; ability to manage tax liability is largely limited by the cash requirements to create shares.</p><h3> ETFs can be traded on margin</h3><p> <br/> Just like stocks, ETFs can be bought and sold on margin, allowing investors to benefit from leverage. Margin trades are not allowed for mutual funds.</p><h3> ETFs have lower minimum investment thresholds</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Beginner&rdquo; investors can actually buy single shares of ETFs. Most mutual funds restrict entry purchase to minimums that range from $1,000 to $2,500 (although for IRA accounts, those minimums are usually reduced).</p><p> For information please visit us  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-7-reasons-etfs-post-32516\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p>* ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a buy or sell is executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs compared to mutual funds.",

    "content": "<p> A very long time ago &ndash; very early in my career, I remember reading about legendary Packers Coach Vince Lombardi&rsquo;s emphasis on being fifteen minutes early. This discipline guided my approach to arriving at sales and business meetings throughout my career, and I am grateful for having espoused Lombardi Time. Recently though, I have observed that leaders are frequently missing the point about simple punctuality, and this is causing the unnecessary wasting of resources, and it is giving a very unfortunate message to peers and subordinates in the enterprise.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s my blunt perspective on the issue.</h3><p> <br/> When someone shows up late occasionally, there are often good reasons, and we should acknowledge that. However, when someone shows up late persistently, they are making a choice to be late. When that person is the senior member of the group&mdash;or worse, the entire enterprise&mdash;the message they are giving is that they are quite comfortable with squandering the organization&rsquo;s resources. They are also confirming their view that their own agendas rank ahead of those who are frustrated and waiting for them to show up! Either way it is a very shortsighted discipline and a bad message.</p><p> Is there a more simple way to set the tone for collegiality and the importance of the stewardship of resources than by being on time? More than this, do a little math; add up the aggregate time lost by people waiting on you; multiply that through their compensation rates, and then multiply that through the number of events where this is allowed to happen. The net loss goes straight to the bottom line!</p><h3> Above all this is one key word: Respect.</h3><p> <br/> In the world that I spend a significant part of my life now, there is an expression, &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care what you know until they know that you care.&rdquo; All we have to do is show up&mdash;on time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  How many Apple products do you own? </strong>  Is that your second cup of Starbucks? Uber&rsquo;s 5 minutes away!  Oh, just Venmo me! </p><h3> <strong>  What do all these brands have in common?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> They all deliver a highly memorable, personalized, consistent experience each time you interact with them, and that&rsquo;s why you keep buying their products/services! This makes you their &lsquo;brand advocate&rsquo;&hellip;a walking, talking, outstandingly free promoter of their brand. </p><p> <strong>  So the real question is </strong> &ndash; With competition always lurking, instant ways to openly communicate dissatisfaction, and people&rsquo;s flaky mindset (those millennials), how do you create brand advocates?</p><p> It&rsquo;s tough for any brand to produce loyalists, but it&rsquo;s a trickier road for long established companies that have to prove their legacy to the next generation of buyers.  Typically traditional organizations are guilty of &ndash; practicing the &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo; methodology or just taking a conservative approach to innovation &ndash; 2 things that go against advancement.  Although these strategies can still generate revenue in the short-term, either tactic is a recipe for extinction in the long run.  So where do you start&hellip;it&rsquo;s essential to first agree on the need for a change and then envision how to position the brand in today&rsquo;s digital, ever-evolving world.  This requires gathering the right people to join the conversation&hellip;ones that will be honest about the risks, paranoid about missed opportunities, and enthusiastic forward-thinkers.  The dream team should include people of all ages, backgrounds, expertise, and most importantly those that are empowered (mainly because it&rsquo;s contagious).  The objective should be to create a brand that shows next gen buyers that it is persistently adapting and innovating, while maintaining one constant &ndash; a stellar experience (and by experience, I&rsquo;m not just talking about good call center service).</p><h3> <strong>  Make Me Feel Like I&rsquo;m 1 in 85M </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are so many ways to attract customers to a brand, but making them life-timers is the key.  One classic way companies lure consumers is through incentives (millennials love free or discounted stuff, right?).  Yes, sure, a free t-shirt with your logo on it will make them happy for a day or so, but do you really think it&rsquo;s enough for them to channel their inner-cheerleader?  Believe it or not, millennials crave a more tailored experience.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - there&rsquo;s nothing off-putting about free giveaways, but it&rsquo;s an incentive - not a memorable, personalized, consistent experience.  Let&rsquo;s define &lsquo;incentives&rsquo; and &lsquo;experience&rsquo; (Webster)&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Incentives </strong> &ndash; something that encourages a person to do something</p><p> <strong>  Experience </strong> &ndash; the process of doing and seeing things and of having things happen to you</p><p> Based on the definitions, incentives require you to give something to someone in order to get them to do what you want, whereas an experience implies active and equal involvement from all parties. Incentives seem short-lived and momentary, while experiences are more permanent and unforgettable.  So with millennials&rsquo; spending power on target to drastically increase by 2017, organizations need to start thinking about how they can establish themselves as timeless brands through unique experiences.  For industries like financial services and retail that rely heavily on their incentive programs to appeal to customers (reward points and cashback benefits), the focus needs to shift from offering lucrative deals to the masses to delivering authentic, &lsquo;just-for-you&rsquo; moments. </p><h3> <strong>  Sell the Journey </strong></h3><p> <br/> Now that we established the need for an experience strategy (survival), it&rsquo;s all about how you transition an ordinary consumer into a brand advocate.  For millennial buyers, one of the most engaging things an organization can do is host an event.  Branded VIP parties, exclusive sneak peaks, and influencer-only events appeal to spontaneous millennials who want to feel like trendsetters among their peers.  A successful event should take its attendees through a journey &ndash; made up of multiple genuine experiences (including giveaways&hellip;remember incentives are okay as long as they don&rsquo;t define the whole brand).  The host&rsquo;s job is to make everyone feel like a unique character throughout the journey, and then towards the end or after the event, paint the bigger picture to show them that they were all part of something great.  This approach taps into a millennial&rsquo;s desire to have a highly tailored interaction that is unforgettable, collaborative, and purposeful&hellip;and if done right, it truly delivers an exceptional experience for both the organization and consumer.  So how can you beautifully execute this?</p><p> <strong>  Before the event: </strong> Create quality content that can boost interest and begin sharing it out 10 weeks in advance.  Use email teasers to get everyone excited and think of 2 hashtags to keep conversations trending around the event.  Tweets with hashtags get 2x more engagement than those without, but be careful because using more than 2 actually reduces engagement by 17%.</p><p> <strong>  During the event: </strong>  Encourage relevant discussions, line up engaging speakers, good music, and worthy participants for successful networking opportunities (don&rsquo;t forget the free swag either).  Continue to promote the event on check-in apps and social media.  If you&rsquo;re fundraising, you&rsquo;ll raise 10x more online.  According to Adweek, 81% of millennials shared a photo on social from an event they went to, 71% used the event&rsquo;s hashtag, 67% followed the brand on social, and 56% signed up for an email list.  Also, depending on the type of event, live streaming is a great option for those that couldn&rsquo;t attend&hellip;watching it virtually usually encourages them to attend in-person next time.</p><p> <strong>  After the event: </strong> Keep in touch with your attendees by continuing to use the hashtags to share fresh content about the brand and future events.  Create a Facebook album or Instagram pictures from the event and encourage participants to tag themselves.  Send a personalized email to those that signed up for the email list including a link to a survey.  Leverage the data you gather from social media and the survey to design a lead generation campaign based on their event experience.  And finally, keep hosting these events to gradually convert more and more of your customers into brand advocates&hellip;it&rsquo;s all about the journey!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> You read in headlines several times a week: Hire Women Advisors. And with a lot of good reason behind it&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Why the recent push to recruit women advisors? Of course, it&rsquo;s politically correct to do so and satisfies a diversity initiative. From a business growth perspective, studies have shown that women clients prefer to work with women advisors. And it&rsquo;s always a PR bonanza to hire women.</p><p> And while women may be reading this and cringing, truth be told, these statements represent the reality that we are dealing with. As a woman &ndash; and having worked with some of the industry&rsquo;s leading firms and top female advisors &ndash; I&rsquo;ve heard the story from both sides of the table: there are opportunities that are being missed.</p><p> Currently, men outnumber women in the advisory industry 4 to 1. That&rsquo;s a big spread considering that research is telling us that women seem to be naturally well-suited for the profession. And as Eleanor Blayney, Consumer Advocate for the CFP Board, wrote in the Wall Street Journal in October of last year, &ldquo;Studies are now beginning to show that adding more women to professional teams fosters creativity, workplace morale and even enhances profitability.&rdquo;</p><p> Makes sense to me. Anecdotally speaking, the women advisors I have been privileged to work with over the years have been amongst the most well organized, responsible, responsive, personable and consultative people.</p><p> I am not suggesting, by any means, that male financial advisors are any less worthy or client-centric. Realize that I am certainly not the first to recognize that as a whole, women financial advisors seem to embody what it is to be a great steward for clients&rsquo; personal and financial goals. Studies have shown that women have a greater tendency towards empathy and education&mdash;thereby creating a greater comfort level and connection with women clients in particular, who are looking for someone who clearly understands their needs.</p><p> At a recent TD Ameritrade LINC conference, panelists agreed that if advisory firms are going to reach more women as clients, they&rsquo;re going to have to hire more of them as well. But doing that will require some changes from a cultural perspective. So we&rsquo;ve developed this list of nine considerations based on our experience in working with both female and male advisors and their stories about where they have seen success and failure&mdash;and how you can develop an organizational environment that both attracts and retains female advisors. </p><h3> 9 Considerations to attract and retain female advisors <br/>  </h3><li> Nothing turns someone off more than the feeling that she is being sold to. So don&rsquo;t be pushy.</li><li> Listen and allow others to be heard.</li><li> Show that you have the horsepower and smarts to meet their needs, advocate for them and support their business.</li><li> Attention to detail matters&hellip;A LOT! Nothing will kill a deal faster than dropping a ball, missing a deadline or not following through on a commitment.</li><li> Connect the dots. And don&rsquo;t spew platitudes. Instead SHOW them how you will help solve for whatever the issue(s) at hand.</li><li> Stay in close touch: More communication than less almost always wins the day.</li><li> It is critical to treat them as equals&mdash;look them in the eye, be sure their questions are answered and needs are met.</li><li> Demonstrate understanding of their business and who they are as people. Look for the areas where they are frustrated currently and suggest creative ways to solve for the issues.</li><li> Introduce them to other successful advisors at your firm who can talk about the culture, how you support them, how they&rsquo;ve grown since joining, and answer any questions honestly and without agenda. <br/>  </li><p> Generally speaking, women are more risk averse than their male counterparts and as such, it usually takes more pain to make them choose to leave behind what&rsquo;s familiar to them. But, once that pain threshold is reached, women will typically want to rip off the proverbial Band-Aid and move through the decision making process pretty quickly. The decision to leave is almost never motivated solely by personal financial gain, but instead by being able to do a better job for clients.</p><p> So, while men may outnumber women in this industry, you should expect a dramatic shift over the coming years. Consider that an opportunity for your business, and do what you can now to be more attractive to potential women candidates because they have plenty of other fish in the sea to choose from.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The benefits of brainstorming have seeped into the culture at large, straight from the marketing and sales culture where the idea originated. <br/>  </h3><p> But these benefits only go so far. When faced with a truly daunting sales deadlock, it&rsquo;s important to take it a step further. That&rsquo;s where dealstorming comes in.</p><p> Dealstorming is creating a multi-dimensional, cross-departmental team to broaden the chances of finding creative solutions to issues that can occur in the sales process.</p><p> In an interview with Tim Sanders, author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://timsanders.com/dealstormingbook/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dealstorming: The secret weapon that can solve your toughest sales challenges  </a> </u> , he explained his seven-step process for dealing with any major sales deadlock.</p><p> While working as the Chief Solutions Officer at Yahoo (and as a consultant for a wide range of B2B companies), Sanders realized that when sales and marketing teams come together to solve a sales challenge, they succeed far more often than when the sales team tries to handle it alone.</p><p> Below is the seven-step dealstorming process that Sanders outlined during our interview with him on the  <u>  <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/b2b-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   B2B Growth Show  </a> </u> :</p><h3> 1) Qualify <br/>  </h3><p> Before anything else can happen, you have to determine the scope of the dealstorming process.</p><p> Based on the complexity of the sales challenge and the value of the sales opportunity, how many people need to be involved?</p><p> <img alt=\"7 Steps to Break Through Any Sales Deadlock | Sweet Fish Media 1\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/7-Steps-to-Break-Through-Any-Sales-Deadlock-Sweet-Fish-Media-1-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> Is this a small enough project for the Fantastic Four or should the entire Justice League be involved?</p><h3> 2) Organize <br/>  </h3><p> Once the size of the team is determined, it&rsquo;s time to start recruiting your new power team to join the cause.</p><p> Generally you need to ask yourself two questions when looking for team members: Who already has a stake in this project? Who are the experts?</p><p> Recognizing when a project will be beneficial for someone can make it easier to win their help, as it gives you talking points to get them on board.</p><p> Another good way to inspire people within the business is by bringing in the idea of rivalry with a major competitor. Sanders mentioned that when he was with Yahoo, he would use their competition with AOL/Time Warner to spur team members into action.</p><p> Sometimes the people available within the company may not be enough. Looking for what Sanders calls &ldquo;deal mentors&rdquo; from outside could be the final piece in creating a dynamite dealstorm team.</p><h3> 3) Prepare <br/>  </h3><p> So the next step should be meeting with the team, right? Well, sort of.</p><p> Before you actually gather your team in a room to discuss the issue, you should make sure that everyone is on the same page by sending them a deal brief to outline exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</p><p> The brief should only be around 2-3 pages so that it&rsquo;s compact but contains clear information.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll want to include the following: an overview of the issue, an influence map of all the major players involved, what has happened to bring you to this deadlock, any relevant current information in the news, and even individual thinking assignments to get the wheels in everyone&rsquo;s heads turning.</p><p> Taking the time to prepare everyone helps keep the meeting from turning into an info dump.</p><p> Send out the brief a few days before the meeting so that the team&rsquo;s ideas have time to properly incubate. If you can put a weekend in between the sending of the brief and the meeting, so much the better.</p><p> You want to find the happy medium between giving the ideas time to mature and giving the thinker so much time that they forget about the ideas all together.</p><h3> 4) Convene <br/>  </h3><p> <img alt=\"7 Steps to Break Through Any Sales Deadlock | Sweet Fish Media 2\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/7-Steps-to-Break-Through-Any-Sales-Deadlock-Sweet-Fish-Media-2-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> Now that everyone is properly prepped, it&rsquo;s time to meet up. But even the term &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; can be stilting. Rather, think of it as a gathering of minds.</p><p> An effective hack here is to have everyone meet 10 minutes before the official meeting time. This helps make sure everyone is present and social niceties are out of the way so the meeting can actually start on time.</p><p> For the first fifteen minutes or so, you&rsquo;ll want to figure out what the real problem is that the team is trying to solve. Don&rsquo;t assume that you know what the real issue is already. You&rsquo;ll really want to get to the root of the deadlock to come up with the best solution.</p><p> The bulk of the gathering should be discussing what the next best play will be. After all, that&rsquo;s really the whole point of this first meetup.</p><p> Unlike in a brainstorming session, a dealstorming meeting should look critically at ideas that are presented while everyone is still in the same room. The point is to figure out where to go from here.</p><p> This could mean combining a couple of the strongest ideas or finding the one idea that everyone can live with.</p><h3> 5) Execute <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s important to remember that in sales situations like this, time is not on your side. That&rsquo;s why the execution step is all about quick action and rapid problem solving.</p><p> Short deadlines are important here.</p><p> One thing that can help with this is prototyping. Creating mockups or drawing out the idea for a process can help others to visualize what exactly is happening and rectify any issues quickly.</p><p> Prototyping removes some of the more abstract elements of creative thought, which can disguise problems for far too long. And you don&rsquo;t have time for those kinds of problems.</p><h3> 6) Analyze <br/>  </h3><p> There are several points to look at carefully when figuring out if a dealstorm team is working out for you.</p><p> <img alt=\"7 Steps to Break Through Any Sales Deadlock | Sweet Fish Media 3\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/7-Steps-to-Break-Through-Any-Sales-Deadlock-Sweet-Fish-Media-3-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> For one thing, are you making progress on the deal? In his book, Sanders explains how he views the progress of a sales venture in terms of four levels. If you aren&rsquo;t leveling up, it may be time to reconsider your approach or reevaluate the wisdom of continuing the venture at all.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also important to look at externalities like collateral damage and collateral benefits that have come from the steps you&rsquo;ve taken.</p><p> The dealstorm team should also be analyzed carefully. Pay attention to who had the right idea in meetings, who had the wrong idea, and how well the group listened to each. It may be necessary at this point to make changes to the team, but you won&rsquo;t know unless you carefully evaluate their input and results.</p><h3> 7) Reporting <br/>  </h3><p> This step is really all about closing the loop and making sure that everyone is on the same page. It&rsquo;s important to be transparent with the team on the results of your analysis.</p><p> You&rsquo;re more likely to get important feedback if you keep reporting continuously throughout the process of the deal.</p><p> Reporting is also essential for establishing best practices in future sales ventures. If something emerges from the dealstorming that turns out to be better than the regular sales process, it&rsquo;s vital that you get that incorporated into the regular sales process quickly.</p><p> <img alt=\"7 Steps to Break Through Any Sales Deadlock | Sweet Fish Media 4\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/7-Steps-to-Break-Through-Any-Sales-Deadlock-Sweet-Fish-Media-4-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> A study by  <u>  <a href=\"http://deepermedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Deeper Media  </a> </u>  showed that on average it takes 30 months for a process to get implemented across the board. Meanwhile, higher-level companies only take an average of 91 days to do this.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> When confronted with a major sales deadlock, creating a collaborative team from multiple departments can help you reach new and better solutions.</p><p> Brainstorming may help to spark new ideas, but dealstorming can help you achieve more fully-formed ideas that can be put into action to solve the problem in less time.</p>",

It is not at all uncommon for owners to engage in discussions and even begin negotiations to sell their businesses before contacting any advisor.</p><p> If the only consequence to owners in this situation was that they limited what advisors could do to help them, it would be unfortunate.</p><p> Instead, the consequences assume biblical proportions, &ldquo;But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter&rdquo; (Jeremiah 11:19 and  <a href=\"https://www.exitplanning.com/definitiveguide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Definitive Guide </a> , page 146). The &ldquo;owner without an advisor&rdquo; is the ideal scenario for professional buyers. They likely prefer to come to an agreement with a successful business owner without the owner understanding the full range of options available to sellers in today&rsquo;s M&amp;A market.</p><h3> Lambs To The Slaughter <br/>  </h3><p> If your owner/client is one of these lambs, there are three possible outcomes:</p><p> 1. Least common: The business is sold to the best buyer at the best price;</p><p> 2. Not uncommon: The business is sold, but either the buyer or the price paid is not ideal or maximal; or</p><p> 3. Most common: The business is not sold.</p><p> In this article, we&rsquo;ll look only at the third, and most common, result of a buyer-initiated sale process: No sale. </p><h3> No Sale For Stan <br/>  </h3><p> Stan Adams&rsquo; company operated in a niche market&mdash;the online sale of South American organic foods. His market was growing and was already dominated by four international firms. It was one of these four who approached Adams and initiated several months of haggling over price. Ultimately, the two parties parted ways leaving Stan emotionally drained and his company with lost ground to make up while Stan had concentrated on the negotiations.</p><p> This was not the first time Stan had waded into the marketplace unprepared, nor the first time he had halted negotiations. Two years earlier one of the other four firms had expressed interest in buying Stan&rsquo;s company. Again, the parties negotiated for months before giving up over a failure to agree on the company&rsquo;s value. In that case as well, Stan&rsquo;s business had suffered from his inattention, and Stan was quite discouraged.</p><p> Only after two strikes did Stan realize that his unplanned approach was both inefficient and ineffective. He contacted two investment banking firms to assess his sale prospects, but in their preliminary market analyses, they discovered that the likeliest buyers for Stan&rsquo;s company were the two companies that had already walked from negotiations. The investment bankers approached these buyers, but both passed on taking a second look at the company. Stan finally recognized that his prior approach was worse than inefficient and ineffective. His actions had turned the two best buyers into uninterested bystanders. Professionals in the M&amp;A community see this scenario so often that they have a name for it: &ldquo;tainting the marketplace.&rdquo;</p><p> At best, talking to buyers without preparation is an expensive lesson in terms of time, energy and money. For Stan and many others, the consequences can prove to be far worse.</p><h3> What Can You Do? <br/>  </h3><p> You can help your clients avoid this scenario if you reach out to them before they talk to buyers, and before a buyer chooses the third-party exit path for them. You must educate owners on several key points:</p><p> 1.  Moving forward with the first qualified buyer who approaches them is not the same as moving forward with the best buyer who will offer the best terms.</p><p> 2.  Most buyer-initiated relationships do not end in sales that maximally benefit sellers. In the pursuit of what seems to be a great opportunity, owners give leverage to one buyer rather than making several buyers compete for the opportunity to own the company.</p><p> 3. Responding to prospective buyers consumes&mdash;and often wastes--money and energy.</p><p> 4.   Owners who respond to the likeliest buyers in their niches &ldquo;taint the marketplace &rdquo; because buyers rarely look again at a business they have already rejected. They justifiably wonder: Why is the seller coming back? Is something wrong, seriously wrong, with the business? Has it suffered setbacks?</p><h3> The Advisor Dilemma <br/>  </h3><p> How do you reach out to owners before you receive the &ldquo;Can you look over this Letter of Intent&rdquo; phone call? If it is any consolation (and it shouldn&rsquo;t be), BEI&rsquo;s owner surveys indicate that few owners (about 15%) have ever had even one conversation with an advisor about their plans to stay or exit their businesses. The only way you can preempt the &ldquo;Letter of Intent&rdquo; phone call is to target your owner/clients with consistent information about the most important financial decision of their business lives&mdash;their business exit. Call it a marketing campaign if you prefer, but we know that you must take the initiative. Owners will not.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  The average mid-cap growth mutual fund comes with a 1.3% expense ratio. </strong> Whether this seems high to you or not might depend on how well these funds have done relative to common benchmarks. Semi-annual research from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, operating independently from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, continually paints a stark picture that many of these funds may not be worth the cost.</p><p> In this article, we will focus on domestic equity mutual funds with plans to discuss fixed income in another one, but encourage you to view the full report at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.us.spindices.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.us.spindices.com  </a> </u>  to learn how international equity and taxable bond funds performed. (There were also some pockets of strength for these mutual funds.)</p><p> Just 20% of all mid-cap growth and 12% of all small-cap growth funds outperformed the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Growth and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Growth indices, respectively. Meanwhile, 51% of all large-cap growth funds outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Growth index.</p><p> On an equal-weighted basis, the average mid-cap growth fund returned -1.23% and lagged by 328 basis points in 2015, much higher than the expense ratio incurred. This suggests to us that unwarranted stock selections contributed to underperformance.</p><p> <strong>  The average mid-cap growth fund returned -1.23% and lagged by 328 basis points in 2015, much higher than the expense ratio incurred. </strong></p><p> Upon review of the mid-cap growth funds open to retail investors and with the most assets shown on MarketScope Advisor, Baron Growth Fund (BGRFX) and Putnam Equity Spectrum (PYSAX) were in the bottom quartile of this peer group in 2015. PYSAX has a 27% weighting in consumer discretionary, significantly larger than 15% weighting in the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Growth index.</p><p> In contrast, Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) was a strong performer, rising 5.6% in 2015.</p><p> Investors who want to largely replicate the performance of the S&amp;P 400 Growth index can use iShares S&amp;P MidCap Growth (IJK). IJK has $5 billion in assets and has a 0.25% expense ratio.</p><p> Meanwhile, small-cap growth funds lost 2.2% in 2015, lagging the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 growth index by 497 basis points; the average small-cap growth fund has a 1.4% expense ratio.</p><p> For perspective, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap Growth (IJT), which has $3 billion in assets, incurs a 0.25% expense ratio. In recent years, investors have been shifting assets out of actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds and into passive index mutual funds and ETFs. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence expects the trend to continue. While there are bright spots in every investment style, the appeal of low-cost alternatives that do not take sector bets is highly compelling in our opinion.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenMcGahan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jen McGahan  </u> </a> | <u>  Content Boomer </u></p><h3> Your company culture grows stronger when you maximize the marketing power of its most valuable resource.</h3><p> <br/> Your employees could be your clearest competitive advantage if they become the kind of brand evangelist like the one I met last week on a Lyft ride.</p><p> I should tell you I usually take an Uber when I need a ride. For some reason, on the rainy first night of SXSW in Austin, I was having trouble finding one, so I downloaded the Lyft app instead.</p><p> Leaving the Austin Startup Crawl, I requested a ride to my car parked several blocks away. Within one minute, my ride showed up.</p><p> The short ride with my driver, Majid, not only got me where I wanted to go, but may have turned me into a customer for life.</p><p> <strong>  What was so remarkable about those 5 minutes? </strong></p><p> The ride sharing company&rsquo;s friendly culture came through without any apparent &ldquo;marketing.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m a marketer, so I notice these things.)</p><p> Majid&rsquo;s enthusiasm for Lyft made me curious to learn more about the company and how it got its driver to be so gosh darn happy about driving (and advertising) for them.</p><h3> The million-dollar question is how does a company create this kind of loyalty within its ranks?</h3><p> <br/> A strong culture, education, personalization, and empowerment.</p><p> Without much prompting, Majid shared why Lyft was superior to Uber, not for him, <a href=\"https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/848/uber-vs-lyft/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   the driver and employee  </u> </a> ; but for me, the consumer. He assured me that Lyft had quicker pick-up times and cheaper fares than Uber, even though there were more Uber drivers in town.</p><p> &ldquo;Maybe its their ride matching algorithm or something like that&hellip; But you should always use Lyft,&rdquo; he said.</p><h3> Could you ask for a better brand advocate?</h3><p> <br/> Who&rsquo;d have thought ten years ago, that a woman would feel comfortable allowing a complete stranger to drive her in his car across town late at night? It&rsquo;s not just the pretty pink app and carstache that instills confidence; it&rsquo;s not even the community-building vibe the brand shows in its marketing, making cities feel smaller through ride sharing, etc.</p><p> It&rsquo;s the loyalty of the employees that creates that sense of safety and trust in the service.</p><p> The company&rsquo;s core values were on display, even though I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time. Researching the company later, I discovered the phrases &ldquo;Make it happen, Create fearlessly, Be yourself, and Uplift others&rdquo; are Lyft maxims that contribute to its culture.</p><p> For example, when I mentioned the recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3056457/fast-feed/ubers-head-of-design-steps-down\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   resignation of Uber&rsquo;s design director  </a> </u>  in the wake of Uber&rsquo;s recent rebranding fiasco, Majid said he thought Uber was distracted, trying to branch out into too many areas.</p><p> When I leaned forward and questioned the route he was taking (yes, I&rsquo;m one of those) he slowed down, and reached toward his phone, zoomed in on his GPS, and verified the destination, putting me at ease that he knew where he was.</p><p> Besides obvious respect for the company, Majid seemed genuinely concerned about my sense of security, a consequence of the company&rsquo;s apparent dedication to allowing their drivers to strengthen customer relationships as they see fit.</p><h3> Indeed, it&rsquo;s the company culture that elevates what would otherwise be called a taxi ride, into a pleasant and memorable experience that reflects well on the company.</h3><p> <br/> If a company&rsquo;s website tells me why I should take Lyft rides, customers may or may not believe it, but when the driver shares those same reasons while he&rsquo;s in the act of delivering on the promise, they make a stronger impression.</p><p> In an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ekaterinawalter/2013/10/15/want-to-find-brand-ambassadors-start-with-your-employees-2/#63b3671c1ff6\" target=\"_blank\">   article for Forbes, Ekaterina Walter  </a> </u>  describes how companies like Zappos and Starbucks empower their employees, and are rewarded with brand advocates who become trustworthy and enthusiastic spokespersons for their companies. Lyft seems to possess a similarly strong culture.</p><p> Can you create a sense of purpose for your company that is so clearly defined that every one of your employees can rally behind it?</p><p> My Lyft experience the other night made me realize that if your employees are also your greatest advocates, then your customers are in great hands.</p><p> As it turns out, Majid isn&rsquo;t the only one who loves the company he drives for. Other  <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce/employee-engagement\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   employee ratings on Glassdoor  </a> </u>  are equally glowing.</p><p> So now I have both ride apps on my phone. Which one do you think I&rsquo;ll use next time I need a lift?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Eamon Porter</p><h3> Every so often I meet a personal investor who will tell me that now is the right time or the wrong time to invest, depending on whether the markets are going up or down as well as depending on that individual&rsquo;s past experience. <br/>  </h3><p> Despite having 30 years of investment experience I never get into an argument with them because I know something they don&rsquo;t. Namely, very, very experienced investment professionals rarely, if ever, out think the markets. Even the greats such as Warren Buffet and Anthony Bolton acknowledge that markets cannot be outguessed in the short term and their own success owes more to long term holdings rather than short term trading outlooks.</p><p> In any event, many people who are inexperienced in dealing with investment markets (and even some who are experienced) tend to look for signs that they are right in the perspective of what is happening at any point in time. They look for reassurance about what they are thinking, or more correctly hoping, can be confirmed by one or more public facts about the markets. In Behavioural Finance terms this is referred to as Confirmation Bias. Put simply, people favour information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses even if such confirmations turn out later to be false indicators.</p><p> This behaviour is also closely linked with Herd Mentality. In essence this is where people are influenced by their peers by adopting certain behaviours and follow trends as well as possibly purchasing items. Investment history is riddled with Herd Mentality events from Tulipmania in 1637 through to recent times when global property bubbles made many seem smart before looking extremely foolish.</p><p> Newness Bias is also a well documented behavioural trait and is the desire to give more weight to recent information and ideas usually to support a particular investment outlook. This helps to support the belief that one is right because the latest set of economic data says so. Does this sound familiar?</p><p> The use of these three outlooks on investing works both ways. If markets are going upwards, they are used to justify why one should invest. Similarly, if markets are going in the opposite direction they are likewise used as justification as to why one should not invest in particular assets. It just depends on your starting position.</p><p> So the question is, if one cannot outguess the markets what should you do?</p><p> The starting point for all investing lies not in what markets are doing but rather in what you actually need in your own personal life. By defining what our own individual objectives are we can then set about expressing these in financial terms. Of course, such planning is not a simple process and requires a lot of thought but in my experience once this whole area is addressed properly investment decisions and their long term effects become more realistic, as does the evaluation of competing investment options.</p><p> After that it comes down to long term planning, and not short term reactions to investment flavours of the month. The great thing about such an approach is it allows investors to exert control over their financial outlooks rather than being held hostage to them. In other words by controlling what we can control, namely our behaviour, we can have a disproportionate positive effect on our financial well-being. This isn&rsquo;t just my view or any recent perspective. Considerable research has been done on this. As far back as 2000 Meir Statman, a distinguished economics professor based in Santa Clara University in California, produced research which showed that 93% of investor returns are influenced by their own personal decisions and not those of individual fund managers or indeed the performance of investment markets.</p><p> The bottom line? Before you make a decision to jump in and out of markets, think about what your investment objectives are and whether they are aligned to your, correct, asset allocation. If there is a mismatch then the issue isn&rsquo;t markets but is more personal. And for that you need to be aware of your own behavioural impulses as these influence your financial position more than anything else.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Right now, politics seem to have entered every public conversation. </strong> The rhetoric has reached new lows while politicians and political pundits do their best to raise the hysteria. It&rsquo;s enough to make you want to reach for the oxygen tank or the martini glass.</p><p> But lost in all the political screaming is the very real issue of the Fiduciary Standard for Financial Advice. The Department of Labor wants to extend the fiduciary standard for retirement plans under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, which is even more stringent that the requirement imposed for Investment Advisors by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. </p><p> The plan&mdash;which has been in various stages of discussion and negotiation for over five years&mdash;would require brokers (think wirehouse folk) to act as fiduciaries. To act as a fiduciary means you must act in the clients&rsquo; best interest vs the current suitability standard. Suitability means the investment must suit the buyer, without it having to be in their best interest.</p><p> Meanwhile, a House committee has approved a bill that would require the DOL to get approval from Congress before the new rules can be enacted. As the bill moves forward to the House Ways and Means Committee, investors continue to be at the mercy of product-pedaling brokers plying their trade. It seems that our politicians are much more motivated to protect Wall Street rather than the constituents they serve.</p><h3> Why would anyone stand in the way of rules that require an advisor to act in their clients&rsquo; best interest?</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s enough to rattle the brain. That is, until you see who is delaying and blocking these rules&mdash;and why.</p><p> <strong>  When you hear a candidate for office saying that the system is rigged, you&rsquo;d better believe it. </strong> Otherwise, the DOL Fiduciary Standard rules would have been put in place years ago!</p><p> The DOL regulations represent a tough standard for financial advisors giving advice on retirement assets. The result? Finger pointing and criticism coming from legislators, Wall Street and other brokers whose business would be &ldquo;adversely affected&rdquo; by the rules.</p><p> Regardless of whether or when the DOL rules are enacted or who wins out on which Fiduciary standard is appropriate and sufficient, working with an advisor who is completely transparent HAS to make more sense than hoping your broker/advisor is recommending the right product.</p><p> The politics of Financial Advice looks to continue into the foreseeable future, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to wait to work with an advisor who is responsible, ethical, transparent and acts in your best interest. There are planners all over the country who work this way. Take a walk on the NAPFA (National Association of Personal Financial Advisors) website, www.napfa.org. There you will find the fee-only folks who have signed on to the Fiduciary Standard and are committed to transparency.</p><p> The backroom deals will be done, the stalling and smoke screens that are meant to protect the interests of the very powerful will continue; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to support their schemes.  Your financial success and security depend on it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If most people had their choice, they would prefer to retire before age 65 or while they can enjoy their free time. Unfortunately, not a lot of them are preparing financially for it. If your goal is early retirement, you need to start planning to make it work financially. You may need to save more, spend less or take other steps to ensure you are on track.</p><h3> Define what early retirement means to you. <br/>  </h3><p> Everyone has a different idea of how they picture their retirement. What&rsquo;s yours? Take some time visualizing how you want to spend the next phase in your life.</p><li> When do you want to retire?</li><li> Where do you want to be living?</li><li> How do you want to be spending your time?</li><li> How much will it cost?</li><h3> <br/> What income will you be able to bring in at your earliest desired retirement date? <br/>  </h3><li> Will you be able to collect your company or government pensions at your desired retirement date? If so, how much income will this be?</li><li> If not, will your other sources of income (investments, rental, etc.) be enough to cover your income needs?</li><li> If you have a shortfall, are you willing to take other steps to achieve your desired early retirement date (work part-time, spend less and save more now, reduce your desired retirement lifestyle and costs)?</li><li> Are you willing to reconsider your desired retirement date?3. Do you have a retirement plan in place? <br/>  </li><p> Knowing the answers to the above questions means you are well on your way to having a plan in place. Meeting with a financial planner is the best next step.</p><p> A financial planner will go through the above questions and answers with you, gather all your personal information and will make a plan to help you achieve your financial goals. If a realistic and doable plan is created and implemented and you stay the course, then achieving your desired early retirement is a feasible goal.</p><h3> <strong>  Helpful Tips for an Early Retirement </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Start when you are young.</h3><p> <br/> How young is young enough to start preparing for early retirement? How old are you right now? Today is the perfect day to start preparing for retirement. If you started in your 20s or early 30s, it means you will be further along on the road to reaching your goals. If you are getting off to a later start, you have some catching up to do, but the point of getting started now still holds true.</p><h3> Make small, regular contributions.</h3><p> <br/> If you treat your RRSP contributions like a bill, you will find it easier to keep up with them. Set up an automatic deduction at each pay period in an amount you feel comfortable with.</p><h3> Ensure you participate in your employer pension plans or ESOP programs.</h3><p> <br/> If your employer offers any type of savings programs in which they will match your contributions, be sure to take advantage of this benefit. It&rsquo;s an easy way to grow your investment.</p><h3> Invest conservatively for the long haul.</h3><p> <br/> Many young investors take a very aggressive approach when choosing savings vehicles for their retirement savings. They want to make a killing in the market and make big money quickly. A much better approach is to take a slow but steady approach to investing, as opposed to going for the big gain, panicking when the market corrects and taking a loss by jumping out. Your financial advisor will ask you some questions to determine what level of risk you feel comfortable with and recommend a mix of investments that will fix your profile.</p><h3> Increase your level of savings as often as you can.</h3><p> <br/> Will you receive an income tax refund this year? Are you expecting a salary increase or a bonus from work? Try to invest at least half of this money in your RRSP. If you pay off a loan or other debt, use a similar percentage of your increased cash flow toward increasing your retirement savings.</p><h3> Review your retirement savings regularly.</h3><p> <br/> Sit down with your financial advisor at least once a year to review your investments. You&rsquo;ll want to discuss any changes in your life and how they affect your money situation. Have you gotten married, had a child, bought or sold a house? How secure is your job? Do you feel good about your marriage? Will your children be starting or graduating from college or university soon? All of these factors need to be discussed with your financial advisor.</p><h3> Make plans to transition from worker to retiree.</h3><p> <br/> You will need to make a plan to move from earning a salary to drawing from your investments, Canada Pension, and Old Age Security. Your financial advisor can help you see what those numbers would look like if you wanted to retire at different ages so you can make the decision you feel comfortable with.</p><p> As an experienced financial advisor, part of my job is to listen to clients describe their dreams for retirement and when they would like to achieve them. We work together to make them a reality.</p>",

    "link": "the-cost-of-failing-to-plan-for-and-execute-leadership-succession",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Since transition of top leaders is something all organizations have and/or will face, and there&rsquo;s heavy reliance on leadership for success, one might expect the process to be well-defined and executed. That&rsquo;s often not the case. <br/>  </h3><p> There is considerable variance in how &ndash; and how well &ndash; succession planning is integrated into key strategic plans. Also, boards vary in how they view their role in creating and implementing succession plans.</p><p> Many stakeholders would be aghast at the &ldquo;real&rdquo; cost of failing to have viable succession plans. Per strategy+business&rsquo; recent <u>  <a href=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00327?gko=8dfe1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   CEO succession study  </a> </u> , these costs are astounding.</p><p> &ldquo;Large companies that underwent forced successions in recent years would have generated, on average, an estimated US$112 billion more in market value in the year before and the year after their turnover if their CEO succession had been the result of planning.&rdquo;</p><p> Even when succession is well planned, sizeable costs are inherent. This reinforces the importance of CEO selection. Selecting the right CEO greatly reduces the likelihood of short tenure with its associated costs.</p><p> Examples of costs from unexpected CEO departures:</p><li> Severance package</li><li> Executive search firm retainer</li><li> Unplanned board meetings &ndash; with unexpected travel costs</li><li> Communications consultants, lawyers, movers&hellip; <br/>  </li><p> And those are just the easily-tallied hard costs.</p><p> Soft costs may greatly exceed hard costs. The impact of business disruption creates costly &ndash; often not short-term &ndash; issues such as:</p><li> Suddenly halted initiatives</li><li> Ambiguity tainting substantial projects</li><li> Failure to close critical deals</li><li> Disrupted third-party relationships</li><li> Employees leaving to accept positions at more stable organizations</li><li> Loss of revenue, earnings, and, if public, stock prices <br/>  </li><p> Market turbulence poses issues for even stable companies. Uncertainty due to a sudden CEO departure slows progress for some time afterward &ndash; at significant cost.</p><p> Not surprisingly, an unexpected CEO transition hits underperforming companies harder than strong, profitable companies.</p><h3> What Does &lsquo;Getting Succession Right&rsquo; Look Like? <br/>  </h3><p> Development of a company&rsquo;s succession plan should focus on four key questions:</p><li> Does the board truly &ldquo;own&rdquo; the succession process? Given the sensitivity of succession planning, it&rsquo;s advisable to schedule succession planning as a regular board agenda item. Optimally, the lead outside director will handle this responsibility, and the CEO will step out for this part of the meeting.</li><li> Does the board have a &ldquo;real&rdquo; plan? Is it private? The board should always have a summary of the succession plan immediately available. The potential successor list should always be kept secret to avoid creating employee discontent.</li><li> Does the company actively develop future generations of CEOs internally? If internal development is handled well, find the next CEO from among internal candidates is far more likely, which smooths and shortens the process considerably.</li><li> Does the company&rsquo;s succession plan focus forward or backward? Strong succession plans focus on company leadership needs for the future &ndash; which may be very different from past needs. <br/>  </li><h3> Leaving a Worthy Legacy <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s no small feat to create and recreate a stellar company. Try it when following Jack Welch as chairman and CEO of GE.</p><p> Jeffrey Immelt succeeded Jack Welch just days prior to September 11, 2001. Aftershocks substantially hurt GE&rsquo;s aviation, power generation and reinsurance businesses. And, given the finance-dominated GE Jack built, the 2008 financial crisis was another huge setback.</p><p> Jeffrey Immelt&rsquo;s success results from being market-driven and focusing on areas where GE&rsquo;s expertise is both proven and rare. He&rsquo;s returned GE to its manufacturing and industrial roots; dismantling its financial businesses. Today GE is driven to become a digital technology based manufacturing leader.</p><h3> A highly respected legacy&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Organizational leadership transition is a given. Whether those transitions are successful largely depends on careful preparation.</p><p> Action Items:</p><li> Review your company&rsquo;s current succession plan. To the extent it&rsquo;s either lacking and/or not up-to-date, set a time to review its importance and key elements with your board chair.</li><li> For critical initiatives, third-party relationships, and substantial deals, ensure multiple individuals within the leadership are intimately involved, and can keep things from going too far astray should an unexpected CEO departure become reality. (Board leadership should be involved in determining in what situations, which leaders and how to address these potential scenarios.)</li><li> Only you are responsible for leaving a legacy you will be proud of. Work on yours today and every day.</li>",

    "content": "<h3> Cold calling may still work for many advisors but for most female advisors it is often the path to failure. <br/>  </h3><p> While this activity has served a valuable purpose in the financial services industry, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to move on.  </p><p> Cold calling is such a linear activity; with no room to truly multi-task, such a repetitive act often drives women to suicidal boredom and does little to leverage their natural strengths as communicators and relationship builders.</p><p> So if not cold calling how do you build new leads and a successful business? You must get social and creative.</p><p> Beth moved across the country to start a new life and career as a financial advisor.  </p><p> Leaving Boston behind for a fresh start in Los Angeles was essential to her peace of mind, but she also left behind all her contacts and lifelong networks, leaving her with an empty database. She literally was starting from scratch. </p><p> Determined to succeed she reached out for some serious coaching which helped to launch her path to success. </p><h3> 1) Her Message <br/>  </h3><p> We first developed her focus and compelling message that became the foundation to all of her conversations and marketing efforts. The response she received calling centers of influence simply reinforced she was on the right path.</p><h3> 2) Her Strategy <br/>  </h3><p> With a focus on women we developed a two-tiered seminar strategy. One event (my Savvy Women Invest on Purpose) would be her &ldquo;branding&rdquo; event one that every woman should attend once.  While her second event would be more of a workshop and a bit more technical.  These two events both geared towards women would be her primary marketing tool.</p><h3> 3) Her &ldquo;Calling Card&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Next with event dates scheduled for the next 6 months she created a marketing post card, on the front, beautifully designed to appeal to women she shared her event title, tag line plus contact info, a sort of professional &ldquo;calling card&rdquo;. On the backside she listed the dates of all her events along with location and RSVP process.  This one card would become her most valuable marketing tool.The plan was to start walking into businesses preferably ones owned by women; small boutiques, salons, bakeries, law and CPA firms as well as women owned businesses found on Google. While this is not exactly a new and novel idea we wanted to do something that would make the process unique and more noticeable especially with the gatekeeper, which leads us to our next steps.</p><h3> 4) Her Cookies <br/>  </h3><p> She found a local bakery where she could order some cookies made into women&rsquo;s shoes, decorated in the same colors as her new &ldquo;calling card&rdquo;.  Each week she would pick up her order of &ldquo;Calling Cookies&rdquo; and make it a point to distribute to women owned businesses in the area. She knew if she didn&rsquo;t get out there and deliver these she may end up eating them, not only was that a waste of money, but would not be good for her &ldquo;bottom line&rdquo;.</p><h3> 5) Her Process <br/>  </h3><p> When she walked into the businesses, if she felt the opportunity was there she would leave the nicely wrapped cookie with a few of the &ldquo;Calling Cards&rdquo; for the owner, the uniqueness of the cookies would trigger warm conversation with the receptionist or manager and the advisor would leave with the contact information so she could follow up the next day calling as the lady with the cookies.</p><p> Most women love to keep moving, enjoy being creative and would prefer to speak to people face to face rather than being a blank face over the phone.  </p><p> By posting a standard order each week at the bakery it provides consistent motivation to make sure she meets enough new women to share her cookies but more importantly to build new relationships, add new contacts while marketing her events and branding herself as the women&rsquo;s advisor in her community. Making it fun, creative and social makes all the difference for women.</p>",

He had a cynical worldview that probably would make the work we were proposing highly challenging, if not impossible. He wasn&rsquo;t the right client for us, but back then, I was too polite (or too timid) to say so&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t that have saved us all some time!</p><p> Instead, I tried to convince him we weren&rsquo;t right for HIM. I explained that we would be too expensive&mdash;and named the highest rate we had at the time. It was a figure I was sure would have me kicked out of his office, but instead he decided we must be REALLY good. So I told him we couldn&rsquo;t start for several weeks because we were exceedingly busy. Nope, that didn&rsquo;t dissuade him either.</p><p> You know where this is going: the more I told him why he shouldn&rsquo;t hire us, the more he wanted us.</p><p> When Adam Grant talks about this idea in his new book Originals (look for &ldquo;The Sarick Effect&rdquo;), he tells stories about the benefits of leading not from unbridled optimism, but from your weaknesses.</p><p> Risky, right?</p><p> But the other party KNOWS you&rsquo;re selling. Some are ready and waiting to poke holes in your pitch (especially those super-busy corporate cynical types who are looking to narrow their choices). So why not just lead with the potential sticking points and disarm them with your candor?</p><p> You might tell potential clients right up front the truths that could get in the way of your being their ideal solution.</p><p> I can think of a few: you have no expertise in their industry; you haven&rsquo;t solved a problem exactly like theirs; you don&rsquo;t have enough bandwidth to guarantee you&rsquo;ll meet their deadline.</p><p> The worst that happens is they fold their tent and you never hear from them again.</p><p> But your approach might just build a bond between you&mdash;create a small zone of safety where none existed before. And that becomes the first step to welcoming a new client.</p><p> No, my anti-sell guy did not become client #4.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure he would have if I hadn&rsquo;t finally mustered the courage to tell him we just couldn&rsquo;t deliver what he wanted in his timeframe&mdash;and then gave him a referral to another firm.</p><p> But the next time I used the anti-sell&mdash;when I was pretty sure our track record wasn&rsquo;t as vaunted as our competitors&mdash;it worked perfectly. Our passion for the project and an &ldquo;all in&rdquo; attitude tipped the scales and they picked the underdog.</p><p> Selling by not selling.</p><p> How cool is that?</p>",

    "content": "<p> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/books/out-of-reach-but-in-sight/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Out of Reach but in Sight: Using Goals to Achieve Your Impossible  </a> </u> , I wrote about the three qualities all successful people have in common: Passion, Vision, and Commitment.I truly believe that and you can read more about it&mdash;free for a limited time&mdash;if you download the eBook from my  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/andrewlacivita/app/427089034046612/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook Author Page  </a> </u> . (It&rsquo;s the only place you can get the free eBook.)What about the four most attractive and remarkable human traits? Being successful is one thing, being attractive and remarkable is a bit different.</p><h3> <strong>  Belief </strong></h3>To maintain an undying belief in your ability to produce a positive outcome supersedes virtually everything else.I&rsquo;m sure many of you&rsquo;ve heard the expression attributed to <u> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/203714.Henry_Ford\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Henry Ford, &ldquo;Whether you think you can or you can&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; </a></u>It&rsquo;s true. You&rsquo;ll be better off being committed than unsure. And, the way you think directs your energy and outcomes. What you think about you bring about and self-fulfilling prophecies are real in both directions.Recently, I offered up a few pieces related to the new <u> <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/welcome/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Michael Hyatt </a></u> and <u> <a href=\"http://www.buildingchampions.com/who-we-are/our-coaches/daniel-harkavy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Daniel Harkavy </a></u> book called <u> <a href=\"http://livingforwardbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Living Forward </a></u>. One of my favorite quotes in the book is, &ldquo;What we see ahead impacts actions we take right now.&rdquo;If you see success and happiness, you&rsquo;ll do things today that lead you toward success and happiness. If you want to see more, check out <u> <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/youll-love-the-life-you-look-back-on-if-you-are-living-forward/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  You&rsquo;ll Love the Life You Look Back on if You Are Living Forward </a></u>.<h3> <strong>  Humility </strong></h3>Belief with a little too much bravado is, well, ugly. But, belief with a whole lot of humility is attractive.These two traits play together and in proper dosages of each become a great combination.Believing in your own ability to become successful in fantastic. Maintaining blind belief of all you believe is simply arrogant.I often think of a <u> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi\" target=\"_blank\">  Mahatma Gandhi </a></u> quote when considering these two traits. He said, &ldquo;It is unwise to be too sure of one&rsquo;s own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Patience </strong></h3>Patience helps when belief in yourself becomes tested because your efforts take time to yield results.Patience is not waiting for something to occur. It&rsquo;s maintaining resolve while you tirelessly work for what you want.Only the most patient continue to work when they struggle or face obstacles. Your belief in yourself helps keep you going. Your humility allows you to gracefully accept the challenges because you know everyone&mdash;including yourself&mdash;will encounter them. Your patience helps you withstand the length of time these efforts take.Check out <u> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Dip-Little-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Seth Godin&rsquo;s The Dip </a></u> to make sure you don&rsquo;t quit too early.<h3> <strong>  Integrity </strong></h3>To me, you&rsquo;re nothing if you&rsquo;re not ethical, honest, reliable, and trustworthy. I don&rsquo;t think I need to add anymore on this one.As always, I love to hear from you: What do you think are attractive human qualities?",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/Vadim_Zlotnikov\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Vadim Zlotnikov </a>  </p><p> Global equity markets seem much more susceptible to changes in investor sentiment, and they&rsquo;ve seen surges in volatility since August 2015.</p><h3> What should investors be watching for clues as to where the market might be headed?</h3><p> <br/> Equity gains since 2012 have been overwhelmingly driven by rising valuations, as illustrated by the large contribution of price-to-forward earnings to the MSCI World Index return (Display). Meanwhile, earnings growth was minimal. We believe this is a key reason behind the stock market&rsquo;s increased sensitivity to investor sentiment. There are no crystal balls on market direction, but many investors are understandably ready to reduce their equity beta if risks increase meaningfully.</p><p> <img src=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/blog/en/uploads/2016/03/Zlotnikov_RecentEquity_d2.jpg?uuid=cf1f81c4-e62a-11e5-99b9-45c69f3cdda8\"/></p><p> We see both sources of increasing downside risk from here and potential catalysts that could trigger a sustained rebound in equities.</p><h3> <strong>  Downside Risks </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here are three areas of risk that could result in a decline in valuation multiples.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Persistence of Inferior Growth </strong></h3><p> <br/> Continued disappointments with economic and earnings growth could feed the perception that monetary policy has reached the limit of its impact. Fiscal stimulus is at least 18 months away, so equity valuations would likely drift lower. At the same time, high spreads on investment-grade and high-yield bonds would limit mergers and acquisition activity and reduce stock buybacks, sapping other potential sources of demand for equities.</p><p> The incremental benefit of quantitative easing on economic growth appears to be declining, despite its big impact on asset prices since the Global Financial Crisis. Still, there&rsquo;s plenty of liquidity; the key risk is investor and consumer sentiment. We&rsquo;re monitoring: housing prices, growth and broader inflation indicators; currency moves in response to central bank rhetoric; and broad credit-creation measures.</p><h3> <strong>  2. European Bank Stress </strong></h3><p> <br/> If the European Central Bank raises capital requirements, it could cause European banks to retrench even more. This would reveal stress and create other damaging effects, including putting a dent in credit creation.</p><p> Credit creation, by European banks in particular, was critical to our assumption of a sustainable economic recovery in Europe, because of its impact on consumer spending and small-business creation. We view the Senior Loan Officer Surveys as a valuable indicator for assessing the resilience of credit creation in the face of tighter capital requirements for European banks.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Currency Challenges for China  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Policymakers are juggling three conflicting goals: reducing interest rates to stimulate growth and avoid a credit crisis, curbing capital flight, and keeping the currency stable.</p><p> At this point, capital flight is winning&mdash;China is using its official reserves to defend the yuan and provide liquidity to the banking system. If this continues and the Fed doesn&rsquo;t revive quantitative easing, it could affect demand for US financial assets. China insists its currency is safe, but we think devaluation could happen. Markets may decline initially, although the long-term trajectory could ultimately be to the upside.</p><h3> <strong>  Upside Catalysts </strong></h3><p> <br/> The recent decline in financial assets has created a negative wealth effect&mdash;in other words, it has reduced potential spending because of lower real and perceived wealth. It&rsquo;s also weighing on business and consumer sentiment. But equity valuations are still very attractive relative to those of short-term bonds, and there&rsquo;s a lack of traditional investment excesses that tend to drive market downturns.</p><p> We also see a few signposts that could indicate potential upside in equity markets. We think investors would embrace evidence of improving economic growth, helping to reverse recent losses. Here are three things to look for that could turn around economic growth and equity market performance:</p><h3> <strong>  1. The End of Inventory Correction </strong></h3><p> <br/> We believe that a good portion of the recent decline in growth comes from the headwind of business inventory de-stocking. On the flip side, when inventory corrections end, we tend to see sharp growth rebounds.</p><p> We monitor global inventory trends through corporate reports, and complete data for the fourth quarter of 2015 isn&rsquo;t available yet, data available to date suggest inventories continued to build. US government data also suggest that manufacturing and trade inventories grew ahead of sales. This could easily reverse in the next one to two quarters and show up as an acceleration in growth by mid-year.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Cheap Oil Benefits Are Fully Realized </strong></h3><p> <br/> So far, the market has interpreted the decline in oil prices as a negative because it impacts credit spreads and financing costs&mdash;and creates pain for oil-producing countries. But the benefit of cheap oil has a much broader reach. Consumers, for example, have more money to spend, with confidence the key to unlocking more consumption.</p><p> So far, they&rsquo;ve used much of the savings to pay down debt. That makes the next few months critical: there&rsquo;s growing rhetoric that lower oil prices are a permanent fixture, a belief that&rsquo;s necessary to boost consumption. We should see evidence of increased consumption in sales growth for stores and services that cater to lower-income consumers.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Race to the Bottom in Rates Spurs Activity </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is the most tenuous potential source. A growing circle of countries imposing negative interest rates could lead to ramped-up credit creation and demand for assets. Declining real estate capitalization rates and rising loan demand could be early signs.</p><p> If these trends don&rsquo;t materialize, it could usher in a transition to fiscal policy experimentation. But outside of oil-producing countries, virtually no country appears to be contemplating expansionary fiscal policy. We recognize that fiscal spending is moving from headwind to tailwind in most of the developed world, but we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s being considered as a meaningful weapon to drive inflation and growth.</p><p> These are a few of the scenarios and signposts that could help us determine the likely direction for risk assets.</p><p> For now, we think it makes sense to consider remaining somewhat underweight equities in multi-asset strategies. But it&rsquo;s not because of conviction about poor valuations or underlying economic fundamentals. Instead, it&rsquo;s about recognizing the impact of volatility and downside risk in the equity component on overall portfolio performance.</p><p> MSCI makes no express or implied warranties or representations, and shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to any MSCI data contained herein.</p>The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.",

    "content": "<p> Marketing serves a great many purposes for your brand and to help you grow your business. From common goals like increasing brand awareness and website traffic to more specific goals like generating x number of leads or earning however many more followers on Twitter. Marketing should support any number of initiatives tied to overall business goals and, when done right, can be a real game-changer for business success.</p><p> Content marketing, specifically, is a strategic marketing approach that is uniquely focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience &ndash; and, ultimately, drive profitable action ( <u>  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Content Marketing Institute  </a> </u> ). Well, within that definition is one of the most important elements of all marketing: audience. Audience is the single greatest asset of any and all marketing programs, because without an audience all the best marketing in the world is rendered useless.</p><p> For this reason, there is one very critical thing your marketing program better be doing. And if your marketing program isn&rsquo;t helping you do this one thing, than kiss your money goodbye, because it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll see a return on your investment anytime soon.</p><p> What on earth am I talking about?! What is that 1 thing your marketing MUST do?!</p><h3> <strong>  It Needs to Build Your Audience </strong></h3><p> <br/> The absolute number one thing your marketing program needs to do is build your audience. Think about it. When you have direct access to your audience, you have their ear &ndash; the potential for their valuable attention. You can communicate with them directly, personalize their experience with you and ensure that they are more likely to take the actions you desire that lead them closer to becoming a client or eventually amplifying your messages to their networks!</p><p> There are two specific areas to focus your audience building efforts:</p><li> Email Subscribers</li><li> Online Communities <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Email Subscribers  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Building an organic list of ideal clients is probably the single smartest thing you could ever do for your business. The digital landscape is constantly evolving and adapting to the demands of the consumer. It&rsquo;s realistic to believe that Google will find ways to make it easier and faster to access the information we search for, which may or may not benefit businesses. It&rsquo;s also realistic to anticipate that many of the social platforms we are using today will host more content rather than redirecting away from their platform to access it. I am no wizard and I can&rsquo;t see into the future, but what I can see is that audience attention is the crown jewel and it&rsquo;s a race for who can keep it. Just check out this article in Fast Company from a year ago  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3044187/fast-feed/the-other-shoe-drops-facebook-wants-to-host-news-sites-content-inside-facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Other Shoe Drops: Facebook May Soon Host News Sites&rsquo; Content Inside Facebook  </a> </u> .</p><p> Having a healthy email subscriber list of your own is a huge asset to your company and will ensure that you can continue to communicate with your ideal clients directly. Email proves again and again to be one of the most effective ways to engage with your audience and boasts the best response rates ( <u>  <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MailChimp  </a> </u> ). With your email subscribers, you can share new content and offers, communicate company updates, deepen your relationship with your subscribers with exclusive information &ndash; not to mention the invaluable ability to ask them for their feedback&hellip; on anything!</p><h3> <strong>  Online Communities </strong></h3><p> <br/> The other area your marketing program should be focused on is building your audience on social networks. For many of the same reasons as email marketing, your online social communities help you to get eyeballs on your content and engage with your audience. What social communities do particularly well is help to amplify your content beyond your audience&hellip; to your audience&rsquo;s network and so on and so forth. Your online communities empower your brand to reach beyond your first degree connections to potentially touch more ideal clients in the process and lead them back to your website.</p><p> This all assumes that you are  <u>  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/content-marketing/create-content-clients-will-love/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   crafting content your audience finds valuable  </a> </u>  and worthy of sharing! Remember: people share things that make them look good &ndash; so keep that little tid-bit in mind.</p><p> Having a large, quality online community of followers is invaluable to your brand. People will follow you because they like your brand and find some value from being connected with you. You are building trust with your ideal clients today and future clients of tomorrow. Reinforce a positive perception of your brand by who is associating with you. As you know, relationships are powerful and building strong online relationships of fans, followers and advocates will only help you and your business.</p><u> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The+absolute+number+one+thing+your+marketing+program+needs+to+do+is+build+your+audience.&amp;url=http://lmhinzmarketing.com/content-marketing/the-1-thing-your-marketing-program-better-be-doing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The absolute number one thing your marketing program needs to do is build your audience. </a></u><br/> <p> In all the many marketing activities you&rsquo;re getting into these days, be certain to have a marketing program that supports your ability to grow your audience. Having quality subscribers, fans, followers and advocates will absolutely supercharge any other marketing initiative and help you grow. Therefore, if you are going to invest in marketing, make sure your marketing efforts are delivering the type of return that actually counts.</p>",

    "link": "4-reasons-to-rethink-a-small-social-media-following",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> There&rsquo;s an unconscious belief built into our society telling us more is better. Social media is no different.</h3>When faced with a low social follower count, almost everything we do can revolve around boosting total followers.Post more content on our blog - so we can get more followers. Increase our daily tweets - so we can get more followers. Spend money to promote our posts - so we can get more followers.This type of behavior, however, can cause us to ignore the most important asset to any business: our people.Whether we have 15 or 15,000 followers, each of them (with the exception of spam) is a real life, breathing human.While a small following may seem like a weakness, it&rsquo;s actually quite the opposite. In fact, it&rsquo;s a pot of gold right beneath our noses. Here are four reasons why.<h3> <strong>  #1. They&rsquo;re Following You </strong></h3>Think of the shy, quiet kid in grade school nobody talked to. If you have a small social following, consider yourself that kid and your followers the folks that put their hands out to befriend you.They see your &lsquo;popularity&rsquo; but could care less.Says a lot, doesn&rsquo;t it? So what are you doing to thank them and, more important, deliver on what they expected?If you had thousands of followers, it would be easy to brush this off as too many people to reach out to. But with a small following, things are different...<h3> <strong>  #2. The Numbers Are Manageable </strong></h3>Social profiles with thousands of followers are, honestly, a lot of work. Usually a full-time social media specialist is needed to effectively build relationships, nurture these contacts, and reach business goals all at the same time.With just a few hundred followers, however, the numbers are manageable.You can easily work to build real relationships with each and every one of these followers. A quick glance at their profile will tell you plenty about their preferences and interests. Put on your Sherlock Holmes hat and you&rsquo;ll no doubt infer why they opted to get updates from you.Use this insight to start a conversation or offer more valuable content based on their individual interests. You&rsquo;ll find it infinitely easier to build a meaningful community of followers.As Ted Rubin states in<a href=\"/sell/marketing/be-truly-present-be-good-to-people\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> another post</a>, \"a network gives you reach, but a community gives you power.\"<h3> <strong>  #3. You Can Easily Gather Feedback </strong></h3>Ever email surveys to gather feedback from customers? Why not take qualitative research to the next level and personally reach out to followers for their input as well? This will not only make them feel valued, but it will give you the opportunity to build a stronger relationship.As Robert Cialdini describes in his classic book &ldquo;Influence: Science and Practice,&rdquo; once we make a choice, we feel a personal pressure to remain consistent with that commitment. Gathering feedback, whether it&rsquo;s for a new product or blog post, makes followers much more likely to engage with that content. This includes commenting, liking, and sharing the content they took part in creating.<h3> <strong>  #4. You Can More Effectively Grow Brand Advocates </strong></h3>A few years back Zeb Welborn of Welborn Social Media shared with me that the key to his success wasn&rsquo;t so much the hype and tactics spewed on the internet. Rather, he generated ROI for his clients through building real one-to-one connections.Social media was merely a tool used to make this happen.Follow Zeb&rsquo;s advice - start small, but aim to make a massive impact. This is how brand advocates are made.Yes, it&rsquo;s more labor intensive than the typical social media tactics out there designed for the 15,000+ accounts. When our follower count is low, however, we can either ignore our followers or we can take the glass half-full mindset.Don&rsquo;t get distracted by vanity metrics. You have the chance to blow away your followers and build the pillars to an engaged online community.",

    "content": "<p> This was something my brother-in-law, George, said at a recent cooking demonstration. George is a professional chef who owns and operates several restaurants. He is famous for his non-stop passion for food and cooking&mdash;even when he&rsquo;s not in one of the restaurants, he&rsquo;s judging a cook-off of some kind (most recently pho), researching historical recipes, or leading a cooking demonstration for us non-chefs.</p><p> The title quote was in reference to when he was plating a dish at a demo&mdash;elegant, but not precious. George followed up the remark with a quick &ldquo;not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that,&rdquo; as he holds sincere respect for most styles of cooking (and plating). What struck me about what he said, though, is that he knows what he is best at and what he is known for, and he sticks to it.</p><h3> In business (and in life) it can take years to figure out what you&rsquo;re best at, and what you&rsquo;ll be known for.</h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve seen many a start-up (including those of my own creation) try to be known for all things, the A-to-Z, and end up becoming disjointed and unfocused. If caught quickly enough, this be-all-things-to-all-people approach can be re-directed and narrowed down to the essence of what you offer, and to whom&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re a business owner or employee.</p><p> Pay attention to those moments when you a) get told you&rsquo;re a rock star or miracle worker, and b) you liked what you were doing when pulling off said miracles. Or follow these frequently offered tips for discovering what you&rsquo;re best at (and actually want to do):</p><li> <strong>  What are you doing when the time seems to fly by? </strong></li><li> <strong>  When do you feel &ldquo;in the flow&rdquo;? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What are you reading/doing when you&rsquo;re off the clock? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> The same can be said for focusing on tasks, especially for the founder of a start-up&mdash;you&rsquo;re pretty much doing everything at the beginning. What I&rsquo;ve learned from fellow entrepreneurs is to delegate the dreaded tasks as soon as it is economically viable to do so, then you can focus on what you do best and what will hit your revenue goals. Sometimes the best place to start with delegation for business owners is to find a really great accountant (unless you love accounting and excel at it, of course).</p><p> I recently &ldquo;re-grammed&rdquo; an image from James Victore on Instagram. It says &ldquo;To do: 1. Stay small.&rdquo; For many of us, &ldquo;stay small&rdquo; applies when you&rsquo;ve found the intersection of what you&rsquo;re really great at, and what you love to do (and that hopefully satisfies you financially as well&mdash;or if not, satisfies in some other way of personal fulfillment). Sometimes going beyond that can lead to all kinds of chaos (from rushing into a less-than-optimal business relationship, to becoming so unfocused you&rsquo;re not sure what to do next, and everything in between).</p><h3> Once we&rsquo;ve found that intersection, perhaps a new rule should be &ldquo;friends don&rsquo;t let friends pick up the metaphorical tweezers&rdquo; (no slap required, thank you!). </h3>",

    "content": "<h3> Picking a stock that goes up 100% in a year is exhilarating. But there&rsquo;s a problem with this method of investing. <br/>  </h3><p> Like gambling in Vegas, it may be fun and even rewarding in the short term. Yet in the end, just as the house always wins, picking stocks is a losing game.</p><p> I talk to friends all the time who say they invest in stocks &mdash; meaning individual ones rather than broad-based index funds that capture the movement of the entire market &mdash; and I always wonder why. I think many people see a company that carries a well-known name &mdash; maybe they are customers or they hear about it on the news &mdash; and they assume it&rsquo;s a good investment. But history has shown us time and time again that picking stocks of individual companies, and thus trying to determine which will be the winners, is not a good investment strategy.</p><p> No company is immune to short- or long-term failure, no matter how good they look in the moment. The company&rsquo;s value may not go to zero, but it could certainly take a huge hit relative to its underlying industry or index. Just think about how the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 index has changed in the past two decades. There has been a revolving door among the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500, proving that even the biggest companies out there are not immune to volatility and risk.</p><h3> Individual stocks vs. an index <br/>  </h3><p> As further evidence that picking stocks is risky and ultimately a losing game, consider recent research from financial firm JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. It compared the Russell 3000 index &mdash; which, as the company notes, &ldquo;represents approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market&rdquo; &mdash; between 1980 and 2014 with information on individual stocks. Here are the three main findings:</p><li> The risk of &lsquo;catastrophic&rsquo; failure among individual stocks is higher than you think. &ldquo;When looking at how often a stock has what we call a &lsquo;catastrophic decline&rsquo; &mdash; falling 70% or more and never recovering &mdash; we see that 40% of all stocks suffer this fate at some time in their history. And some sectors &mdash; like telecom, biotech and energy &mdash; saw higher-than-average loss rates,&rdquo; the report states.</li><li> Most stocks underperform over their lifetime. According to the report, &ldquo;The data shows that two-thirds of all individual stocks underperform over their &lsquo;lifetime,&rsquo; as compared to the Russell 3000. On average, the outcome for individual stocks was underperformance of about 50%.&rdquo;</li><li> Concentrated holdings in individual stocks add huge amounts of risk to your portfolio. &ldquo;When computing the optimal risk-adjusted return for a concentrated holder,&rdquo; the report notes, &ldquo;we find that 75% of concentrated stockholders would benefit from some degree of diversification.&rdquo;</li><h3> Why investors keep picking stocks <br/>  </h3><p> So why do so many individuals keep trying to pick stocks? I see two main reasons.</p><p> We all enjoy making money, and we don&rsquo;t usually associate the word &ldquo;boring&rdquo; with something we enjoy. That reason alone likely explains why so many people try to pick stocks. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; way to invest. But the research is clear that this is not an optimal strategy. When it comes to investing, &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; might as well be spelled &ldquo;sucker.&rdquo;</p><p> Rather, investing should be boring. It&rsquo;s like baseball: Base hits are the name of the game. By properly diversifying your investment portfolio &mdash; picking a mix of asset classes with exposure to many sectors and countries &mdash; with a long-term strategy, you allow yourself to take advantage of compounded gains without subjecting yourself to unnecessary risk (i.e., swinging for the fences).</p><p> The other major issue is that not all investors understand what they are doing. When you&rsquo;re stock-picking, you may think that you are diversified by owning five different stocks; but if that&rsquo;s all you own, you&rsquo;re exposing yourself to a huge amount of risk by having such a large percentage of your portfolio invested in just one stock or industry. One catastrophic loss could devastate your portfolio.</p><h3> Diversification <br/>  </h3><p> The logical question you might have is, &ldquo;OK, so what should I do?&rdquo; While answers are going to vary slightly for each individual, one applies across the board: Diversify. That doesn&rsquo;t mean owning many different individual stocks in the same sector, but rather spreading your investments throughout multiple asset classes, industries and countries. Proper diversification of your portfolio is key to your investing success over the long run.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Have you ever looked at your to do list and just laughed? You think, &ldquo;Oh right, that&rsquo;s not happening,&rdquo; and then moments later, you realize that none of the tasks on your list are really an option. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the point that your nervous laughter turns to tears. <br/>  </h3><p> That&rsquo;s the wall I hit this week. I&rsquo;ve had a number of serious personal challenges that require an intense investment of emotion and time, some stuff I wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen, and certainly not at a time like this, and other remarkable surprises filled with joy and hope.</p><p> And, I&rsquo;m neck-deep in the throes of the most intense and exciting time of my entire career.  We&rsquo;re starting our book tour for  <u>  <a href=\"http://winningwellbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Winning Well,  </a> </u>  and response has been tremendous. There&rsquo;s a constant flurry of speeches and media interviews to prepare for, and we head to Oregon next week to film for our forthcoming Winning Well online course.</p><p> Sure I took out Eisenhower&rsquo;s good old urgent and important matrix and mapped my priorities. The truth is, the urgent AND important box would make your hair curl. My closest friends and family are all saying &ldquo;You have every right to feel this way&hellip; even half of the list would feel impossible.&rdquo; Although that may feel strangely comforting, it doesn&rsquo;t actually make the list smaller.</p><p> So if you&rsquo;re reading this because you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed, know that I&rsquo;m right there with you.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing to cope. And it&rsquo;s helping. I hope it can help you too.</p><h3> 6 Ways to Stay Productive When You&rsquo;re Feeling Overwhelmed <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1) Identify Your Most Important Thing (MIT) </strong></p><p> In Winning Well, we write about the importance of identifying your MIT each day, &ldquo;At the start of each day look over your projects, tasks, and to-dos and identify the one item that is the MIT for that day.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2) Follow the &ldquo;Rule of One&rdquo; </strong> <br/> The Rule of One means that you give one thing at a time your full attention. When you need to change focus do so fully and intentionally. If you spend much time with C-level executives, you&rsquo;ll see that they do not multi-task. They focus. They&rsquo;re all in. Concentrating. They&rsquo;re confident their focus will make an impact. There&rsquo;s a reason they focus on one important task at a time. Give it a shot.</p><p> <strong>  3) Breathe </strong> <br/> Yes, that sounds clich&eacute;, and it is&hellip;if you keep breathing as a metaphor. But if you find yourself holding your breath as you&rsquo;re working your way down the list, I encourage you to stop, close your eyes and take five slow breaths in and out.</p><p> <strong>  4) Take a Walk </strong> <br/> Before you scream at your computer, &ldquo;Yeah, lady, I told you I don&rsquo;t have time already and now you want me to go for a walk?&rdquo; stay with me. This week I was feeling really blocked on the structure for an important speech I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;m committed to adding real value for the audience, and we&rsquo;re filming it, so I need to nail it to preserve the value for others as well. I was making myself insane staring at my computer writing and rewriting, and I just couldn&rsquo;t get the stories to flow to align with my message. I got in the car and drove to a trailhead with a blank piece of paper and a pencil. I walked without consciously thinking, and whenever I got a surge of inspiration, I wrote it down. At one point, I just stopped and sat on a rock and sketched out a brand new model that&rsquo;s perfect for this speech and others. Plus, I got to check off exercise from the list.  BAM!</p><p> <strong>  5) Ask For and Receive Help </strong> <br/> Look around, my guess is there are people offering to help. If not think about who you can ask. This can be tough for so many reasons&hellip; perhaps you think you can do it better, perhaps you want to be doing your fair share, or maybe you just don&rsquo;t want to feel out of control. I get it. I also know when you receive help, tasks go away. Our Winning Well toolkit is done and the Frontline Festival will run as scheduled, all without much intervention from me because I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to help from my co-author, <a href=\"http://trailblazeinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   David </a>  and my assistant,  <a href=\"http://www.bethbeutler.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Beth, </a>  when they said &ldquo;Just let me do this.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  6) Decide What Must Go </strong> <br/> After three years, of religiously writing a blog post three times a week, the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve gone down to one. Yes, I felt guilty. Sure I worried about letting folks down. But the truth is, bringing you strong, fresh content three times a week just isn&rsquo;t feasible right now. Better to take a step back and decide how to keep the blog adding value AND focusing on the rest of the list. <br/> <br/> People who are making an impact all feel overwhelmed from time to time. If you&rsquo;re in that season, don&rsquo;t spend time feeling frustrated and guilty. Take a deep breath, break it down, ask for help and work on what you know will make the biggest difference for your work and the people you care about.</p>",

There has never been a time in history where information has been more accessible and knowledgable people have been more prolific.</p><p> And you may have this same fear that many of us creatives go through&mdash;that the things you have to offer have already been done before.</p><p> I&rsquo;m talking specifically to bloggers here&mdash; or anyone who is trying to grow a digital platform around their passions and expertise. Understand this:</p><p> <strong>  No, you may not be saying anything new&mdash; but nobody has ever said it just like you. </strong></p><p> That rhymes, so it must be true!</p><p> Sure, there are plenty of experts, pundits, gurus and mavens who have shared the same concepts you may be working up. And yes, they have larger audiences than you.</p><p> Who cares?</p><p> If I let this stop me when I was getting started blogging and growing my own platform, I would have never made it past the first week. Between  <u>  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Hyatt  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://socialtriggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Darek Halpern  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gary Vaynerchuk  </a> </u>  alone I could have concluded that if they haven&rsquo;t covered what I want to say in some way already, they will eventually.</p><p> But do you know what I realized?</p><p> No matter how polished and prolific Michael is, no matter how smart and epic Darek&rsquo;s writing is and no matter how wildly popular and impressive Gary&rsquo;s stuff gets, they all lack one thing: me.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Nobody+on+Earth+has+your+unique+combination+of+experiences+%26+perspectives.&amp;url=http://bit.ly/1ptzNuA&amp;via=DustinWStout\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nobody on this earth has my unique combination of experiences and perspectives.  </a> </u></p><p> Read that line again, but make it a statement about yourself. And if you actually tweet that quote, you&rsquo;ll notice the &ldquo;my&rdquo; changes to &ldquo;your&rdquo;.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t worry if someone else has written it first. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many people have covered a subject, nobody has your perspective. Nobody has your views, your history, your experiences and therefore will never write about it in quite the same way that you will.</p><p> And look, no matter how internet-famous those experts and gurus get, you will always reach people that they will not.</p><p> Not only that, but you can say things that will relate to people in ways nobody else can. It&rsquo;s your unique makeup of experiences and perspectives that allow you to phrase things differently than others would.</p><h3> <strong>  Adding Your Unique Perspective </strong></h3><p> <br/> It can be really easy to get into a generic, matter-of-fact style of writing or storytelling that is uninteresting and undermines your unique perspective. So in order to make sure that you&rsquo;re using your biggest advantage, follow these basic rules.</p><h3> <strong>  Always know who you&rsquo;re talking to </strong></h3><p> <br/> Write for  <u>  <a href=\"http://dustn.tv/write-for-someone/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   someone specific  </a> </u> . This personalizes your message and allows you to speak with greater clarity. You might have a different idea of who you&rsquo;re talking to and this will dictate how you tell your story.</p><p> I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve experienced a time when you have one person trying to tell you something and it&rsquo;s just not sinking in for you, but suddenly another person puts it a different way and it all makes sense.</p><p> You can be that point of clarity that your friends, fans and followers need. But to accomplish this, you must know who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p><h3> <strong>  Add personal experiences </strong></h3><p> <br/> Dig deep into your own experience and show examples of what you&rsquo;re talking about in practice.</p><p> When I was a Sunday School teacher, I could give a fantastic 30-minute lesson full of ideas, examples, highly valuable insight and perspectives. But you know what my students always commented on more than anything else?</p><p> When I shared personal stories.</p><p> Not only do personal stories and experiences connect with your audience on a more intimate level, they also make what you say more memorable.</p><p> Humanity has used narrative over the centuries to pass down our knowledge, and our brains are much more receptive when we are able to connect to a real-life story.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Tell+a+story+from+personal+experience.+This+is+your+greatest+advantage+over+your+competitors.&amp;url=http://bit.ly/1ptzNuA&amp;via=DustinWStout\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tell a story from personal experience. This is your greatest strategic advantage over your competitors.  </a> </u></p><h3> <strong>  Leverage and improve related content </strong></h3><p> <br/> So someone else has written or talked about the topic you want to cover? Perfect! This is a fantastic opportunity to take what they&rsquo;ve said and expound upon it, filling in any gaps they may have left.</p><p> I learned this trick from  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chase_reeves\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chase Reeves  </a> </u>  of  <u>  <a href=\"https://fizzle.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Fizzle  </a> </u> . Here are two channels to strategically use for research to make your content better:</p><h3> 1. Blog posts.</h3><p> <br/> Find the blog posts that have been written before about the topic you want to write about.</p><p> After reading the article yourself, read through all the  <u>  <a href=\"http://dustn.tv/blog-commenting-systems/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   comments  </a> </u>  and see what people are resonating most with or, more importantly, what they&rsquo;re missing or asking questions about.</p><h3> 2. Books on Amazon.</h3><p> <br/> Find books on Amazon that are about your topic.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Is Asking for Referrals Right for You? <br/>  </h3><p> For professional services firms that are trying to increase business, referrals are the go-to source. In fact, our 2015 Marketing Priorities Study discovered that 62 percent of firms cite generating referrals as their highest marketing priority.</p><h3> So how do you get more referrals? <br/>  </h3><p> The business development pundits give the impression that, if you simply ask for referrals, they&rsquo;ll come tumbling in. But is this advice grounded in facts or teetering on the edge of faulty assumptions? It seems that many professionals are unsure of the answer to this question.</p><p> Despite all the advice, professionals are reluctant to ask for referrals. Often, they feel uncomfortable. It turns out, their gut feelings may be trying to tell them something. There are good reasons for their concerns.</p><h3> <strong>  Let&rsquo;s take a look at both sides of the &ldquo;Should you ask for referrals?&rdquo; fence </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> The Case for Asking for Referrals <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  It Makes Sense </strong></p><p> There&rsquo;s an adage, &ldquo;Ask and ye shall receive.&rdquo; It makes sense. How would your client know you want referrals unless you ask them? So ask.</p><p> <strong>  No Harm Done </strong></p><p> Okay, so not everyone you ask will make a referral, but it&rsquo;s a numbers game. Right? If they do not want to make a referral, no harm done. After all, there&rsquo;s another old saying etched in our minds&mdash;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to ask.&rdquo;</p><p> But, then again, there may be holes in this deep-rooted maxim too.</p><h3> The Case Against Asking For Referrals <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Professional Services Are Different </strong></p><p> While it may be perfectly acceptable for many salespeople to ask for referrals, it is often inappropriate for professional services providers.</p><p> Think about it. Should a bankruptcy attorney ask for the names of people who are mired in financial difficulties? There are issues of trust and ethics to consider. In some situations, direct solicitation can even be illegal.</p><p> <strong>  It Doesn&rsquo;t Work That Well </strong></p><p> When we dug into the data from our recent  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/referral-marketing-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Referral Marketing Study </a> , we discovered the &ldquo;&hellip;ye shall receive&rdquo; theory rarely applies to referral marketing. When we asked 1,100 professional referral sources whether they would be willing to make a referral if asked, only 2 percent  said they would.</p><p> Yikes, that is not very promising!</p><p> A 2 percent success rate may seem acceptable when you compare it to standards for a direct mail campaign. With direct mail, 1 percent is often seen as a success. But that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve already calculated that response level will generate a decent return on investment. The only risk is the cost of the campaign.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not as impressive, however, when asking for referrals because relationships are at risk. And relationships can be invaluable.</p><p> <strong>  Asking for Referrals Can Damage a Relationship </strong></p><p> When you ask for a referral, you&rsquo;re requesting a favor. If they feel uncomfortable referring you, it can put a client in an awkward position. Also, while they might comply, by asking for the referral, you have shifted the lens through which they view you. In their eyes, you are now a &ldquo;salesperson&rdquo; rather than a professional with their best interests in mind.</p><p> Do you want to gamble with your relationships for a 2 percent chance of a referral?</p><p> <strong>  Other Tactics Work Better </strong></p><p> Here is the good news the gurus are not telling you. Asking for referrals is not the only way to get them. There are other techniques. Even better, these techniques produce much higher success rates.</p><p> Our latest Referral Marketing Study discovered that making your expertise visible plays the single most significant role in driving referrals. More than 80 percent of firms receive referrals from people they have not worked with in the past. Almost all of their referrals (94.5 percent) are based on a firm&rsquo;s reputation and Visible Expertise.</p><p> You can  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/the-visible-expert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   become a Visible Expert  </a> </u>  by speaking, blogging and creating content in an array of formats. So, if you&rsquo;re uncomfortable asking for referrals, you don&rsquo;t have to do it. Simply show what you know.</p><p> <strong>  Finding the Right Balance </strong></p><p> As you seek equilibrium on the question of referrals, consider why people make referrals to professional services firms in the first place. First and foremost, they want to help a friend or colleague who needs a professional service.</p><p> They do it for the buyer, not the vendor.</p><p> So, by asking for referrals, we&rsquo;re trying to go against the current of how referrals happen. It&rsquo;s easier to flow with the current.</p><p> Understanding this dynamic is critical because it enables you to see how you need to do things differently to get referrals from clients&mdash;without asking. Of course, you need to have solid client relationships, but your clients also have to be aware of your firm&rsquo;s expertise, what you do and how it applies to client problems.</p><p> Yes, even with your own clients it comes back to Visible Expertise. When they know the problems your firm can help to solve, you&rsquo;ll naturally come to mind when a colleague asks, for example, &ldquo;Do you know a company that can help me to hire a new chief information officer?&rdquo; Then, they&rsquo;ll be able to make the appropriate referral.</p><p> Despite all I&rsquo;ve said that might tip the scales against asking for referrals, there are circumstances where you may be in a position to discuss your interest in gaining new clients. You can do this with clients as well as other professionals with whom you have a strong social relationship. Perhaps after you&rsquo;ve wrapped up a meeting and are chatting about your respective businesses. Or over lunch.</p><p> In those situations, you can express your desire to get referrals without putting the client on the spot. It could even be appropriate to request a specific introduction to someone they know.</p><p> But the watchword is appropriateness. Go with your gut. If you do not feel comfortable, forget the pundits and the adages. Asking for a referral may well be the wrong thing to do.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Should every company be striving for the form of strategic advantage that has become the hallmarks of Amazon, Google and Facebook? <br/>  </h3><p> For sure, in the tech world, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine success without quick and continuous technology improvement. What about your world?</p><p> Whether you sell information or cremation, the common thread for success is sustaining an advantage. The means to this end isn&rsquo;t limited to technology breakthroughs. There are all sorts of strategies and cultures that can bolster and sustain a company&rsquo;s supremacy.</p><h3> Intense Competition Remains a Fact of Life <br/>  </h3><p> Make no mistake; intense competitive rivalries remain a fact of life in most industries. How leaders address the challenge to create opportunities can be as different as night and day.</p><p> For example, a great poker player does not play the game the same way as would an astute chess player. Business leaders of the poker ilk value quick, prudent, and confident decision-making. They understand the risk of each play, but unlike chessmen, they sacrifice strategic contemplation and negotiation to establish themselves as nimble paragons of tireless execution. They put the pedal to the metal to get the job done, and they expect that modus operandi from their teams. The most successful leaders, leverage &lsquo;fast company&rsquo; cultures to achieve competitive advantage.</p><h3> Fast Companies Get Results <br/>  </h3><p> Fast companies deliver superior results to thousands of customers, retailers, restaurants, and service organizations. California-based In-N-Out Burger chain epitomizes this quick and nimble culture. Unlike competitive fast food restaurants, they deliver the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; in the category&rsquo;s nomenclature. In-N-Out Burger keeps it simple in order to deliver a great product, quickly. Their menu is limited to three beef burger offerings, fries, shakes and soft drinks. If you want chicken, salad, pizza or wraps, get out of the line-up to the counter and go elsewhere.</p><p> Equally nimble are some of the world&rsquo;s most successful private label brand manufacturers.</p><p> Store brands, particularly in the US are doing better than ever. In 2014, private labels generated $115 billion in sales, an increase of +2.5% over year ago &ndash; more than twice the gain of national brands.</p><p> While In-N-Out Burger thrives on doing less, private label manufacturers prosper by doing more. They have to do more (and do it better) because the secret to success in this business is a wide array of products and packages in countless shapes, sizes, and flavors at costs substantially below branded competitors. This is just an entry chit into the private label industry. Success comes from the ability to satisfy America&rsquo;s powerful retail chains with flexibility, service, pre-defined quality, all at the lowest price. This does not leave much room or time for these players to pioneer new technologies or develop their own brands.</p><h3> Pedal to the Metal Mentality <br/>  </h3><p> Companies who thrive on a fast culture are obsessed with reducing costs and improving operations. They don&rsquo;t use their precious time to strategically hypothesize or intellectualize. They map a course of action and hit the accelerator. From top to bottom, everyone knows what is expected.</p><p> These companies are known for their ardent attention to the details of day-to-day activity, but don&rsquo;t for a minute think they lack far-sightedness. Visions need not be so narrow that they are repressive. On the contrary, they are broad enough that employees who thrive on perpetual motion have the breadth to pursue and create wonderful new opportunities.</p>",

    "link": "in-depth-qa-how-to-avoid-private-student-loan-nightmares",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Privately financed college loans were less than 10 percent of the $1.3 trillion in unpaid student debt last year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. <br/>  </h3><p> The bulk of student loans are funded by the federal government. But the minority who borrow from private financial institutions often learn painful lessons after graduation: it is much more difficult to negotiate affordable repayment plans with private lenders. Private loans are unlike federal student loans, which have standardized repayment options and procedures.</p><p> The following article is intended to help parents and future college students avoid getting into difficult situations in the first place with private loans. </p><p> This Q&amp;A features interviews with two student loan experts at Clearpoint Credit Counseling, an Atlanta non-profit: Terrence Banks, a counselor who works directly with borrowers, and Thomas Bright, a blogger.</p><h3> Q: Graduates trying to renegotiate their private loans conveyed some harrowing stories in Clearpoint&rsquo;s 2013  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.clearpoint.org/blog/how-to-pay-off-private-student-loans-from-sallie-mae-and-other-lenders/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   blog post  </a> </u> . Have things improved since then? <br/>  </h3><p> Terrence: The complaints are still valid and still rampant. But some &ndash; not all &ndash; private lenders have stepped up to the plate to make private loans a bit more financially feasible.</p><h3> Q. What would you advise parents and matriculating students do when making their first borrowing decisions? <br/>  </h3><p> Terrence: Exhausting the federal loan option is paramount before you go to the private loans. If you find yourself in trouble where you can&rsquo;t make a payment, you have more options under the federal than the private loans. Also try to find out the potential income for your future profession before going down this road and borrowing at all. And then look for grants &ndash; there&rsquo;s a slew of grants that are untapped each year because people don&rsquo;t take the time to access them because student loans are so readily available.</p><h3> Q. How do borrowers get themselves into the situations like this one, described on your blog? &ldquo;I am able to consolidate my federal loans (big help on the monthly payments) but not my private loans.&rdquo; Borrowers also talk about inflexible private lenders and being harassed with phone calls from these lenders. <br/>  </h3><p> Terrence: People, when they take on these loans, aren&rsquo;t paying attention that they have to pay them back. Often, it&rsquo;s past the point of an individual being able to pay it off completely. Are they going to even be able to service the accrued interest? What&rsquo;s not being talked about is that these companies are institutions that make money, so I counsel people that a loan is not just to give you an education but to make a profit. Young people need more education before they take that on.</p><h3> Q. Given there is federal financing, why do people need private loans? <br/>  </h3><p> Terrence: The parents may not be there to qualify for some of the federal options. Also, because the cost of education has increased dramatically, borrowers may not qualify for enough federal loans to pay all of their tuition, which leads them into the private loans.</p><p> Thomas: One thing we&rsquo;ve heard on our blog is that sometimes students take out significantly more in student loans than they need to cover their living expenses or whatnot. We also hear about people using them for some extravagant items that aren&rsquo;t relevant to their college experience &ndash; that does get people in trouble too.</p><h3> Q. Given the prices of tuition these days, are the maximums allowed for federal loans adequate to cover most tuitions, without going into private debt? <br/>   </h3><p> Terrence: Yes, typically there is enough for a public university. When I talk to them, though, they say, &ldquo;I took out more than I needed.&rdquo;</p><h3> Q. In the 2013 blog post, why did you call private student loans a &ldquo;crapshoot?&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Thomas: It may be getting better, but I was putting myself in the shoes of someone who wanted to take out a private student loan at the time. How could I compare the differences? It&rsquo;s not easy to tell one loan from the other, and how different would my experiences be with different lenders? With federal loans, the rules are the same no matter who my servicer is &ndash; they&rsquo;re mandated by federal rules. But if you take out private loans, you&rsquo;re subject to, say, Discover&rsquo;s versus Sallie Mae&rsquo;s private loan terms. You can compare interest rates upfront but not the repayment plans and the flexibility they will offer in repayment later on. You might be lucky and get a lender with a flexible plan or you may not.</p><h3> Q. Can borrowers find out private lenders&rsquo; repayment options before they borrow? <br/>  </h3><p> Thomas: Companies are getting better, but for an average 18 year old, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to find that information. It&rsquo;s a big step even for a teenager to realize they need to compare interest rates &ndash; not only that, but what if I don&rsquo;t get a job after I graduate and how does that affect my repayment? That&rsquo;s financially complicated and out in the future, and I don&rsquo;t think a lot of young people are thinking that way.</p><h3> Q. In the blog, you often seemed helpless in advising graduates with private loans &ndash; in contrast to what you&rsquo;re able do about federal loans. Is that correct? <br/>  </h3><p> Terrence:  I totally agree. I struggled with how to respond because some of those people have given us very, very specific information about their income and monthly payments, and you realize very quickly they are in unrealistic circumstances. You&rsquo;ve got to call your lender. But if you do all those things and don&rsquo;t get offered any flexibility, it&rsquo;s a really tough situation to be in. I think refinancing your loans is such a great tool, if you can bring an interest rate down from 12 percent to 3 percent or 4 percent. That&rsquo;s a great piece of advice but unfortunately so many people in trouble aren&rsquo;t able to access that great tool, because they don&rsquo;t have good credit scores.</p><p> The good news is that, initially, I used to get a lot more calls based on private loans. But the large majority of loans now are federally based. When private companies service federal loans, however, it also complicates the repayment negotiations dramatically. I have a couple tomorrow. Navient is servicing both their federal and private loans, but the couple can&rsquo;t distinguish them. They have to know the difference since this servicer handles both.</p><h3> Q. What about students with jobs? Do they have more options? <br/>  </h3><p> Terrence: Yes. If they already have the jobs, I might steer them, based on their income, to improve that credit score and find a way to consolidate.</p><p> Thomas: Or refinancing might be the best option for private loans, but it&rsquo;s also hard to do if you don&rsquo;t have good enough credit or the right income level to qualify. There are programs out there like PAVE, which refinances using unusual criteria such as your earnings potential in the future.</p><p> An issue with private loans is that the lenders don&rsquo;t always have an incentive to point you toward what&rsquo;s in your best interest. That&rsquo;s because refinancing would mean going to another financial institution, and they don&rsquo;t want that. Federal loan servicers, on the other hand, are more likely to help you navigate the options available and determine the pros and cons of each option.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> You&rsquo;ve heard that money is power. The greatest money power comes when you have control over your own finances. And you can leverage that power to advance in many other areas of your life.</h3>You may be tempted to push this project to the back burner because, let&rsquo;s face it, managing money can be super boring. Ignoring your finances won&rsquo;t make them any better, but tackling them head on will. Your confidence and sense of security will soar when your finances are in better shape, and so will your cash flow.Getting on top of managing money that comes in and goes out is critical for successful single women. Whether you&rsquo;re single by choice, waiting for the right partner, divorced or widowed, with kids or without, you face some unique and pressing financial needs.The fact is more women are choosing the single life. The U.S. Census bureau estimates more than a third of women in the U.S. are now single, either by choice or by circumstance. The number of single adult Americans overall is at a record high as well. The Pew Research Center reports there are more unmarried American adults than those who married in 2014. Consider that back in the 1950s, only 20 percent of Americans were unmarried.If the trend continues, the ranks of singletons will just keep growing.Read on for the most important financial advice for women who are single, divorced or widowed, with and without children &mdash; and the priority actions you need to take now so that 2016 can be your year of money happiness.<h3> How single women can take control of their financial power</h3>You might be looking for the ideal life partner, be between relationships &mdash; or maybe you&rsquo;re not looking at all. Whether you&rsquo;re single by circumstance or it&rsquo;s simply your choice, you&rsquo;re not alone.As a single woman, you&rsquo;re probably working &mdash; hard. You already have a single mindset about your financial life. After all, it&rsquo;s your money, and you&rsquo;re used to handling the bills and making all the big-ticket investment decisions for yourself. Not having a partner has some obvious benefits, including total freedom. No big fights over who blew $1,500 on a sports bet versus buying a new sofa. (And oh, the joys of being able to scarf the occasional dinner over the kitchen sink!)Singlehood also comes with some not so obvious drawbacks, like not having a second opinion from someone who has just as much skin in the game as you do &mdash; someone who shares your goals and might be able to help support them.The single mindset can be a huge confidence booster, but some trends for single women point to some worrisome money vulnerabilities. For example, women aren&rsquo;t keeping up with men in saving and investing.Did you know men have 50 percent more money saved for their retirement than women do,<a href=\"http://money.com/money/3911377/retirement-401ks-women-men/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  according to one 2015 study</a> by mutual fund company Vanguard?Financial security is more important than ever for the many single women choosing to become mothers on their own. If you anticipate having a child on your own or already have one, you&rsquo;ll need to think extra hard about your financial security because you are your child&rsquo;s sole support.It&rsquo;s the small acts of saving and investing that play the biggest role in determining if you can live your desired lifestyle or end up a crazy cat lady, and that&rsquo;s even more urgent for single women. I have your attention now, don&rsquo;t I?<h3> Four things you really need to know about money as a successful single woman</h3><strong> 1. You will need a Plan B, a savings account to carry you through an emergency</strong>If you face an unexpected crisis like extended illness or job loss, you don&rsquo;t have another earner in the household. So it&rsquo;s imperative that you sock away money to cover at least six months of expenses. Put this somewhere like a money-market account, where you can access it without penalty at any time. If you&rsquo;re a mom, make sure you stash money to cover childcare costs if you need to look for a new job or face an illness, plus be sure to pay for your life and health insurance.<strong> 2. Don&rsquo;t let your debt drag you down</strong>Paying off debt is probably the single most important thing you can do to improve your finances. Talk about freedom &mdash; every dollar you can pay off enhances your sense of control and confidence in every aspect of your life, not to mention makes a positive impact on your credit score. First tackle high-interest debt, such as credit cards, but also budget for paying off student loans. And don&rsquo;t get in over your head with a bigger mortgage than you can afford. Racking up debt can make you feel guilty.<strong> 3. Take the reins on investing for retirement</strong>Single women have to rely on their own resources and can&rsquo;t lay claim to a portion of a spouse&rsquo;s retirement income, as married women can. Plus, women now live well into their 80s, which means you need to participate in every company-sponsored and/or tax-free retirement account you can. Make sure to take advantage of any employer matching &mdash; that&rsquo;s free money.<strong> 4. You need a Plan A, too</strong>There are many sources of help, ranging from financial planners to so-called robo-advisers (web based) and your own knowledge accumulated by reading and taking courses. I still recommend getting together annually for an assessment of your assets and debts with a qualified investment adviser, someone who charges only a fee versus commissions on stocks or other investments that he or she sells to you. You&rsquo;ll get feedback on whether you are adequately diversified and on track. This can give you that trusted second opinion.",

    "title": "Are You Guilty of Any of These Eight Client Pet Peeves?",
    "link": "are-you-guilty-of-any-of-these-eight-client-pet-peeves",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> During the past year, I&rsquo;ve interviewed a broad cross-section of client executives about &ldquo;relationship building from the client&rsquo;s side of the desk.&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> I usually ask them about pet peeves&ndash;behaviors that irritate them or, even, that destroy their trust.</p><p> I&rsquo;m amazed at the stories I hear from these senior executives about the irksome habits of the outside suppliers and advisors they deal with. Here are the most common ones that client executives complain about:</p><h3> 1. Bragging <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;ve had a number of very successful clients who made it a point to start their business development conversations and sales presentations with effusive praise&mdash;bordering on the grandiose&mdash;for their own growth and success. Several invariably started their meetings with a big chart showing how much faster they had grown compared to their competitors. Prospects often perceive this as obnoxious, however. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t brag and go on and on about YOU&mdash;turn the conversation rapidly towards MY issues,&rdquo; a top executive recently told me. Also, the success you describe may actually intimidate or scare off a prospective client&mdash;if you&rsquo;re growing 20% a year, they may worry that you&rsquo;re hiring inexperienced people and won&rsquo;t give them the attention they need! So be careful&mdash;convey your credentials more indirectly, through the examples you cite and the powerful questions you ask.</p><h3> 2. Walking through a slide presentation or brochure in the first meeting <br/>  </h3><p> Nearly every executive I have ever interviewed on this topic cites this as a pet peeve. Clients want to talk with you, not stare at PowerPoint slides for 30 minutes. Remember, great relationships are based on great conversations, not one person showing the other how much they know. How can you have an engaging, back-and-forth conversation when the other person is staring at slides that you are most likely reading to them? It&rsquo;s stultifying and gets in the way of establishing rapport and likeability.</p><h3> 3. Overselling <br/>  </h3><p> No one likes to be sold to&mdash;but we all like to buy. When you meet someone socially for the first time, do you start pitching them on your attributes? &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m very smart and successful, and quite gregarious&hellip;&rdquo; No, you establish rapport with them, find some things you may have in common, and build up trust as you get to know each other. Building a relationship with an executive in a professional setting isn&rsquo;t that different. Ultimately, you&rsquo;re trying to find an issue of mutual interest that you can engage around. Far more effective than &ldquo;selling&rdquo; is to learn about the other person&rsquo;s issues, be generous with your ideas, and add value in the conversation.</p><h3> 4. Asking tedious, clich&eacute;d questions <br/>  </h3><p> One top executive I recently interviewed on a panel said this: &ldquo;If you ask me boring questions, it&rsquo;s a turn-off&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wait to finish the meeting. But ask me really interesting questions, and you&rsquo;ve won me over.&rdquo; You often have to get some background information and ask a few close-ended questions, but move on quickly to open-ended, thought-provoking questions that no one else is asking. And don&rsquo;t ask all those clich&eacute;s that salespeople have been using for the last 25 years&mdash;things like &ldquo;What keeps you up at night?&rdquo; (&hellip;The traffic noise) and &ldquo;What would it take to get your business?&rdquo; (&hellip;Lower your price by 50%).</p><h3> 5. Being overly familiar <br/>  </h3><p> As one British executive told me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in with all this &lsquo;matey&rsquo; stuff and act like we are best friends after ten minutes. It&rsquo;s really off-putting.&rdquo; Be warm and friendly, but don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re suddenly friends. At best it&rsquo;s a turnoff, at worst it&rsquo;s kind of creepy. And remember, at the beginning of a relationship, ask questions about them as a person, but don&rsquo;t ask questions that are too personal (&ldquo;How have your first six months in this role gone for you?&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Tell me about your family&rdquo;).</p><h3> 6. Arriving unprepared <br/>  </h3><p>  My father used to tell me, &ldquo;There is no substitute for genuine lack of preparation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s true&mdash;a lack of preparation can uniquely convey a bad impression and make you look inept. Ridiculous, you might say&mdash;who would go unprepared into a meeting with a prospective or current client? Yet, I hear this from clients all the time. I repeat&mdash;all the time. But, remember, you don&rsquo;t have to spend hours preparing for every meeting. Sometimes, just 20 minutes of judicious reading and review of the client&rsquo;s annual report and website can help you glean a few interesting things to ask about and some thoughtful questions you&rsquo;d like to ask.</p><h3> 7. Going over their heads <br/>  </h3><p>  There are many reasons why we, as external providers/advisors, can feel the need to go over the head of our immediate client. It may be that we have a valuable idea to propose, but our lower-level client is not in a position, in terms of organizational responsibilities, to appreciate it or act on it. Our work-with client may actually be trying to control the relationship, and keep us from talking with other executives in the company. But going over a client&rsquo;s head is highly threatening to them and risky for us. It can be seen as a betrayal and also a belittlement. There are times to go over someone&rsquo;s head, but please do it only after a great deal of careful thought. And be prepared for the potential negative consequences.</p><h3> 8. Giving them recycled boilerplate <br/>  </h3><p> Every client I&rsquo;ve ever worked for feels their organization, culture, and business challenges are unique. They have always wanted me to take the time to understand them as a firm and make recommendations that are tailored for them. Even if you sell a product, different companies may use it in different ways and seek to achieve slightly different goals. In your proposals and during your ongoing work with clients, make sure you are treating your client as a unique market-of-one and not giving them boilerplate. Use their language, and frame your solutions in the context of their special world.</p><p> Are you guilty of any of these eight client pet peeves? At one time or another in my career, I&rsquo;m sure I have been. But that&rsquo;s all past history. The important thing is, going forward, to be aware of how these thoughtless habits can undermine your relationships and ensure you never get past the first meeting.</p>",

    "link": "four-questions-to-ask-yourself-to-determine-whether-you-should-be-leading-or-following",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Leadership is not a title or position; it&rsquo;s power, but not power in the sense that we usually think about power. <br/>  </h3><p> It is the power to inspire others to do more than they ever thought possible in the best interest of the greater good.</p><p> On the flipside, anyone can become a follower regardless of the position that they hold.</p><p> So, why would you ever want to follow if you can lead? The most effective leaders understand that they do not know everything, neither are they always the ones with the greatest influence. Being a great leader requires knowing when to lead and when to follow.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are four questions to ask yourself to determine whether you should be leading or following: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1) Can you see beyond the status quo? <br/>  </h3><p> While followers are often content with the status quo, leaders challenge the status quo. If you have a strange attachment to doing things the way they have always been done, it might be time for you to follow. If you are not open to change, it might be time for you to follow. Do you have blinders on? Are your biases jading your decision making? Is there someone on your team who thinks outside the box, who is creative, and thinks progressively? If you can&rsquo;t see beyond the status quo, it might be time for you to follow.</p><h3> 2) Are you focused? <br/>  </h3><p> Leaders often have so many things on their plate that it can be difficult to focus on one specific area. Is there a project that needs more attention than you are able to effectively give? Are you able to focus on developing your people? Is there a problem that needs to be resolved? Are there people on your team who can provide the needed attention to critical areas and issues? If you know you are unable to focus where needed, it might be time for you to follow.</p><h3> 3) Are you motivating others? <br/>  </h3><p> There are times when the formal leader lacks the vision and ability to motivate those around them. This does not make you a failure as a leader; it only leads to failure if you neglect to recognize that it might be time to follow. Are you passionate about a project? Are you motivated from within? Is there someone on your team who is really passionate about the project you are working on? Is their passion contagious and can they motivate others? You can&rsquo;t fake passion and motivation. If you are unable to motive others, it might be time for you to follow.</p><h3> 4) Are you confident? <br/>  </h3><p> We want those we follow to have confidence in themselves so that we can feel confident in them. But, no one person can be an expert in everything or possess every possible skill. Is there someone on your team who is a subject matter expert? Do they know the industry inside and out? Do they possess skills that you don&rsquo;t? As a leader, it&rsquo;s okay to put your confidence and trust in someone who is more qualified for a task or assignment than you are. If you are not confident, it might be time for you to follow.</p><h3> Know When it&rsquo;s Time to Follow <br/>  </h3><p> Regardless of your position, if you cannot see beyond the status quo; if you can&rsquo;t focus; if you are unable to motivate others; and if you lack confidence, it may be time for you to follow. When you have a team member who would be better at challenging the status quo, someone who can focus on a project, someone who can motivate others, or someone who has the necessary confidence and competence, it&rsquo;s time for you to follow. Great leader know when to lead, but even more important, they know when to follow.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Making a lot of money in sales isn&rsquo;t easy, even when you use a personal sales assistant like  <u>  <a href=\"https://spirohq.com/home/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Spiro  </a> </u> . If it was then everyone would be doing it. Not everyone can handle the pressures of the job, and many of those who give it a shot end up quickly leaving with their tail between their legs.</p><p> So why do some people thrive in sales jobs while others go down in flames? <strong>  Here are the ten main reasons why some salespeople fail: </strong></p><h3> 1. Not listening enough</h3><p> <br/> Being a good listener is probably the most overlooked sales skill of all. Many sales reps spend far too much time talking, and nowhere near enough time listening to what the customer truly wants. If you listen attentively, and pay attention, the customer will tell you everything you need to know in order to close their deal.</p><h3> 2. Not understanding the value proposition</h3><p> <br/> Sales is all about creating value. Many sales reps don&rsquo;t understand this concept, and instead try to pressure the customer to complete the transaction instead of building up the value of whatever it is you&rsquo;re selling in the customer&rsquo;s eyes. In order to build value, you must understand what your product offers that creates that value.</p><h3> 3. Inconsistency</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;ve ever worked in sales, you&rsquo;ve almost certainly worked with sales reps who go from the top of the board one month to struggling for deals the next, part of a vicious cycle. Those who last in sales understand that producing consistently is the key to a successful sales career, and that constant ups and downs can make sales feel more stressful than it already is.</p><h3> 4. Being too timid</h3><p> <br/> While the fast-talking, overbearing salesperson annoys most customers beyond belief, a timid salesperson won&rsquo;t last longer than a few months in the profession. If you&rsquo;re scared to call people, too shy to approach them, and don&rsquo;t have the courage to ask for the business, you might as well dust off your resume and start searching indeed.com for a new job.</p><h3> 5. The sales cycle is a bad fit</h3><p> <br/> An often overlooked factor when looking for a sales job is whether or not the sales cycle is a good fit for a particular sales rep. Selling a car to a customer can take a few hours, while selling telecom services to an enterprise client can take months or longer from start to finish. Some sales reps thrive on the quick sale, while others can handle a longer cycle.</p><h3> 6. Lack of follow-up</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s amazing how many sales reps give up after only one or two follow-ups to a lead, or a prospect that they&rsquo;ve already pitched. Research has shown that it typically takes between 8-12 follow-up calls to close a deal, so sales reps who don&rsquo;t hit those numbers are doing themselves and their sales careers huge disservice.</p><h3> 7. Focusing too much on the negative</h3><p> <br/> There can be a lot to complain about in sales; the leads aren&rsquo;t any good, the industry is in a downturn, the comp plan changed for the worst. It&rsquo;s easy to complain, but it gets you absolutely nowhere. Successful sales reps put aside all negativity and excuses, and make things happen. The leads are bad? Go out and find prospects yourself. The comp plan changed? Sell twice as much! No one has ever gotten to the top of any sales organization by complaining.</p><h3> 8. Not setting daily goals</h3><p> <br/> Every salesperson has a sales goal that&rsquo;s set by the company. But not every salesperson sets achievable daily or weekly goals for themselves in order to achieve that bigger goal. If you want to close a certain number of deals per month, it will take measurable daily activity to get there: prospecting, calling, pitching, and following-up. If you don&rsquo;t get in the habit of setting smaller consumable goals, you won&rsquo;t come anywhere near hitting the bigger ones.</p><h3> 9. Not knowing the product and competition</h3><p> <br/> To succeed in any industry, you absolutely have to understand your product inside and out, as well as what your competition is offering that you aren&rsquo;t, and what you&rsquo;re offering that they&rsquo;re not. Sure, you could try to get by on likability and wit alone, but the smart buyers that you&rsquo;ll inevitably run into will make the difference between being at the top of the board or somewhere towards the bottom.</p><h3> 10. They don&rsquo;t embrace being a salesperson</h3><p> <br/> Possibly the biggest reason why some people don&rsquo;t last long in sales is that they never embrace their profession. The general public doesn&rsquo;t value salespeople as much as they should, and some people can never get past that. The best salespeople embrace their position and own it, understanding the role they play for their companies and their families, at the front lines of the workforce. To put it simply; the best salespeople love what they do.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Much has been written that we are hard wired for dependency - the type of dependency in intimate relationships that is natural, healthy, and mutually beneficial. However, too much dependency can create codependency.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/signs-of-a-codependent-relationship\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Co-dependency  </a> </u> on another fosters behaviors that can be dysfunctional, unhealthy, and destructive. It puts pressure another person to be 'their everything' to fulfill their needs and increase their self-esteem. No one is capable of that. Yet, having a relationship with too independence and living parallel lives while under the same roof isn't the answer either. These couples may not spend all that much time together. They are busy doing their own thing, and don't turn towards each other in times of stress. They have become successful at the 'business' of marriage. So, creating the balance between the two is essential to creating a healthy relationship.</p><p> When creating a healthy relationship, keep in mind that it should be one that is interdependent - not dependent or independent. This provides the foundation and the strength needed for a healthy relationship to evolve. For this to develop, key traits should be present.</p><h3> <strong>  1. They have autonomy. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Simply put - they function independently. They are their own person within the couple. They engage in activities outside of the relationship they enjoy - spending time with friends, hobbies, volunteering - whatever it might be that brings them happiness without worrying how it will affect their relationship. This gives each person time away from one another, to miss one another, have new things to talk about, while concurrently enhancing their own self identity and cultivating their own interests. Each person encourages and supports their partner&rsquo;s interests and don&rsquo;t feel threatened by them.</p><h3> <strong>  2. They manage their own sh*t. </strong></h3><p> <br/> They don't rely on the other person to take care of them (in a dependent kind of way), expect them to manage their feelings (think impossible and a black hole) or believe that their spouse or partner's responsibility. They take responsibility for their own feelings, thoughts, and actions and know they are responsible for the relationship. They take care of themselves but also know when they need a help, support, guidance, direction. They are able to turn towards their partner knowing they will receive this in return. They make a 100% contribution to the relationship.</p><h3> <strong>  3. They encourage the best version of each other. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Each person strives to be their best version and their partner supports, applauds, and delights in their successes. They don&rsquo;t begrudge them when are successful or are jealous. They are truly happy for their partner and remain committed.</p><h3> <strong>  4. They respect their partner&rsquo;s alone time. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Each person respects the other's desire to spend time alone (and without friends) doing what they need - if this helps them to decompress, reboot, and feel centered again. Their sense of independence is not a threat to the relationship. They both recognize the need of that in each other. They value the importance of separateness. They view their similarities and their differences as strengths. </p><h3> <strong>  5. They have healthy  <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/sindex/f/what-is-self-esteem.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   self-esteem.  </a> </strong></h3><p> <br/> Their self-esteem is not dependent on how their partner feels about them. They are able to independently esteem themselves, understanding that sometimes it will ebb and flow, but they still feel good about themselves and know they are the only person that can do this for them.</p><h3> <strong>  6. They create &lsquo;space&rsquo;. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Couples recognize that the greatest gift they give to one another is the space that exists between them. They have learned that this is where their relationship grows. They have cultivated and nurtured this aspect of their relationship. They don't feel threatened or insecure when they are not together. They both have become comfortable with this space, which allows them both quiet and individual time, for self-reflection and growth. They recognize the space provides an opportunity to continue to build and thrive as a couple. Their relationship comprises time together and time apart.</p><p> These are some of the things that couples do to encourage a healthy, balanced, and integrated relationship. They don't sacrifice self for another, but they do things that help their relationship grow and thrive.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In my professional life, part of my role as a manager is to ask for help.  <strong>  I ask my team for help all the time &ndash; except it&rsquo;s called delegation and it&rsquo;s in the job description. </strong></p><p> And it doesn&rsquo;t sound so helpless.</p><p> In single-working-mother world though, delegation only exists when I ask the kids to set the table, feed the cats or do any number of chores.</p><p> Outside of that, my sense has always been that the responsibility falls on me and asking for help simply feels unacceptable. Taboo.</p><h3> The &lsquo;h&rsquo; word itself chokes me.</h3><p> <br/> Asking for help feels like some sort of failure &ndash; like I&rsquo;m single-handedly supposed to be able to manage it all. The rides. The homework. The activities. The meals. All of it.</p><p> So when the 2015-2016 school year started and my boys were suddenly inundated with sports, social activities and clubs, it meant that I, too, was inundated. And defeated.</p><p> I panicked at the very thought of potentially having to leave work early four days a week.</p><h3> My solution to the problem seemed simple enough.</h3><p> <br/> I immediately started looking to fill the need by building a ride-share business for school kids. Seriously. I looked to see if anyone else was doing something similar (there is) and quietly started to build my own business model.</p><p> My business plans drew to a halt, however, when all of a sudden, my significant other and friends whose kids were in the same activities stepped forward and offered to help as much as possible. It was that easy.  It was uncomfortable at first, but I accepted the help and offer up my extreme gratitude on a regular basis.</p><h3> I even ask for help now when I need it. Shudder to think.</h3><p> <br/> But taking advantage of the help that&rsquo;s out there for us doesn&rsquo;t just elude us Moms&hellip; In the working world, professionals young and old don&rsquo;t necessarily have trouble asking for help, but do have trouble reacting to the help offered to them.</p><p> &ldquo;One of the big issues I find today is that people don&rsquo;t listen to experience. They want you to help them, but when you offer suggestions, they don&rsquo;t want to do what you&rsquo;re suggesting. They would rather argue with you than take your advice,&rdquo; said Michael Curry, three-time Emmy award winning sound engineer, Head of Audio for MLB and NHL Networks in a recent conversation about our careers.</p><p> I find this attitude to be true of my kids too, and I hope to break this habit now while they&rsquo;re still young and impressionable.</p><p> Regardless of whether you are a single parent, a seasoned professional or someone just starting in your career, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help&hellip; but more importantly, be open to it when it&rsquo;s given. There is no greater lesson in life than what experience has to offer.</p>",

This primer will attempt to reboot your introduction to Bitcoin and convey some of the reasons why many in the financial and technology sectors are excited about its promise. A glossary of common terms appears at the end of this primer. <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/bitfury-digital_assets_on_public_blockchains-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Digital Assets on Public Blockchains White Paper   </a>  </u> </strong>  by the BitFury Group, March 2016 [37 pages]This paper puts in perspective why everyone is so excited about the possibilities of blockchain.Abstract: Digital asset management is one of promising applications of blockchain technology. Blockchains could provide principal disintermediation between digital asset issuers, application developers and consumers and decouple tasks related to asset management, such as issuance, transaction processing, securing users&rsquo; funds and establishing users&rsquo; identities. This paper outlines basic components of blockchain-based asset ledgers, as well as their use cases for financial services and for emerging Internet of Things and consumer-to-consumer markets. We describe existing and prospective deployment models for asset ledgers, including multi-asset blockchains, colored coin and metacoin protocols. This paper focuses primarily on Bitcoin-based services and, to a lesser degree, on public blockchains in general. <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"https://www.gfsi.ey.com/media_files/document/journal/3%20EY_GSFI_Journal_V3-I3_Sharing_Ledgers_final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Sharing ledgers for sharing economies: an exploration of mutual distributed ledgers   </a>  </strong> </u>  (aka blockchain technology) by Professor Michael Mainelli and Mike Smith of Z/yen Group for the EY Global Financial Services Institute, November 2015 [47 pages]I cannot leave out a paper written by one of the foremost authorities on what is happening here.Abstract: Mutual distributed ledgers (MDLs) have the potential to transform the way people and organizations handle identity, transaction and debt information. MDL technology provides an electronic public transaction record of integrity without central ownership. The ability to have a globally available, verifiable and untamperable source of data provides anyone wishing to provide trusted third party services, i.e., most financial services firms, the ability to do so cheaply and robustly. Blockchain technology is a form of MDL. The InterChainZ project was a consortium research project to share learning on MDLs during the summer of 2015. The study found that InterChainZ showcased several distributed ledger configurations and numerous variants, exploring how they might work in a set of agreed &ldquo;use cases.&rdquo; The outputs were a series of functioning, interlinked MDLs along with software, explanatory materials and website information. The research consortium concluded that MDLs incorporating trusted third parties for some functions had significant potential in financial services, such as know-your-customer (KYC), antimoney-laundering (AML), insurance, credit and wholesale financial services. <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324209739_UNDERSTANDING_BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY_AND_HOW_TO_GET_INVOLVED\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Blockchain: understanding the potential   </a>  </u> </strong>  by Barclays Bank&rsquo;s Simon Taylor, July 2015 [5 pages]I&rsquo;ve just put this in because Simon&rsquo;s a mate.Abstract: Bitcoin, heralded by many as the single biggest breakthrough since the arrival of the internet, has proved to be something of a moving target since its launch in 2009. However, it continues to be the focus of significant investment and innovation with the industry predicting that more than $1 billion in venture capital funding will have been invested in bitcoin and its future by the end of 2015.  Recent developments include BitPesa, a Nairobibased start-up focusing on bitcoin remittances, which raised over $1 million earlier this year and Earthport, which agreed a partnership with Ripple Labs allowing real-time cross-border bank payments But, it is becoming increasingly clear that bitcoin is part of an even bigger story: financial institutions, including Barclays, are now considering how the technology underpinning digital currency &ndash; commonly called &lsquo;the blockchain&rsquo; or &lsquo;blockchain&rsquo; &ndash; could in itself revolutionise finance. While many of these potential applications are medium term the development cycles in the industry mean that now is the time for companies to begin asking how this technology could benefit them. <strong>  <u>   Blockchain Technology and Applications from a Financial Perspective  </u> </strong>  by Unicredit, February 2016 [34 pages]Nice overview of financial use cases including payments, KYC, trade finance, clearing and settlementAbstract: This article aims at presenting potential financial industry blockchain applications leveraging UniCredit laboratory experience. Proposed vision promotes cross-effort and collaborative relationship amid financial institutions and fintech startups as blockchain initiatives&rsquo; critical success factors. Wide adoption of blockchain technology has the potential of reshaping the current financial services technical infrastructure. The change is expected to bring with it benefits to the existing business processes through removal of intermediaries, flat data structures that will reduce the lags of reconciliations among different local ledgers, compressed confirmation times and near real-time settlement of transactions. Moreover, there are underlying technical aspects of the blockchain which will provide data and transaction immutability, resiliency against cyber-attacks and fault tolerance. Formerly, blockchain technology is introduced from both a technological and a functional point of view. Then, financial use cases are proposed, showing financial industry impacts and benefits. <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/t20151002T010405__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Dualpub_22/Accenture-Banking-Distributed-consensus-ledgers-payment.pdf#zoom=50\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    The role of distributed consensus ledgers in the future of digital payments   </a>  </strong> </u>  by Accenture, September 2015 [20 pages]It&rsquo;s a good insight into the specific use case of payments.Abstract: The global rise of Bitcoin has introduced the world to cryptocurrencies, distributed consensus ledgers (DCLs) and blockchains. DCL technology has the potential to enhance efficiency, trust, transparency, reach and innovation in the financial markets. And while there are many other use cases &ndash; including in securities and capital markets &ndash; payments is one of the areas where DCL may prove most valuable.  There are clear reasons why DCLs can make a difference in the digital payments space compared to existing technology. They enable democratic, distributed, evenly-balanced control to be exercised in situations where it&rsquo;s currently not possible or easy, such as international payments. DCLs also go beyond the capabilities of existing technology by providing transparency where it has previously been difficult to achieve, such as in anti-money laundering (AML).It is also worth pointing to this research note by Larry Tabb on the subject,  <strong>  <u>   <a href=\"https://research.tabbgroup.com/report/v14-009-blockchain-clearing-and-settlement-crossing-chasm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Blockchain Clearing and Settlement: Crossing the Chasm   </a>  </u> </strong> .Finally, I really liked this note as it talks specifically about one of my favourite Fintech hubs: Tel Aviv. <u>  <strong>   <a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/il/Documents/financial-services/israel_a_hotspot_for_blockchain_innovation_feb2016_1.1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Israel A Hotspot for Blockchain Innovation   </a>  </strong> </u>  by Deloitte, February 2016 [33 pages]Interesting to see a review of a City getting plaudits for its many Fintech and now Blockchain capabilitiesAbstract: For more than a decade Israel in general, and the city of Tel Aviv in particular, has positioned itself as a global leader for innovation and of the faster growing hotspots for technology. Israel is mostly known for its rich ecosystem and ability to produce disruptive and cutting-edge innovations.  The Israeli technology industry has turned into an economic success story by both local and international standards.  Israel has the highest concentration of technical companies outside of Silicon Valley and the highest number of NASDAQ-listed technology companies, after the U.S. and China. Also, Israel&rsquo;s technology industry accounts for 15.7% of the country&rsquo;s GDP.</p>",

    "title": "How Relationship Marketing Can Increase ROI",
    "link": "how-relationship-marketing-can-increase-roi",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Most businesses don&rsquo;t have a clear understanding of what relationship marketing is and how to successfully put it into practice.</h3><p> <br/> A common misconception is that the relationship marketing blueprint is all about social media. Some people may believe it&rsquo;s opposite from traditional marketing and it even excludes older channels like email marketing.</p><p> That&rsquo;s simply not true.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve come across several business professionals who have separate opinions about social media and &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; marketing. They believe social media has everything to do with building relationships, and that traditional marketing channels are used for selling. Believe it or not, both channels complement one another.</p><p> One important business principle regarding customers is that it&rsquo;s more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to keep existing customers. With this in mind, is it more beneficial to prioritize relationship building or sales?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into relationship marketing.</p><h3> <strong>  The Relationship Marketing Blueprint </strong></h3><h3> <br/> What is Relationship Marketing?</h3><p> <br/> TechTarget defines relationship marketing as a customer relationship management strategy designed to encourage strong, lasting customer connections to a brand. It is a facet of customer relationship management (CRM) that focuses on customer loyalty and long-term customer engagement rather than shorter-term goals like customer acquisition and individual sales.</p><br /><p> As shown above, the goal of the relationship marketing blueprint is to create strong, emotional, customer connections to a brand that can lead to ongoing business, free word-of-mouth promotion, and insights gleaned from customers that can generate leads.</p><h3> How Relationship Marketing Can Increase ROI.</h3><p> <br/> Naturally, there is an increase in profitability associated with relationship marketing.</p><p> Here are the most significant factors:</p><li> <strong>  Increases Customer Visits. </strong>  People like to do business with whom they know and trust. There is a reason why we all shop at locations where we are most comfortable. It&rsquo;s the relationship we have with the business or sales rep that keeps us coming back.</li><li> <strong>  No Need to Date. </strong>  Just like our personal relationships, if you keep someone happy they&rsquo;ll have no reason to look elsewhere. A valuable relationship with a brand makes it easier to shop. There is already an established connection that will make the purchase process easier as both brand and consumer are familiar with one another.</li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s Cheaper to Keep&rsquo;em. </strong>  One principle you&rsquo;ll learn in any MBA program is that the cost of acquiring a new customer is more expensive than keeping your current customers. Based on this principle, it&rsquo;s evident that you&rsquo;ll increase your ROI when implementing a relationship marketing strategy.</li><li> <strong>  Expansion Becomes Easier. </strong>  Your loyal customers are more likely to purchase your ancillary products and support new ventures. Once you have built a relationship, you have your customer&rsquo;s attention. Leverage that attention when launching new products or services.</li><li> <strong>  Increases Word-of-Mouth. </strong>  Strong relationships cause your customers to happily refer your business to their friends. As a result, their friends certainly will consider your business as the referral came from a trusted source. <br/>  </li><p> The key is to prove yourself useful to customers who may not want a relationship with your business (outside of your product of course).</p><h3> <strong>  Use These Channels for Your Relationship Marketing Strategies. </strong></h3><h3> <br/> Customer service</h3><p> <br/> The foundation to providing great customer services is built on reciprocity and personalization. Equip your customer service representatives with clear goals and guidelines without suffocating them with red tape. Based on my experience, I notice that companies with exceptional customer service make it a priority to invest in employees who understand the importance of customer retention.</p><h3> Content Marketing</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  A Sale Will Make A Customer Today. A Relationship Will Make A Customer For Life. </strong></p><p> This underscores the importance of using content marketing to enhance your relationship marketing efforts. Content marketing will enable you to build long lasting relationships with customers. By offering free resources first, like how to videos,  <u>  webinars </u> , and helpful documentation, you will start your relationship marketing on the right foot.</p><br /><p> As the HubSpot diagram displays above, by publishing the right content in the right place at the right time, your marketing becomes relevant and helpful to your customers.</p><h3> Social media</h3><p> <br/> If you have read my blog before you should know that social media is a great tool for building relationships with customers. Particularly, traditional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has evolved to Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM).</p><br /><p> The chart above details the dynamic of this transition. Hopefully, it provides enough insight to explain how social media is a great tool for relationship marketing. See how it applies to your business. Are you set up to successfully transition from CRM to SCRM?</p><h3> Email</h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a reason social networks ask for your email when you sign up. Email is still a good way to turn your audience into customers, and it provides a nice ROI when compared with other digital channels.</p><br /><p> Customers, for example, are more focused on your email messages than a message on Facebook. Further, the delivery of your email message is not dependent on making its way through social media algorithms. As long as the company email address is associated with the email message sent, it&rsquo;ll certainly find its way to your customer&rsquo;s inbox.</p><p> Unlike social media, all of this can happen without your customer being distracted by memes, cat photos, and prank videos.</p><p> Although some prank videos are hilarious!</p><h3> Loyalty Programs</h3><p> <br/> As with every aspect of relationship marketing, creating a loyalty program starts with knowing what your customers want and what they&rsquo;ll do to get it.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a chart that displays popular loyalty programs and benefits.</p><br /><p> I&rsquo;ll be honest by saying that customer loyalty programs may seem far-fetched to the average business, but make no mistake &mdash; they work!</p><h3> <strong>  Final Thoughts </strong></h3><p> <br/> As you have read, the relationship marketing blueprint can increase your ROI. Your business can use customer service, content marketing, social media and email to develop long lasting relationships.</p><p> If you have ever dated in your life, you&rsquo;re quite familiar with the saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cheaper to keep her (or him)&rdquo;.</p><p> Well, when talking about customer retention, this is certainly true. Since it&rsquo;s more expensive to acquire new customers than keep current customers, you should prioritize the relationship over the sale.</p><p> Once you agree with that statement, start establishing a relationship marketing blueprint for your organization. When executed correctly, you certainly will see an increase in ROI.</p><p> What would you prefer to build, the relationship or the sale? </p>",

    "title": "Are You Disengaged With Work or Personal Life? You're Aren't Alone",
    "link": "are-you-disengaged-with-work-or-personal-life-youre-arent-alone",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Every one of us has either personally felt the pain of knowing they weren&rsquo;t fully engaged at work or at home (or both), has an important person in his or her life experiencing this or perhaps manages a team that is struggling with disengagement.</h3>While I&rsquo;ve always believed this to be true, it really hit me over the head, literally, just how big a problem this is.Two years ago I was on a business trip flying from my home in San Francisco to a client in Salt Lake City. I was on a small commuter plane that had a two and two seat configuration. I was getting comfortable in my aisle seat when a gentleman who had the window seat next to me approached. He had stopped to put his small bag in the overhead compartment when the laptop computer he was holding slipped and hit me in the head!Thankfully it was just a glancing blow and no blood was drawn, but he was very upset and wanted to make sure I was okay. After assuring him I was fine, we entered in to some small talk before the flight took off.During the trip at some point he opened up his computer to work and when glancing over I saw the logo from my former company pop up on the screen. I asked if he worked for them and he said 'no,' but rather that he was a videographer for an advertising agency and they were a client of his. He then asked me if I worked for them and I explained that I was one of their retirees and was currently working on my first book about employee disengagement and interviewing people who experienced the pain of this.My lovely seatmate, who was a white male about 35 years old, then pulled out his business card and said, &ldquo;you need to talk to me, I&rsquo;m going through this now as I try and figure out what&rsquo;s next&rdquo;.We exchanged cards and he went back to work and I to reading my magazine. A few minutes later I feel a tap on my right shoulder from my across-the-aisle seatmate.This time it was a charming African American woman in her mid 40&rsquo;s and she leaned over and whispered that she didn&rsquo;t mean to eavesdrop, but she wanted to give me her card as well.She told me that she had realized she was so disengaged that she asked for a transfer to a new job with her company and was moving from Salt Lake City to San Francisco. When I asked her what she did and who she worked for she put a finger to her lips to silence me and pointed to the pin on the lapel of her shirt. It was from the airline we were flying on!When we arrived at our destination a number of us were standing in the jet way to wait for our bags.A beautiful white woman in her 60&rsquo;s came and stood next to me and told me she didn&rsquo;t mean to eavesdrop either but was sitting behind me on the plane. She said the conversation resonated with her because she had just taken early retirement when she realized she had also lost the passion for what she did and knew she was disengaged.As I got my bag and walked toward my rental car I laughed to myself and thought what if I had gotten on a microphone on the flight and asked who else wanted to share their story with me. I think it might have been a large percentage of the passengers.This experience showed me that disengagement truly doesn&rsquo;t discriminate. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are a secretary, a manager or a C-suite executive. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are African American, Hispanic or Caucasian. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are young or old. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you live in the city or in the country.With 69% of the U.S. workforce and 87% globally identifying themselves as disengaged, it&rsquo;s bound to happen that someone sitting next to you is feeling the pain of this epidemic. We just don&rsquo;t always know it because it&rsquo;s normally a silent disease.Who said flying isn&rsquo;t educational and eye opening? This trip certainly was for me!",

    "content": "<p> Written by <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/about-us/affiliates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ruthann P. Lacey  </a> </u></p><p> As a society when we hear the term &ldquo;elder abuse&rdquo; we often think of physical abuse or neglect, which is a medical way of thinking.</p><p> As a financial professional you may think of &ldquo;elder abuse&rdquo; as financial abuse or wrongdoing.</p><p> Put yourself in your client&rsquo;s place.</p><h3> Here are three crucial questions they need to ask you as a financial professional: <br/>  </h3><li> What information do I need to age in place?</li><li> What if I have special circumstances that I want to be considered in my estate planning?</li><li> What do I need to include in my planning if I become incapacitated while working with you? <br/>  </li><h3> These are the 12 key areas of practice for Elder Law: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Health and Personal Care Planning </strong> , including giving advice regarding, and preparing, advance medical directives (medical powers of attorney, living wills, and health care declarations) and counseling older persons, individuals with supplemental/special needs, attorneys-in-fact, and families about life care, medical and life-sustaining choices, and related personal life choices.</p><p> <strong>  2. Pre-Mortem Legal Planning </strong> , including giving advice and preparing documents regarding wills, trusts, durable general or financial powers of attorney, real estate, gifting, and the financial and income, estate and gift tax implications of any proposed action.</p><p> <strong>  3. Fiduciary Representation </strong> , including seeking the appointment of, giving advice to, representing, or serving as executor, personal representative, attorney-in-fact, trustee, guardian, conservator, representative payee, or other formal or informal fiduciary.</p><p> <strong>  4. Legal Capacity Counseling </strong> , including advising how capacity is determined and the level of capacity required for various legal activities, and representing those who are or may be the subject of guardianship/conservatorship proceedings or other protective arrangements.</p><p> <strong>  5. Public Benefits Advice </strong> , including planning for and assisting in obtaining Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Veterans benefits and housing and food programs.</p><p> <strong>  6. Special Needs Counseling </strong> , including the planning, drafting and administration of special/supplemental needs trusts, housing, employment, education and related issues.</p><p> <strong>  7. Advice on Insurance Matters </strong> , including analyzing and explaining the types of insurance available, such as health, life, long term care, home care, COBRA, medigap, long term disability, dread disease, prescription coverage, and burial/funeral policies.</p><p> <strong>  8. Resident Rights Advocacy </strong> , including advising patients and residents of hospitals, nursing facilities, continuing care retirement communities, assisted living facilities, adult care facilities, and those cared for in their homes of their rights and appropriate remedies in matters such as admission, transfer and discharge policies, quality of care, and related issues.</p><p> <strong>  9. Housing Counseling </strong> , including reviewing the alternatives available and their financing such as: renovation loan programs, life care contracts, home equity conversion, reverse and other mortgage options.</p><p> <strong>  10. Employment and Retirement Advice </strong> , including pensions, retiree health benefits, unemployment benefits, and other benefits.</p><p> <strong>  11. Counseling with regard to age and/or disability discrimination in employment </strong> , housing and related areas.</p><p> <strong>  12. Litigation and Administrative Advocacy in connection with any of the above matters </strong> , including will contests, contested capacity issues, elder abuse (including financial or consumer fraud), fiduciary administration, public benefits, nursing home torts, and discrimination.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> Becoming aware of planning issues in each of these 12 areas of practice empowers you so that you better identify impacts of your planning in this demanding multi-disciplinary area.</p><p> This list makes it clear for you that elder law planning goes far beyond Medicaid planning to housing options, guardianship, property and health care management, abuse and financial exploitation of the elderly, as well estate planning and retirement planning.</p><p> Good practice management of each of the above items will help you avoid a failure of incapacity planning for your client which will help them avoid abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation as they age.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> A batch of mixed economic data was released the past two weeks that underlines continued strength among U.S. businesses and manufacturers. <br/>  </h3><p> But consumer confidence still seems to be held back by the global slowdown, central bank policy concerns and other factors. This suggests investors should remain cautious and might want to consider assets that have demonstrated an ability to preserve capital in times of uncertainty&mdash;gold and short-term municipal bonds among them.</p><p> For the third straight month, consumer confidence slipped on fears that the days of cheap gasoline might be coming to an end. The University of Michigan&rsquo;s Index of Consumer Sentiment fell to 90 in March, down from 91.7 in February. Although it&rsquo;s still above recession levels, the index has been trending down for the past 12 months.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-index-03-2016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-index-03-2016.png\"/> </a> <br/> Conditions improved for manufacturers in New York State, according to the monthly Empire State Manufacturing Survey.</p><p> Many investors pay attention to this metric as an indicator of industry health in the very influential New York region of the U.S.</p><p> The headline reading climbed 17 points to its first positive score since July of last year, with significant improvements in new orders and shipments. Manufacturers also said they were more optimistic about business conditions six months out.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/manufacturing-new-york-improves-for-the-first-time-since-july-2015-03222016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Manufacturing in New York Improves for the First time since July 2015\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/frank-talk-images/2016_ft/Jan-Jun/manufacturing-new-york-improves-for-the-first-time-since-july-2015-03222016.png\"/> </a> <br/>  </p><p> But overall industrial production told a slightly different story. Activity  fell 0.5 percent  in February month-over-month, and as I explained earlier in the week, industrial production is a subset of GDP, which indicates where the markets have been.</p><p> Housing data was also mixed. On the one hand, we saw a higher-than-expected rate of new housing starts in February. Single-family homes led the way, rising from 767,000 in January to 822,000, the highest print since the end of the recession. This helped push the total number of homes to 1.18 million, a 5.2 percent increase from January and an impressive 30.9 percent jump from the previous February.</p><p> At the same time, existing-home sales dropped a substantial 7.1 percent in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. Low supply levels and price growth were the leading culprits.</p><p> The most welcome news was that the core consumer price index (CPI)&mdash;which excludes food and energy&mdash;rose 2.3 percent year-over-year in February, representing the fourth straight month of inflation and the highest rate since October 2008.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-18/COMM-good-for-gold-core-inflation-heats-up-03182016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\" Core Inflamation Heats Up\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-18/COMM-good-for-gold-core-inflation-heats-up-03182016.png\"/> </a> <br/> As I&rsquo;ve pointed out many times before, gold has tended to respond well when inflationary pressure pushes real interest rates below zero.</p><p> To get the real rate, you subtract the headline CPI from the U.S. Treasury yield. When it&rsquo;s negative, as it is now, gold becomes more attractive to investors seeking preservation of their capital. The yellow metal has risen more than 17 percent so far this year, making it one of the best performers in 2016.</p><h3> Muni Bonds Could Be Poised for Another Strong Year <br/>  </h3><p> Uncertainty over the direction the Federal Reserve might take on interest rates is also influencing investors to add to their short-term municipal bond exposure.</p><p> Munis were the top-performing fixed-income asset of 2015, and they appear poised for another strong year. The Fed revealed last week that it expects to raise rates twice this year, possibly as soon as April, which makes short-term munis more attractive since they&rsquo;re less sensitive to rate adjustments than longer-term debt. And because they&rsquo;re tax-free at the federal level, they appeal to wealthy investors who seek to protect their capital against possibly-rising income taxes, depending on which presidential candidate wins the election in November.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> One of the first things I learned as an FBI Agent was that to be successful, I would need to think like a winner.</p><p> When pulling a gun to make an arrest, there is no room for error&mdash;not only did I need to be right, I needed to come out on the winning side.</p><p> My state of mind directly impacted my performance. I needed to be mindful, in the present moment, and in complete control of what was surging through my thoughts even if I was nervous, stressed and under pressure.</p><p> Thinking like a winner is not rocket science; it sounds easy, but many entrepreneurs and business owners fail to do this because they are not consciously aware of their thoughts.</p><p> Without awareness of what we are thinking, we cannot control where the mind goes&mdash;and as we all know, the mind can sometimes have a life of its own.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are five ways to train your mind to think like a winner: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Run The Show To Think Like A Winner <br/>  </h3><p> Run the show by controlling your thoughts, rather than letting your thoughts control you.</p><p> To do this, you will need to become more connected to them throughout your day. Controlling our thought process isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds because we don&rsquo;t notice how little control we have over the way our mind thinks. One thought follows another, and out of habit, we let our subconscious take us through most of the day.</p><p> We have arrived at where we are today because our thoughts have brought us here, but where we end up tomorrow depends a great deal on where our thoughts take us.</p><p> Meditation is an excellent way move out of your subconscious and be an observer of your own thoughts, even the ones that frighten you.</p><p> WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:</p><p> As an investigator, I learned to continually question my assumptions about almost everything! But by doing so, I trained my mind to be alert about everything going on around me.</p><p> Move out of your subconscious by intentionally choosing to observe, question, challenge, or dismiss new pieces of information that come your way.</p><h3> 2. Stimulate Your Mind To Think Like A Winner <br/>  </h3><p> Introducing humor and playing with ideas are both extremely stimulating. If we train our brain to seek out new information, we no longer need to rely upon our external circumstances to provide mental stimulation.</p><p> This can be extremely important when we&rsquo;re in a situation where we feel trapped or immobilized.</p><p> WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:</p><p> My fellow FBI agents frequently used humor to defray tense and stressful situations. Humor helps our mind change the way it views our stressors.  <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-humor-code/201109/the-importance-humor-research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Laughter is a physical response that relaxes us </a> .</p><p> By training your mind to be playful, it will make it easier to take in new information from outside your current situation and then use this new information to help you think through problems.</p><h3> 3. Visualize Your Success To Think Like A Winner <br/>  </h3><p> The benefits of visioning our performance is based on solid science. The very act of giving our brain a detailed portrait of our end goal ensures the release of dopamine, a powerful mental toughness tool to steer us toward success.</p><p> Dopamine is the chemical that becomes active when we encounter situations that are linked to rewards from the past. It enables us to not only see rewards, but to move toward those rewards.</p><p> A Harvard study has demonstrated that our brain cannot tell the difference between a visualized image and reality.</p><p> WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:</p><p> Defensive tactics was an exercise in visualization because we were taught how to anticipate the movements of a person avoiding arrest. By visualizing what could go wrong, we prepared ourselves to be successful.</p><p> You can do the same thing: if you have a speaking engagement or a meeting, visualize what you will say and how you will say it.</p><h3> 4. Tap Into Your Inner Self To Think Like A Winner <br/>  </h3><p> Vicktor Frankl, a Holocaust and concentration camp survivor, described the source of his strength under extreme adversity. Frankl concludes that the most important trait of survivors is a strong sense of doing their best in all circumstances, while not being primarily concerned with advancing their own interests.</p><p> The actions of the survivors are motivated by an inner voice that taps into their sense of purpose&mdash;not by their external conditions. They had the mental toughness to keep moving ahead, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p> WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:</p><p> While the FBI is not a touchy-feely group of people, they are able to tap into their purpose and passion&mdash;it&rsquo;s what motivates them to chase terrorists and other criminals.</p><p> If your only goal is to make money and buy more stuff, you are thinking liking a loser, not a winner. You are one of the narcissistic people who fall apart when external conditions turn threatening because you are only intrinsically motivated to help yourself. </p><h3> 5. Get Specific Sooner To Think Like A Winner <br/>  </h3><p> Getting specific requires us to:</p><li> Prioritize and make choices.</li><li> Identify our unique message</li><li> Become a master of a few things instead of a &ldquo;know it all.&rdquo;</li><li> Be humble about the things in which we are not an expert</li><li> Foster gratitude for the things in which we do excel <br/>  </li><p> WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:</p><p> The shotgun approach works only if you are not sure of your options, but a laser focused approach is what will yield the best results once a decision is made.</p><p> Smart people specify, prioritize, and focus on specific opportunities that they know will most likely lead to their success. These 5 steps outlined above are embedded in common sense and validated by top notch research and science. Discovering how to make them work for you is your own secret to success.</p><p> Training your mind to think like a winner is not always easy, and like anything else, it takes practice.</p><p> How have your trained yourself to think like a winner?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Whether yours is a small, midsize or large IT services firm, and whether you sell products, provide services or a combination of both, you&rsquo;ve undoubtedly felt some seismic shifts in the past few years as competitors and collaborators rapidly buy, sell and merge. <br/>  </h3><p> Why is this happening now?</p><p> For one, IT services are maturing and becoming commoditized. Continued growth requires management acumen and capital, and often, having one is dependent on the other. Maturation also brings opportunities to apply economies of scale to the business.  </p><p> As a result, strategic buyers within the industry, as well as institutional investors, have applied their knowledge to IT services, resulting in a rapid scaling of the sector.</p><p> In addition, we see two market paradigms converging. Legacy VARs and systems integrators have historically led their sales and business development with products from partners, such as Cisco, or Dell, and today most still derive 60 percent to 70 percent or more of revenues from product sales.</p><p> However, these firms are having a hard time transforming themselves into managed services providers because of the very different business model and company culture required.</p><p> At the other end of the spectrum are thousands of companies with strong service cultures generating revenues of $5 million or less from services and recurring work. These companies typically lack sales expertise and manufacturer relationships; as a result, they tend not to participate on the front end of major new technology rollouts (products and services) at potential or existing clients.</p><p> These VARs and MSPs have natural chemistry.</p><p> Meanwhile, new players have entered the IT space in recent years, attracted by a growing market with higher margins than their original businesses.  Think distributors, such as Insight and Arrow; printer and camera manufacturers, like Ricoh, Konika and Xerox; and even electronics manufacturers moving into technology.  And, with the latest cloud-related developments, IT services firms that have played at the application layer are becoming interested in infrastructure managed services firms, where they can apply their more mature organizational structures.</p><p> An additional consolidation driver will be MSPs and systems integrators adding application-layer capabilities. This is especially true for companies focused on vertical markets, such as financial services, K-12, health care or government, where firms are vertically integrating with the goal of offering complete solutions from infrastructure to applications &mdash; and where the cloud is the linking factor.</p><p> In addition, in previous cycles, companies largely grew organically or via acquisitions based, to a large extent, on geography. Most firms started locally and used acquisitions to logically build out territories. Recently, however, we see buyers focusing more on skill sets, cultural fit and synergies, resulting in multiple acquisitions, even of smaller companies, that are geographically separated from the buyer.</p><p> Succeeding in this fast-moving environment requires that firms understand the M&amp;A market, its dynamics and the opportunities. But make no mistake: Consolidation will continue, whether entrepreneurs understand their long-term options or not.</p>",

    "link": "workplace-stress-the-top-five-causes-and-how-your-boss-can-help",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> We've all heard office horror stories. <br/>  </h3><p> Whether they involve long, grueling hours, gossipy deskmates, or even tyrannical bosses who alphabetize their pen collections, it almost seems natural at this point for the workplace to be a stressful environment.</p><p> In fact, a poll conducted by Harris Interactive found that an alarming 80% of employees were stressed at their jobs.</p><p> <strong>  The top five reasons were: </strong></p><li> Low pay (13%)</li><li> Long commutes (13%)</li><li> Unreasonable workload (12%)</li><li> Annoying coworkers (10%)</li><li> Poor work-life balance (8%) <br/>  </li><p> Gallup&rsquo;s research indicates that well-being is closely tied to employee engagement. So too much stress can make workers disengaged &mdash; and possibly send them running for the hills. Neither outcome is beneficial for managers looking to run an effective team, so what can be done?</p><h3> Leaders to the Rescue <br/>  </h3><p> Luckily, there&rsquo;s a solution right in front of us. A recent Virgin Pulse survey found the following about employees:</p><li> 44% say their relationship with their employers lowers their stress levels</li><li> 60% say their relationship with their employers helps them focus and stay more productive <br/>  </li><p> These findings show that supportive leadership can have a lot of sway when it comes to building a healthy workplace for their workers.</p><h3> <strong>  Let's look at ways to address the top five issues mentioned in the Harris Interactive poll. </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Low Pay <br/>  </h3><p> Salary can be a tricky subject, and of course what an employee considers &ldquo;low&rdquo; can be different from the employer&rsquo;s perspective. But keep in mind that underpaying employees will be more expensive in the long run due to the costs of turnover.</p><p> Consider the context too: a solid benefits package or stock options can make a moderate salary much more attractive. Also, employees can feel more anxious about pay if they&rsquo;re uncertain about how to earn raises and bonuses (or are uncertain they&rsquo;re available at all). A little communication can go a long way here. Misinformation or lack of clarity can result in unnecessary stress.</p><h3> 2. Long Commutes <br/>  </h3><p> You can&rsquo;t control where your employees live, of course, but you can help ease the burden of commuting. If possible, give your workers the option of a work-from-home day once a week or more, depending on what&rsquo;s feasible. Showing this type of flexibility in your approach to management demonstrates that you trust your employees &mdash; plus it gives them the added bonus of taking it a relaxing start to the day.</p><p> And make sure your commuters have what they need. Consider subsidizing parking or bus passes. See if you can get a group discount for nearby parking lots. Make sure there&rsquo;s space for bicyclists to safely store their bikes. If you&rsquo;re far away from the nearest public transit option, see if you can set up a shuttle system to get employees to and from the station.</p><h3> 3. Unreasonable Workload <br/>  </h3><p> All businesses see an ebb and flow in workload, and you can&rsquo;t avoid increasing the demand on your employees. But see how you can make the load easier even if you can&rsquo;t lighten it: Analyze how work is divvied up and make sure it&rsquo;s distributed as evenly as possible. Check with employees to see if there are ways to make processes more efficient, or if there are tools that can help them do their work more easily. You&rsquo;ll go a long way towards fostering a team mentality of \"we can do this!\" rather than \"I quit.\"</p><p> If overloading persists, it might be time to expand the team. Hiring more personnel takes up more resources, but it can make the difference in whether or not your employees can produce quality work that they&rsquo;re proud of and that contributes to your company performance.</p><p> Also, make sure to work on maintaining your own engagement &mdash; an anxious manager will make employees feel more overwhelmed.</p><h3> 4. Annoying Coworkers <br/>  </h3><p> If you know people don't get along, look for solutions. That may involve a sit-down discussion between the two, but in some cases, simply making sure those people don't sit next to each other can go a long way. If issues persist, rearranging teams might be in order.</p><p> For a long-term solution, evaluate job candidates to make sure they&rsquo;ll fit with the team and culture. It&rsquo;s much easier to weed out someone who isn&rsquo;t a culture fit during the recruitment process.</p><h3> 5. Poor Work-Life Balance <br/>  </h3><p> In an ideal world, no one would be overburdened with responsibilities. However, budgets for staffing aren't limitless, and sometimes work-life imbalance can seem unavoidable. If that's the case, make sure to be as reasonable as possible with accommodations. Let your employees know you have their best interests at heart. Support them in using PTO for family issues and other personal matters as needed, so they don&rsquo;t waste time and energy worrying about these things while they&rsquo;re at work. Remember that giving someone an extra day or even half-day off is a great way to reward hardworking employees.</p><p> On a day-to-day basis, use telecommuting or flexible scheduling to make it easier for employees to fit work into their lives. This might mean an investment in technology to support remote workers, but it will pay off. According to a survey by ConnectSolutions, 77% of remote workers report greater productivity when working off site.</p><h3> Evaluating Progress <br/>  </h3><p> Talk to your team. Take notice of people who've been on edge, and take note of complaints if they're brought to you. Provide avenues for feedback, both in person and anonymous, so you can stay in touch with how your employees are doing.</p><p> In many cases, the simple act of trying to find a solution can be as beneficial to morale as actually finding one. Many times your team just wants to see that you're invested in their well-being.</p><p> Keeping employees engaged is a delicate balance of finding them the right kinds of work, the right amounts of work, and ensuring they feel taken care of as contributors to your business. While it may not be possible to fix all issues for all employees, by addressing problems that are common amongst them, you'll be lowering stress levels all around, keeping your workforce engaged and helping ensure they find success.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Last week I witnessed something that I consider to be incredibly unusual. <br/>  </h3>In a world where it is more uncommon than not for consumers to have their expectations exceeded, I was actually bowled over by what I experienced. &lsquo;Bowling over&rsquo; a career Customer Experience &lsquo;nut&rsquo; is not that easy to do! What makes the experience all the more amazing, is that what actually happened is not really anything that remarkable!! So how can anyone be &lsquo;wowed&rsquo; by the &lsquo;unremarkable&rsquo;? Let me explain&hellip;. <p> <br/> Very early on Friday morning I boarded a British Airways flight from Paris Orly airport to London Heathrow. Everything was going to plan and we were scheduled to arrive five minutes early. It was only on our descent into London that the pilot advised that there was a minor problem &ndash; thick fog.</p><p> Fog is a weather condition not particularly conducive to seamless air travel &ndash; the pilot had to ask all passengers to turn off their electronic devices due to an order from air traffic control in London. Whilst a little bumpy, we landed without issue and on time.</p><p> I was then due to take a connecting flight from Heathrow to Manchester at 10:20. The gate was announced as normal &ndash; all passengers arrived at the gate to board at the allotted time of 09:50. Still with me???? At 10:20, as the throng of passengers were still seated at the gate, it became clear that we were not going to be leaving on time. The ground staff had not said anything at this stage. At 10:30, they announced that the flight would be leaving at 10:50 &ndash; the only explanation given was the pretty standard &lsquo;late arrival of the aircraft&rsquo;.</p><p> At  approximately 10:45, we started boarding. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits, despite the delay &ndash; we just assumed that the fog was the culprit and there is not a lot any airline can do about that! Once the boarding was complete, we sat and waited for the aircraft to leave.</p><p> Five minutes or so later, the pilot started to make an announcement. Nothing unusual about that. However, as I looked up, I saw that he was not making the announcement from the security and safety of the cockpit, he was standing bang in the middle of the cabin at the front of the aircraft. The captain proceeded, in an incredibly human way, to advise his passengers of exactly what was going on. The flight had indeed been delayed by fog &ndash; but in addition, one of the tyres had a slight tear in it, so had to be replaced.</p><p> Continuing his communication, the pilot advised that boarding had to start late, as a tyre cannot be replaced with passengers on the plane &ndash; &lsquo;you would not change a tyre on a car with passengers in the vehicle either&rsquo;, he told us. </p><p> Apologising for the delay and inconvenience (sincerely), he gave us an idea of how long we would have to wait for the flight to leave and completed the usual announcements he would have normally made from the cockpit.</p><p> Now I fly a lot &ndash; as regular readers of my blog are fully aware. This is one of the most emotionally engaging acts I have experienced in all my years of flying. This man did not follow a rule book. This British Airways employee did not sit on his seat and hide behind a door delivering a robotic insincere message. This wonderful ambassador for British Airways treated his customers as real people &ndash; almost certainly showing them the courtesy that he would like someone to show him.</p><p> I could hear murmurings of approval from all the passengers around me. When I told the cabin manager how impressed I was (I was keen that he told the captain what a great thing he did), the cabin manager told me how lovely it is when a captain is brave enough to do that kind of thing!</p><p> So that is what &lsquo;wowed&rsquo; me &ndash; something as unremarkable as a pilot getting off his bum and addressing his customers in person, had a dramatic effect on improving what could have been seen as a negative experience.</p><p> In fact, I would argue that his actions, made the experience memorable for the right reasons &ndash; I completely forgave British Airways for any inconvenience the delay caused me &ndash; I might not have done if this captain had not done what he did.</p><p> <br/> This is a great example of someone doing what they normally do differently.</p><p> Too often, humans do things that they are comfortable with. When it comes to interacting with customers, this regularly translates into as little personal interaction as possible!</p><p> I regularly meet with senior leaders who are almost scared to meet and talk to customers. The thing is, when you do things the way they have always been done &ndash; the things that are in your &lsquo;comfort zone&rsquo;, it is very unlikely that you are going to &lsquo;wow&rsquo; anyone. Even if you meet a customers expectation, to go that step further and &lsquo;wow&rsquo; the customer, you need to sometimes step out of the comfort zone.</p><p> What this British Airways pilot did was just that &ndash; he delivered a little bit of magic.</p><p> Although I cannot remember his name, this man is a credit to his profession and his company. British Airways now need to encourage similar behaviour from all of their staff &ndash; if they want to consistently improve the Customer Experience and exceed customer expectation, let others learn from this example and get more pilots bums off seats (when appropriate of course!!!)!</p>",

    "content": "<h3> When we find ourselves slipping into survival mode, it can feel pretty chaotic. <br/>  </h3><p> Consider what happens when you&rsquo;ve gone too long without eating, haven&rsquo;t had a good night sleep in a while, or haven&rsquo;t seen the sun in days &ndash; you might not feel quite like yourself.</p><p> This is when I like to remind myself that my &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo; has taken over.</p><p> The first reason it&rsquo;s helpful for me personally, is I happen to be a huge monkey fan, so I instantly get big smile on my face.</p><p> Monkeys always seem to be in a pretty good mood, and are usually playing around, acting silly. So the initial reaction to thinking about something called our &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo; just makes me laugh (and we&rsquo;ll talk about how important laughter is to staying healthy in an upcoming chapter). But there is another reason to consider how the monkey brain responds differently than other parts of our brain, and when it can be detrimental to us.</p><p> Our brain can be separated into three sections &ndash; our lizard brain, our monkey brain, and our human brain. </p><p> The &ldquo;lizard brain&rdquo; is found at the base of the brain, and contains the cerebellum and brain stem. Lizards only have these elements of the brain, which controls our most basic instincts. The next part of the brain, the &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo; includes the majority of our tissue, and controls more complex tasks as well as emotions. Most mammals lead with their &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo;, which is fueled by our most basic responses to fear and desire.</p><p> The most advanced part of the brain is the &ldquo;human brain&rdquo;, which consists of the outer layer, surrounding the &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo;. This area allows for logical, emotionless thought, as well as delayed gratification. It is by using our &ldquo;human brain&rdquo; that we are able to think through our responses, rather than just reacting. But, when we are faced with threats to our system, we don&rsquo;t have time to stop and analyze what&rsquo;s going on. During these times we are glad to have our &ldquo;lizard&rdquo; and &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; brains to get us to safety, through our fight or flight response.</p><p> Because we have so many things going on at one time, when we multitask we can easily find ourselves using our &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo;, making mindless decisions that may end up causing serious problems with important tasks, or even worse, with important relationships.  Next time you find yourself trying to do a million things at once and getting irritable or grumpy with someone you care about, remind yourself that you&rsquo;re using your &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo;, and work on acting more like a human. (Although I&rsquo;d caution against calling anyone else a monkey when they&rsquo;re acting up, it might be a good code word for times when you feel like the other person isn&rsquo;t giving you their full attention.)</p><h3> Quick tips to tame your monkey mind: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Eliminate the noise. </strong>  Turn away from your computer, turn off your phone (airplane mode works on the ground), and create an environment that is calming.</p><p> <strong>  2. Breathe.  </strong> Bring awareness to your breath often throughout the day, and make sure that you're getting what you need. A short, shallow breath rate triggers the stress response which results in \"amygdala hijack\" - monkey madness. Studies show a breathing pace of 6 breaths per minute (in to a count of 5, and out to a count of 5) is ideal for brainpower. </p><p> <strong>  3. Get out of the cage.  </strong> Aim for physical activity at least every 90 minutes in order to keep circulation flowing and cortisol levels in balance. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  The sun always sets - even if the beautiful view is obstructed, it sets.   </strong></h3><p> <br/> How can you delay a sun-setting on your best business relationships? How can you attempt to create a beautiful, unobstructed view as often as possible?  I encourage you to analyze your client relationships, specifically the most challenging ones that drain you.  It is those relationships-the ones where connection is missing or showing signs of strain―that you need to focus on repairing before you lose the client's confidence and ultimately their business.</p><p> However, before you spend time trying to repair the relationship, you need to give serious consideration to the following questions:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Why did you lose that connection? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Until you fully understand the reasons why the relationship is struggling, any attempt to repair it may be futile or potentially more damaging.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Ask yourself, \"What could I have done differently?\" </strong></h3><p> <br/> By humbling ourselves and understanding the active role we must play in each relationship, the better chance we have of not repeating our mistakes.  Plus, this exercise also reminds us of the ageless concept about the customer always being right. An great, active relationship is two-sided.</p><p> Recently, my wife and I have moved two long-term business relationships, as time consuming as that sometimes is, simply because we felt they did not care, or know, that the relationship lacked something. For them, we were not a challenging relationship until, I suppose, we started to ask more questions. That's when their true bed-side manner began to show. We felt that, over time, they did not ask the right questions, listen to our questions and concerns and have genuine empathy for us. After the relationship transitioned, we seem to get their attention - a bit too late for them, however.</p>",

In this day and age, the truth is that whether we like it or not, they are both reflective of one another. And in a crisis, especially a crisis that questions the ethics of either the personal or the professional brand, this reality gets amplified.</p><p> Whole Foods Market is currently in the process of learning this lesson.</p><h3> The CEO, the brand and the alleged sex offender</h3><p> <br/> In December 2015, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/26/us/marc-gafni-center-for-integral-wisdom.html?_r=1%E2%80%9D%20target=\" target=\"_blank\">   New York Times reported  </a> </u>  that one of the founders of the spiritual think tank, the Center for Integral Wisdom, Marc Gafni, is an alleged sex offender. That same article reported that Whole Foods Market&rsquo;s co-CEO, John Mackey, is a chairman on the executive board of the Center, and a strong admirer of Gafni.</p><p> The realization of Mackey&rsquo;s close relationship with Gafni immediately sparked an onslaught of criticism towards Whole Foods. The criticism went as far as compelling over 100 esteemed rabbis to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/whole-foods-www-esalen-com-stop-marc-gafni-from-abusing-again\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   publish an online petition  </a> </u> , addressed directly to Whole Foods, pleading that they sever their ties with Gafni and his organization.</p><p> &ldquo;For decades now, Gafni has behaved in ways that violate every ethical and legal standard known to us; his misdeeds go far beyond what was reported in the New York Times,&rdquo; reads the petition. &ldquo;Recognizing we are part of one humanity who must protect one another, we share this statement in order to prevent future harm to those who may be exposed to him, and as a protest against any individuals, organizations, or institutions that support or endorse him as a teacher or leader. Complicity in giving Gafni a platform is a violation of our tradition&rsquo;s highest ethical and moral standards: &ldquo;Justice, Justice shall you pursue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor.&rdquo;</p><h3> An organization&rsquo;s worst nightmare <br/>  </h3><p> Learning that your organization is associated with &ndash; to the extent of having leveraged the brand&rsquo;s well established, international platform to endorse and support &ndash; an alleged sex offender, is every organization&rsquo;s worst nightmare. But unfortunately, these things can happen, and it&rsquo;s not always a black and white situation &ndash; which can make it even more challenging to manage. However, in this particular case, the situation seems to be more black than it is white.</p><p> When a woman came forth stating that Gafni had sexually assaulted her over an extended period of nine months when she was just 13 years old, Gafni tried to excuse his actions by publicly stating that &ldquo;She was 14 going on 35, and I never forced her.&rdquo;</p><p> So with a disgraceful statement directly from the alleged offender, and with news articles affiliating the Whole Foods name with this scandal, along with a petition pleading with the organization to sever their ties with Gafni, what was Whole Foods to do? What would you do if your organization was found in this troubling position?</p><h3> Whole Foods Market&rsquo;s response to the controversy</h3><p> <br/> Four days after the New York Times article was published, Mackey removed a series of videos that had been published to his Whole Foods blog and replaced them with the following message:</p><p> &ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Note: Post updated on Dec. 29, 2015. From Co-CEO John Mackey:</p><p> My involvement with Marc Gafni and the Center for Integral Wisdom is conducted strictly in my personal life and does not represent an endorsement or support for either Mr. Gafni or the Center for Integral Wisdom by Whole Foods Market. With that said, I have decided to remove the video interviews I participated in with Mr Gafni, and am doing so to be consistent with the position that this is indeed strictly a personal relationship. All of them can still be found on the Center for Integral Wisdom site.&rdquo; (A link to the Center&rsquo;s website was included in this statement)</p><h3> What&rsquo;s wrong with this crisis management approach?</h3><p> <br/> For starters, the statement was completely devoid of compassion or any sense of regret at the affiliation or, at the very least, the situation at-hand.</p><p> Secondly, the fact that Mackey himself published this statement, rather than it having been published by the organization, didn&rsquo;t help Whole Foods disassociate itself from the controversy at all. Had the organization published the statement, it would have had a better chance at being effective. But instead, let&rsquo;s examine what this statement looks like, coming from Mackey:</p><p> Mackey used the Whole Foods website to publish a statement on behalf of himself, stating that his relationship with Gafni does not reflect upon the Whole Foods brand. Do you see the disconnect? The three are entirely linked together within this statement, which completely contradicts the statement itself. This message would have been much more compelling and believable had the statement been made by the brand, rather than by Mackey. It also would have had more of a chance at satisfying the public&rsquo;s expectation that Whole Foods should release a statement. Instead, the brand is still under scrutiny for not having done so yet.</p><p> And while there is such thing as having personal relationships that do not overlap or reflect on the organization for which you work, there are two factors that play into this not being the case for Whole Foods in this particular situation:</p><li> Mackey is a co-founder of Whole Foods, not just an employee. Therefore, his personal moral and ethical choices are, at least in part, a reflection on his organization; and</li><li> When you openly choose to have a relationship with an alleged sex offender who has willingly admitted to having had sexual relations with a young girl, your character will be judged. And like it or not, as co-CEO, that judgment inevitably reflects upon the organization you represent. <br/>  </li><p> But, in my opinion, the statement&rsquo;s biggest failure was the inclusion of the link to Gafni&rsquo;s organization&rsquo;s website where the videos can still be found. Providing a link-back to another website is a sign of endorsement &ndash; and a powerful one at that, to both the website&rsquo;s viewers (i.e.: Whole Foods&rsquo;s stakeholders) and to Google. Whether Whole Foods realizes it or not, this link-back is a show of endorsement and support. It also gives the message that, if Mackey didn&rsquo;t need to remove the videos, he wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p><p> While, to my understanding, Whole Foods has reactively sent a version of this message to some of its stakeholders in response to inquiries, this is the only proactive statement that has so far been issued since the news broke in December. It&rsquo;s a statement of mixed messages, with actions that speak far louder than the words it contains.</p><h3> Recommended next steps for Whole Foods Market</h3><p> <br/> Either Whole Foods supports Gafni, and thus his organization, or they don&rsquo;t. But they need to come out with a strong statement that defines their position &ndash; and follow that statement up with actions that support it. If they don&rsquo;t support Gafni or his affiliations, then they need to sever all ties &ndash; or at the very least, refrain from any public associations with Gafni and his Center &ndash; and stop sending out contradicting messages. For example, they should remove their name from the listed &ldquo;Premium Sponsors&rdquo; of the Center&rsquo;s Success Summit.</p><p> If they do choose to support Gafni, well, then they should continue to remain silent on the subject, as the consequences of remaining silent at this point would be far less severe than coming out and declaring support.</p><p> A confidential tip revealed that Whole Foods will be releasing a statement by the end of the month. While I&rsquo;m interested to see what their statement will be, it&rsquo;s just as troubling to think that it&rsquo;s taking the organization weeks to address the situation after they&rsquo;ve made the internal decision to do so. That&rsquo;s of course assuming that the confidential tip is in fact accurate. Time will tell.</p><p> As Nancy Levine mentioned in her  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.epictimes.com/nancylevine/2016/03/whole-foods-ceo-link-to-alleged-sex-abuse-rabbi-condemned/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Epic Times article  </a> </u> , this controversy comes at a time when the world is fighting to spread awareness and to change the culture of staying silent or continuing to endorse or maintain relationships with sex offenders. Timing is everything, and although there is never a good time to be associated with a scandal of this sort, it seems that now (and hopefully moving forward, for society&rsquo;s sake) will be even more of a harmful time to find your organization in such a situation.</p><h3> What do you think about this story?</h3><p> <br/> This type of issue is a challenging situation to have to face. What do you think about Whole Foods&rsquo;s actions and choice of response to this issue?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathonhensley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Jonathon Hensley  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.emergeinteractive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Emerge Interactive  </u> </a></p><p> The excitement about big data&rsquo;s potential is palpable these days. It&rsquo;s often referred to as a &ldquo;revolution,&rdquo; and there are loads of articles proclaiming its transformative power. New metaphors keep popping up to help explain what we can learn from it: it&rsquo;s like frozen yogurt, it&rsquo;s like a  <a href=\"https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/what-can-a-paper-shredder-teach-us-about-big-data\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  paper shredder </a> . There are at least a couple dozen TED talks dedicated to it. So, overexposed? Sure. But overhyped? Probably not.</p><h3> <strong>  Big data has already changed the way we live. </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s no denying big data&rsquo;s ability to offer businesses previously out-of-reach insights&mdash;about value chains, about new markets, about trends, and even about the habits of individual customers. It&rsquo;s allowed manufacturers to streamline processes, increase output, and cut costs. It&rsquo;s enabled the healthcare industry to offer new products and services that improve quality of life, and in some cases even help to predict epidemics and hasten cures. And corporations are investing billions: Google&rsquo;s recent purchase of home automation company  <u>  <a href=\"https://nest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nest  </a> </u>  will give them a line of access to new kinds of data, and Facebook&rsquo;s $19 billion acquisition of  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   WhatsApp  </a> </u>  gives them better access to all-important mobile data.</p><p> From Amazon recommending the books you didn&rsquo;t know you wanted to read, to Spotify and Pandora curating playlists for your every mood, data allows companies to close the gap between what customers expect from brands and what those brands are offering. Customers today want individual attention, and companies are responding with an &ldquo;every customer&rsquo;s a VIP&rdquo; treatment made possible by big data. Data allows retailers to improve a customer&rsquo;s entire journey and experience at each touch point based on their behavior. And path analysis can provide an understanding of the routes users take in order to customize their own shopping experiences. In the home,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/digital-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   data is being used to offer new levels of customization and precision  </a> </u>  in everything from thermostats to fridges, and now there are even social robots who can help around the house&mdash;managing your communications, taking family photos, even keeping your children company by reading them stories. More and more, as the notion of a quantified self really takes hold, consumers are managing their own data: from Fitbit and UP, that allow users to track and share performance stats, to FitBark and Whistle, which allow you to keep up on (you guessed it) your pet&rsquo;s data.</p><p> And consider the effect data can have on our infrastructure. A few years ago GE began harnessing data from trains and planes in order to create what they&rsquo;re calling an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ge.com/stories/industrial-internet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Industrial Internet  </a> </u> &mdash;connecting machines in order to increase efficiency and predict malfunctions. Or look at how IBM&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Smarter Cities  </a> </u>  initiative has been using data to identify congestion in order to improve the flow of traffic. Or how data generated from ticketing systems, social media, and sensors on vehicles and traffic signals has allowed the Transport of London to track user journeys in order to improve efficiency, response time, and to get the most updated information to riders. And then there are police departments: many are now using data to identify patterns in order to solve crimes faster. For a specific example, Durham, NC has been able to use predictive analytics to reduce violent crime  <u>  <a href=\"http://smartcitiescouncil.com/article/how-durham-nc-fights-crime-data-%E2%80%93-and-wins\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   by 50%  </a> </u> .</p><p> In short, big data has already shown the ability to improve our commutes, to keep us safer and healthier, to allow us deeper interaction with our appliances, our pets and our robots. And it has the potential to enhance nearly all interactions between a person and a brand.</p><h3> <strong>  The biggest challenge? Trust. </strong></h3><p> <br/> But to do all this, a ton of data is needed, and from a wide array of diverse sources. This goes way beyond, say, transactional history and demographics. And it takes sophisticated analysis to make sense of it all, which can be a significant hurdle&mdash;especially for your average company who doesn&rsquo;t have an in-house analytic infrastructure and a team of data scientists on the payroll. What&rsquo;s more, data is often owned by any number of third parties, and corralling it all and sharing it is a real challenge.</p><p> But the deeper challenges center on trust and ethics. The fact is, companies have always used data and analytics, but the ethical questions have become so much more urgent and complex because of the extent of data we&rsquo;re now dealing with, and because of how much easier technology has made its collection and employment. It&rsquo;s no mystery that data theft is a huge problem (the U.S.&rsquo;s fastest growing crime, in fact), and that large companies are particularly susceptible to security breaches (just ask JP Morgan, whose data breach affected more than 70 million households, or Sony Pictures who had nearly 50,000 Social Security numbers exposed, just to name two  cases in recent history), but it&rsquo;s less clear cut, both legally and ethically, what exactly companies should or must do to protect people as best they can, or how much data is too much, or what&rsquo;s fair game and what&rsquo;s off limits.</p><p> The 2012 Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights does lay down some clear guidelines, and in response a number of companies have pledged to offer consumers a &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; option, but as of now all this is more of a request than a legal obligation. (Other parts of the world&mdash;from the EU to South Africa to South Korea&mdash;have far stricter and more clear protection rules.) The fact is, many average citizens are wary of big data, and it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t trust the entities who so badly want their personal information.  </p><p> The Brooklyn electronic music project Big Data had a breakout track last year called &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; with lyrics that seem to speak to these concerns: ...peeping through the floor, it&rsquo;s like they know&hellip; they&rsquo;re right under my bed, they&rsquo;re on patrol&hellip; Trust in the government and large corporations are at  <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/11/13/public-trust-in-government/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  all-time lows </a> . In fact, only around  <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  5% </a>  of people are &ldquo;very confident&rdquo; that data collected by companies will remain private and secure, and this dips down to 2% for search engines, and 1% for social media sites. Yet people have come more and more to accept personally targeted marketing, or even to actively embrace it (a  <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/reports/delivering-value-in-the-data-exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  2014 report </a>  suggests that ⅔ of consumers want companies to know their history), even if they don&rsquo;t completely understand exactly what kind of data is being collected. According to  <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/05/customer-data-designing-for-transparency-and-trust\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  a recent study </a>  done for the Harvard Business Journal, only about a quarter of people know that their social network friends list and location are being noted, and only 14% realize that their web histories could be fair game. It makes for an odd mixture of complacency and alarm.</p><p> And this isn't the only paradox of the big data revolution. A  <u>  <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2325537\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent article  </a> </u>  in the Stanford Law Review pointed out a few others, including transparency and power. For one thing, companies are collecting all this private information about average consumers, yet the average consumer is either ignorant of, or actively prevented from knowing about, what&rsquo;s being done with their data. In addition, big data promises much empowerment for the individual consumer, yet it tends to further concentrate power in the hands of the largest corporations.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no wonder that so many people are pushing for a whole new ethical framework, and why governments are now actively involved. Innovation is important. Efficiency is important. Offering customers the best, most personal experience is important. But do we need to sacrifice our values along the way?</p><h3> <strong>  The good news: we should be able to have it all. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Although innovation and ethics may sometimes seem in competition when it comes to big data, it's actually possible to collect and analyze data in a way that respects people&rsquo;s privacy and increases their trust, without the data losing any of its power. What&rsquo;s more, this heightened trust should also lead to more opportunities for collaboration and an increase in the pace of innovation.</p><p> Ok. But how do we get there?</p><h3> <strong>  Be transparent </strong></h3><p> <br/> All this opportunity begins with business leaders promoting transparency and fostering trust by getting more explicit permission from consumers, and by being as specific as possible about what&rsquo;s being done with data. This goes well beyond some kind of disclosure or terms and conditions agreement and gets into actual education and informed consent. Open and honest information sharing will increase customer trust and loyalty, and as a result will likely grant companies deeper access to data. On the other hand, the risks of shrouding data practices in secret are real and costly: customer backlash and the kind of distrust that will actively prevent you from collecting the data you want. Facebook has experienced this more than once, and even Zuckerberg  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/04/zuckerberg-f8-interview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   talked  </a> </u>  not long ago about the need for more trust between Facebook and its users, saying, &ldquo;We need to give people more control over their information so that everyone feels comfortable using these products.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Provide direct value </strong></h3><p> <br/> When consumers are given a measure of control and some genuine education they can better understand the value of their data&mdash;the value to companies, yes, but also the value to themselves. This is a key point: the collection of data from consumers should provide them direct value, and since some data is more valuable to companies than others (the deepest and most personal info) consumers should see corresponding value for giving it up. Examples of this direct value can be seen in a consumer&rsquo;s data being used to improve a product they actually use, like Netflix&rsquo;s refined recommendation algorithms, or to offer a service that makes their life more convenient, like Delta launching an app that allows passengers to track their bags. On the other hand, having one&rsquo;s data sold off to a third party usually provides little or no value to a consumer. The more transparent companies are about what&rsquo;s being done with the data they&rsquo;re collecting, and what value they're providing in exchange for it, the more trust they earn. And with trust, consumers will be willing to share much more. In a relationship like this, it becomes mutually beneficial to offer people full access to information, and the ability to manage their data.</p><h3> <strong>  Know when to say when </strong></h3><p> <br/> Currently, most people do not have much data management ability, and it&rsquo;s still fairly easy for certain companies to collect massive amounts of data from people without them ever knowing. But that does not mean this is a wise course. It doesn&rsquo;t mean you should just dig and dig and dig. For one thing, too much data can very easily lead to analysis paralysis. Airlines, who have access to tons of data, have already realized this and are being much more selective about what they target. In addition, there&rsquo;s a real risk in trying to collect data too deeply on individuals, and in too closely targeting them&mdash;a risk that ranges from irking your customers all the way to inadvertently exposing things about them that they want kept private (sexuality, health, political leanings, etc.) Target ran into this quite infamously in 2012 when they used &ldquo;pregnancy prediction&rdquo; scores to target customers and ended up  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/\" target=\"_blank\">   revealing a young woman&rsquo;s pregnancy to her father  </a> </u> . It shouldn&rsquo;t take stories like this to remind us that there are real people behind all this data, and that we need to be more conscious about what kinds of data we collect, and especially about what we do with it. This takes forethought and planning; it takes an investment in responsible analysis and storage; and it takes instituting guidelines that CEOs can champion.</p><p> It also takes empathy and a little common sense. Sure, it might seem like a grand idea to offer people a snapshot from exactly one year ago on social media, or to run a year-in-review slideshow for them. But how often will you be forcing people to relive tragedies? Again, just because data has made something new and exciting possible, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to go there&mdash;not without thinking it through very carefully. It&rsquo;s really easy to get caught up and assume too much intimacy with the user, and before you know it you&rsquo;re stepping over the line from helpful into distressing.</p><h3> <strong>  Leading the way forward. </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s so much to be gained for those willing to lead this revolution by example&mdash;to help evolve the way we collect and handle people&rsquo;s data and, by extension, how we treat those people themselves. Yes, it&rsquo;s still possible for companies to get away with a certain amount of secrecy and carelessness in their data collection and employment. But things are beginning to shift. There are calls for a new ethical framework coming from governments, consumers, and even from many business leaders. The way forward is all about trust. Which is perfect, because there&rsquo;s nothing more important to a brand.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> <strong>  Who Do You Want As Your Customer? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Recently I was working with a client and we were discussing different types of customers &ndash; specifically loyal customers &ndash; that any business might encounter. I thought it would be interesting to share the list that we came up with. I&rsquo;ve identified six main types of customers that just about all types of businesses could have &ndash; or have already. I included businesses that have loyalty programs because so many of my clients do.</p><h3> <strong>  Customers Who Are Satisfied:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> A satisfied customer is not a loyal customer. They may appear to be loyal, but they aren&rsquo;t. I refer to these types of customers as &ldquo;dangerous customers.&rdquo; You think they are happy because they are satisfied. While they don&rsquo;t dislike you, they don&rsquo;t love you either. These customers may like (not love) your products and services, even without incentives stay with you. They don&rsquo;t complain. And, they don&rsquo;t leave &ndash; until your competitor offers a better experience or something that appears to be of greater value.</p><h3> <strong>  Customers Who Are Loyal to Your Loyalty Program:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Not unlike the satisfied customer, these customers are not really loyal either. These customers are loyal to your loyalty program, but not to your products or services. They appear to be loyal because they come back again and again, but not because they like you. They come back because they love accumulating points or having their card punched. The airlines come to mind. Some customers may stay with an airline just because of the points they&rsquo;ve accumulated that can be put toward free tickets. Sometimes the perks are even more important than the price.</p><h3> <strong>  Customers Who Enjoy Convenience:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are customers who shop with you simply because you are convenient. It may be because of your location, or that they don&rsquo;t know about the competition. They may or may not be price sensitive. These customers are ripe to be converted to loyal customers, if you can give them a reason to do so.</p><h3> <strong>  Customers Who Appear to Be Loyal, but Don&rsquo;t Really Like You: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Not all customers like you, but they still continue to do business with you. Maybe it&rsquo;s easier to stay with you, rather than switch. For example, a customer may not like the bank they go to. But they choose to stay there because it would be a hassle to go to another bank and fill out paperwork, transfer the money and more. Given the chance for an easy exit, they may take it.</p><h3> <strong>  Customers Who Are Loyal to Your Low Prices:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you choose to compete in the low price arena, you will find shoppers who are more loyal to the price than your company. As soon as they find a lower price elsewhere, they leave you. If you advertise that you are the lowest price, you better be the lowest price.</p><h3> <strong>  Customers Who Are Really Loyal:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> This is the customer who loves your products and services. They would never dream of doing business with anyone else. Price isn&rsquo;t an issue. And, you don&rsquo;t need a loyalty program to keep this customer loyal. Most likely, they enjoy the relationship they have with your company and/or the people who work in your company. This is the ultimate loyal customer. This is who you want to be doing business with.</p><p> This is the list I came up with. Are there any other types of loyal customers that you can think of?</p>",

It takes effort and time to find the potential good connections, and even longer to create a solid relationship. <br/>  </h3><p> Ultimately, the better connections will provide the best introductions on your behalf.</p><p> Yesterday&rsquo;s blog was about embracing other perspectives and to adapt to your own style. How you connect is another area of accepting a wider variety of perspectives</p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> Today, I exchanged tweet messages with a mutual follower. Almost 14 years ago, a business acquaintance and I met. Today she interviewed me and made a valuable introduction. I reciprocated by making a similar type of introduction for her. On a high note, being found on social media, I was asked by New Voice Media to write an article. Promotion of the article was promised among the company&rsquo;s media channels.</p><p> I make it a habit to try out and implement a variety of ways to accomplish the same in order to know which works best. It&rsquo;s part of the trial and error approach to business. In the end, it is easy to conclude the right answer for me. It&rsquo;s important to note that the answers for each of us may vary dramatically.</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Are you solely relying on one networking group to meet folks or do you cast a wide net? Time efficiency is essential and that&rsquo;s why the social media platforms prove to be an excellent connection ground.</p><li> Do you respond to posts you enjoy?</li><li> Do you relay why you enjoyed the post to create a bond?</li><li> On occasion do you extend the invitation to connect by email, phone or Skype?</li><p> These connections may be viewed as a part of your sales pipeline. And so it would be smart to devote a little time each day to review your in-boxes to see if there is an individual with an interesting message. Then make it a habit to respond immediately before the connection gets lost in the cloud.</p><h3> Sales Tips: <br/>  </h3><li> Glance through the Twitter home page to see what catches your eye.</li><li> Upon receiving LinkedIn invitations see whose work is of the most interest.</li><li> Look at responses on your Facebook page(s) to see if a conversation is ready to go.</li><li> If there is a Pin on Pinterest, reach out to the pinner.</li><li> Should you enjoy a video on YouTube, let the person know.</li><li> Follow-up with those you meet socially.</li><li> Check email for the more intriguing notices.</li><li> Research industries for companies that you like.</li><li> Reconnect with people from the past by asking if they would be interested in an exchange of updates.</li><li> At least monthly exchange news with your closer friends.</li>",

    "link": "do-you-know-the-five-basic-steps-of-the-scientific-method-to-help-your-business",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> When running your business, it can come in handy to trust your gut instinct and rely on your intuition. <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s important when reading people. It&rsquo;s important when being creative. It&rsquo;s important in a multitude of circumstances.</p><p> It has its limits, though. At a certain point, you need to start testing and measuring so you know what really is working instead of what feels like it&rsquo;s working. That&rsquo;s why we at Startup Connection recommend learning how the scientific method can help your business.</p><h3> How the scientific method can help your business? Science class was a long time ago. What is it again exactly? <br/>  </h3><p> The five basic steps of the scientific method are:</p><p> 1) make observations</p><p> 2) propose a hypothesis</p><p> 3) design and perform an experiment to test the hypothesis</p><p> 4) analyze the data to see if it supports the hypothesis</p><p> 5) propose and test a new hypothesis based on these findings. The scientific method is the basic set of actions that scientists use to make new discoveries and prove theories correct or incorrect</p><h3> Why it works <br/>  </h3><p> Again, we&rsquo;re not here to tell you to ignore your intuition or passion. It&rsquo;s an important part of business, and often you&rsquo;ll intuitively sense something that you&rsquo;ll later prove to be true after rigorous testing. But, here&rsquo;s the thing:  your assumptions are not always going to be correct, and the ones that are wrong can cost you dearly.</p><p> For example, maybe you feel like Facebook ads will bring in business, so you invest a huge portion of your budget in there. If you aren&rsquo;t measuring those results and adjusting your hypothesis accordingly, you could spend thousands and thousands of dollars before it&rsquo;s clear that you made a mistake.</p><br /><p> If you instead created a small-scale test run with Facebook ads &ndash; using a limited budget and testing several variables like copy, graphics, and target audience &ndash; you could have more answers in a week than you would if you solely followed your gut feeling for two months. Maybe, you&rsquo;ll discover that Facebook ads were a bad choice all together. Maybe, you&rsquo;ll discover that only certain images work well. Either way, by testing it scientifically, you&rsquo;ll have more information in a shorter amount of time, and you can use that information to optimize what you&rsquo;re doing.</p><p> With the scientific method, you&rsquo;ll have a track record of results, and can use it to make future decisions.</p><p> When it&rsquo;s a big spot in a baseball game, the manager who pinch-hits a guy with incredible production against a certain pitcher is much more likely to get a positive result than the manager who puts a guy on who &ldquo;felt like&rdquo; he&rsquo;d get a hit.</p><h3> Things to note <br/>  </h3><p> Using the scientific method for your business isn&rsquo;t just as easy as doing a few tests. To do it effectively, you have to be cognizant of some of the ways the scientific method can be undermined.</p><p> Firstly, beware of personal bias and seek to minimize it. When you go into an experiment, it&rsquo;s only human to assume that a certain result is going to occur. Be careful, though!  It&rsquo;s easy to interpret data in a way that supports your preconceived notion, which throws off the integrity of the experiment. Be sure to stay as objective as possible.  Remember, it&rsquo;s not about being right; it&rsquo;s about finding what works so you can be successful.</p><p> Secondly, remember that life is random, and its randomness can throw off your results. If you draw conclusions too early with too small of a sample size, you might not be identifying an actual cause-and-effect relationship. Early on, there are many factors that contribute to a result, so be sure to collect enough data for your results to become consistent and predictable.</p><h3> The results are limitless <br/>  </h3><p> Science is having a dramatic impact in basketball. Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors are revolutionizing the game of basketball after winning the NBA championship by shooting more 3-point shots than ever. As a result, other pro teams, and even college and high school teams, are shooting more 3-pointers as well. As long you make even 20 percent fewer threes than twos, the probabilities are in your favor to shoot threes. Intuition still plays a role because some players forget you still have to make some threes and keep shooting them, regardless of success.</p><h3></h3><p> We are not saying that intuition and creativity should be completely replaced by statistics and science.</p><p> In fact, the first phase of the scientific method is the intuitive development of the hypothesis. Rather, we are saying you need the scientific method and facts to help support, validate, and confirm the hypothesis. In short, as one of my colleagues always said, &ldquo;Get the facts before the facts get you.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Michigan Radio recently carried a story about Judge Peter O&rsquo;Connell, a judge suing the state Bureau of Elections claiming age discrimination. The judge, currently 67 years old, would be too old to run for re-election when his current six-year term ends in January 2019. <br/>  </h3><p> As the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission explains, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) prohibits discrimination against employees and job applicants aged 40 and over. While this prohibition seems like a sound policy on its face, age discrimination is very hard to prove.</p><p> While Judge O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s case is certainly interesting from a legal standpoint, it begs a broader question: what&rsquo;s wrong with older employees? Why do we need explicit protections like the ADEA, and why do so many older employees and applicants struggle to enforce their rights under the law?</p><p> Michigan Radio quotes Judge O&rsquo;Connell making two compelling arguments. \"I love my job. I'm very good, in my opinion, at my job,\" said O'Connell. \"And I'm not ready to be put out to pasture;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Seventy is the new 50.&rdquo;</p><p> Often in the discussion of the benefits of inclusion, thoughts focus on race, ethnicity and culture. But age diversity is also an important element of a diverse workforce.</p><p> There are real benefits to employing older workers. Last year, U.S. News published &ldquo; <u>  Five Reasons Employers Should Hire More Workers Over Age 50. </u> &rdquo;</p><h3> Those reasons were the following: <br/>  </h3><li> Older workers have experience: Obviously, if you&rsquo;ve had more time on the job, you&rsquo;re going to have more experience &mdash; and that&rsquo;s valuable for a number of reasons.</li><li> Older workers have confidence: Simply put, experience breeds confidence.</li><li> Older workers provide reliable service: The article quotes AARP Jobs Expert Kerry Hannon: &ldquo;They actually show up on time, and they aren&rsquo;t texting all day.&rdquo;</li><li> Older workers are loyal: Older employees tend to have greater job satisfaction and fewer family and social conflicts with work.</li><li> Older workers can save money: They take less time to train and can help bring younger employees up to speed more quickly, reducing the total payroll cost to develop talent.</li><p> Inclusiveness in the business world isn&rsquo;t about doing the right thing. Altruism is great, but at the end of the day, a business is there to make money. And just as there are real, bottom-line-driving benefits to hire a workforce that is diverse, racially and culturally, there are tangible benefits to hiring an age-diverse workforce.</p><p> Be inclusive!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Dave Gedeon </u> / Head of Research &amp; Development, <u>  Nasdaq Global Indexes </u></p><p> Although recent interest in factor-based investing would lead one to believe that this is a new-fangled trend, the truth is factor-based investing has existed for decades. In fact, it has been a key component in the stock selection framework of active managers for years. At its core, factor-based investing involves identifying characteristics in a group of securities that help explain its risk/return profile. For example, value investing is a factor-based strategy that focuses on a subset of stocks that displays attractive valuation metrics relative to the general market. Thanks to smart beta, investors today can gain exposure to this factor and a wide array of others with ease, in a transparent and low cost vehicle.</p><p> These well-known investment factors have become the guiding philosophy behind a large swath of smart beta products. Third party research1 indicates that these factors deliver results with returns in excess of market capitalization strategies over the long run. Each individual factor may not outperform every year, but over time the factors can provide a superior risk/return profile to the broad market. Moreover, factor strategies tend to display low correlation with each other as each is driven by a different set of risk factors.</p><p> There are many factors at an investor&rsquo;s disposal, and the explanations of investment returns are limitless. The five factors of focus in this piece are Volatility, Momentum,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3BlspnNxzg&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLqDHF2tkRWOq7GcaLJtlD2u7PKZe-T02R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quality  </a> </u> , Size and Value. Perhaps more important than the explanation of the factors is an investor&rsquo;s ability to select a factor that is favorable in certain market environments or even to combine several factors into a single portfolio.</p><p> <strong>  Low volatility.  </strong> The concept of low volatility or low beta is simple yet powerful. A portfolio comprised of stocks with lower volatility when compared to its benchmark can produce higher risk-adjusted returns and generally produce a superior information ratio over all periods. This factor becomes increasingly potent in times of market strife such as witnessed in 2008.</p><p> <strong>  Momentum. </strong>  This factor is generally viewed as the opposite of volatility. A relative strength or momentum strategy picks stocks that have historically outperformed the market as studies show that this outperformance is likely to continue in the short to medium term.  <u>  <a href=\"http://dorseywright.com/research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Much research  </a> </u>  has been done on this factor, and it is important to be able to harness momentum in the right market environment.</p><p> <strong>  Quality.  </strong> The notion of quality has gained steam during the economic recovery and U.S. equity bull market since 2009. Quality focuses on factors such as equity return, leverage ratio, and earnings variability. This factor can exhibit strong returns over time as the companies that fit this mold have consistent track records.</p><p> <strong>  Value.  </strong> One of the originally identified smart beta factors is value which seeks to identify the disconnect between a company&rsquo;s stock price and its intrinsic value. Ratios such as price to earnings and price-to-book are used to take advantage of this disconnect.</p><p> <strong>  Size.  </strong> Smaller capitalization stocks tend to outperform over the long run. The key notion here is that smaller capitalization stocks within a benchmark tend to outperform the larger capitalization stocks within that same benchmark.</p><h3> <strong>  Portfolios of Factor Exposures </strong></h3><p> <br/> The interest in factor exposures has provided investors with the opportunity to not only focus on asset class diversification, but to also build a diversified portfolio of factor exposures. For example, for more defensive positioning, managers can create a simple blend of the three least volatile factors: low volatility, quality and value. A less risk-averse outlook can create a portfolio in which all five factors are equally weighted. If an investor is particularly aggressive, the blend would emphasize the two highest volatility factors: momentum and size.</p><p> Of course the question asked is &ldquo;How do I utilize each factor in a consistent manner?&rdquo; As recent articles have pointed out, all of these factors have exhibited outperformance over the market during the past 20 years. Though to realize that outperformance an investor would have to ride through the ups and downs of the long market cycle. The easiest answer to the question is to throw the factors into a Nutribullet and blend away.</p><h3> <strong>  The Best Recipe for Blending Factors </strong></h3><p> <br/> Multi-factor solutions have been created lately to blend the benefits of each factor into a single investment strategy. The concept is pretty simple: select the companies that have the highest factor attribution of the main factors and blend them together into a single index. While often these multi-factor strategies can outperform the benchmark, there is still the risk that the index is not properly defining the timing and best usage of an individual factor. The multi-factor blend is a strategic asset allocation, a basic catchall strategy that looks great on paper. We&rsquo;ve moved to a tactical world so strategies must follow suit.</p><p> Our favored approach, instead, is to take advantage of the most powerful factor, momentum, and apply that factor as the selection overlay to the other factors: size, volatility, value and growth. The goal is to utilize the momentum signal as the basis for deciding which factor is in favor in the market. That selected factor will then be the single exposure for the index as long as the factor is in favor. The result is a &ldquo;momentum + factor model&rdquo; that will take advantage of momentum plus the most favored factor.</p><p> This methodology is rooted in an objective relative strength ranking of the factors' price performance each month which results in rebalancing each month. By rotating between these factors, the index will focus on the favored factor and take advantage of particular market trends. Examples are aplenty, whether it is Low Volatility exposure from July 2008 to March 2009 or Pure Value exposure from August 2012 to December 2013 resulting in a 60% gain in the underlying strategy value.</p><p> When looking to gain exposure to factors it is important to know how to combine them together. A blended approach is a simple solution but does not fully capture the benefit of relative strength selecting the factors.</p><p> Utilizing a relative strength overlay on powerful single factors drastically improves return and lowers volatility yielding a strong information ratio. This investment thesis also solves the problem of when to be invested and for how long. Taking the guesswork out of factors prevents riding the ups and downs of each known factor and instead pivots the exposure to the right factor at the right time, for the right amount of time.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"127\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-10.02.19-AM.png\" width=\"777\"/></p><p> <a href=\"http://q.nasdaq.com/GIG_ContactUs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Null\" src=\"http://business.nasdaq.com/Images/5%20Factors%20graph_tcm5044-26358.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> All values back-tested, exclude dividends and are rebalanced at each month-end.

Five of these factors are Momentum, Volatility, Quality, Size, and Value. Multi-factor approaches to smart beta include a combination of a number of factors in a one-ticker solution. As great as multi-factor products can be, tactical rotation products (products that can rotate in or out of products in a rules-based, transparent fashion) tend to outperform given their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics. At Nasdaq, we believe highly in the momentum factor. Over the long term, momentum with an additional factor is one form of factor rotation that has performed quite impressively over the last 13 years. Tactical factor rotation is the newest smart beta trend, one which we expect to perpetuate for years to come.</p><p> For more information, please  <u>  <a href=\"http://qnasdaqomx.com/licensingcontactus?source=MarketInsite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   contact us  </a> </u>  here and a member of our team will reach out to you directly.</p>Nasdaq&reg; is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

    "content": "<h3> For years now, as content marketing has braised in ubiquity and flirted with saturation, most marketers have felt growing pressure to produce volumes of searchable, shareable, Mashable, HuffPost-able, and Buzzfeed-able content to capture fleeting looks and attention from an increasingly distracted audience. <br/>  </h3><p> Amid our tireless listicle creation, we've fought a parallel battle with the voice inside ourselves making a very compelling argument that less is more, and that quality trumps quantity.</p><p> We know instinctively that the path to content righteousness should lie in authenticity, value, and originality&mdash;but many of us have succumbed to the pressure of hollow metrics and competitive paranoia:</p><li> \"Our page views are down? Better post a top 10!\"</li><li> \"The competition is getting more likes than we are! Create another video!\"</li><li> \"Our search ranking did what? Double the keyword mentions in your next blog!\" <br/>  </li><p> In a self-perpetuating quest to outpace ourselves, we've inadvertently solved for an abstraction instead of solving for the real objective: to build a more intimate relationship with our customers through content.</p><h3> Here are three ways that every content marketer can bring back intimacy into the customer journey. <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Connect the product creators directly with the product consumers </strong></h3><p> <br/> This way is about authenticity and credibility. It's particularly important in industries like IT, where the marketers frequently don't resemble the personas they're marketing to. </p><p> As a marketer, if you're not a true expert in your product or technology, and if you don't resemble your target persona, the content you create will always be marginally inauthentic or, in the worst case, inaccurate. You can choose from two options to overcome this:</p><li> You can invest hundreds of hours becoming a product expert.</li><li> You can change the communication path entirely. <br/>  </li><p> The most direct path to authenticity is to connect your product creators directly to the users of the product, so they can have more meaningful conversations. This needs to go way beyond farming out a few blog posts to the engineers. It's got to be a sustainable, direct connection that creates a continuous exchange of value for both sides.</p><p> Increase focus and investment on employee advocacy and on building continuous, direct connections between the product creators and the product consumers, so they can communicate and exchange value in their authentic voices.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make 'value' the focus of your engagement strategy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Like authenticity, engagement is another marketing buzzword that gets applied a bit more liberally than it should. There's no question we want to engage our customers more intimately and more frequently&mdash;but how?</p><p> In my experience, value (and specifically the consistent exchange of value) is the cornerstone of the optimal engagement strategy. Deliver tangible value to the audience so that they seek you out and interact with more and more content on a lifelong journey.</p><p> Though listicles and controversial headlines may attract fleeting eyeballs, content that provides unique value ultimately begets engagement. The challenge we face as marketers is that this kind of value-content seems so daunting to create. Drafting off a trending topic with some loosely connected snack-caliber content piece is much easier than building something your audience really needs. But it's worth the effort&mdash;more than ever&mdash;as we see true originality and quality getting applauded and shared while the shallower content increasingly gets passed over.</p><p> Focus the content you create on providing practical value to your audience. I've resolved to forsake lists, advertorials, and keyword-ridden blog posts in favor of value-centric content. I will spend a little more time on each content program to keep it original and keep it valuable.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Tell your stories for longer and go deeper </strong></h3><p> <br/> A chicken-and-egg question occurred to me recently as I was trying to figure out why some of the blogs, podcasts, and sites I've been loyal to for years have been so successful. Is their success the reason they've had longevity&mdash;or is it their longevity that eventually lead to their success?</p><p> The answer to this question is not as obvious as it first appears. The more I think about it, the more I feel compelled to build more long-term, consistent content programs in the future.</p><p> Audiences find value in consistency, and they find comfort in continuity. Here's an example: I hear my partner listen to Bill Cunningham's On the Street every Sunday... and now I catch myself humming the intro music while I'm making breakfast. Like all content, sometimes the episodes are great and sometimes they're only OK, but you can set your watch by it. You expect it.</p><p> Consistency for a content marketer is critical to success. It can turn a unique visitor into a customer. And, when you're not at your best, the loyalty it creates can be an insurance policy for your sub-par content. As content marketers, I think we too often submit to the pressure to innovate at the expense of building consistency and longevity into our programs.</p><p> Content marketers need to focus on building longer-term programs designed to give their audience something they can count on. We may have to sacrifice the pace at which we introduce new things, but it will pay off in the end.</p> ",

Often, there is no one else &ndash; you are the guy in charge and you have to make the choices that no one else can make for you.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html\" target=\"_blank\">   There is plenty of research out there  </a> </u>  that points to an overwhelming conclusion: when faced with too many choices, we break down and resort to &ldquo;the default&rdquo;. When we panic, we freeze &ndash; meaning we don&rsquo;t choose at all.</p><p> When it comes to making decisions, things are pretty much the same. When there are too many factors to consider (like when you&rsquo;re starting up a business), the temptation is huge to put off making choices or resort to the default.</p><p> Now, I am all for getting things done quickly and being as efficient as possible and often the default option can be the best one. I have learnt to make decisions quickly, by relying on gut instinct as much as hard data.</p><p> To trust the wisdom of the crowd or rely on others&rsquo; input. And to quickly scan the environment and &ndash; say &ndash; ask for a few opinions when I need to make a hard call.</p><p> But every so often it pays to be a little obsessive. Steve Jobs was more than a little obsessive. Santiago Calatrava is. And no doubt the person that first coined the phrase &ldquo;the devil is in the details&rdquo; was.</p><p> In fact, probably everyone who has had a certain amount of success in life was obsessive about certain things. Like quality. Or efficiency. Or getting things done.</p><h3> <strong>  Or shoes. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many years ago, we had a shoe repair shop close to our house. The owner was Spanish, but looked Italian, dressed Italian and even spoke with a slight Italian-sounding accent. The man was obsessive about shoes. I am not talking merely enthusiastic. No &ndash; I am talking outright obsessive. He could tell you everything about where the leather for his shoes came from, why this particular type of sole was better than another and how to care for shoes so they last for years and years. Why it was important to have several types of shoes, in different colors and what to combine with which color suit and tie. When to go formal and when you could probably get away with a little fantasy on the side.</p><p> I absolutely loved spending time there, in this little shop on the corner. I loved talking about shoes, and became a loyal customer of his for many years. His obsessiveness and attention to minute detail made me feel that &ndash; when it came to shoes &ndash; there was nobody better suited to advise me than this man.</p><p> I still love spending time with people who are a little obsessive. Who take the time to talk about the intricacies of their craft, and speak with passion. Who are out to make a difference, no matter how small or big. Who can&rsquo;t seem to leave well enough alone, but are always looking for that extra bit.</p><p> Who refuse to compromise, or take the easy way out.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s world of instant gratification, an emphasis on cost and what seems to be a never ending race to the bottom when it comes to purchasing patterns, the future seems bleak for those who put the emphasis on quality over quantity or profit.</p><p> But then again, Apple just keeps rolling. Perhaps, as Robert Frost once said &ldquo;I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference&rdquo;?</p><h3> <strong>  Here is to the obsessive ones. </strong></h3>",

People who come into money need good advice to turn their money into wealth.</p><p> &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never been in that situation before, and it can be quite shocking,&rdquo; said Morningstar behavioral economist Sarah Newcomb, Ph.D., author of the forthcoming book Loaded: Money, Psychology, and How to Get Ahead without Leaving Your Values Behind.</p><p> To help advisors navigate new-money situations and talk about them with clients and prospects, we asked Newcomb about the psychology behind new-money behavior, and how advisors can help. </p><h3> <img alt=\"\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-25-at-10.04.11-AM.png\" width=\"737\"/> <br/> <br/> Help your clients learn to save for larger savings goals by starting to save for smaller savings goals.</h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Money turns up the volume on everything,&rdquo; Newcomb said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look at someone just coming out of college. Suddenly you find yourself with a paycheck that&rsquo;s bigger than you&rsquo;ve ever had before, and you don&rsquo;t quite know what to do. One of the biggest things to recognize is that you&rsquo;re now going to have a lot more ways to either do great things or get yourself in trouble.</p><p> &ldquo;If all your extra money and all your extra time during college was spent in certain ways, then just having a new job isn&rsquo;t necessarily going to change the way that you&rsquo;re spending money. It&rsquo;s just going to give you more opportunity to spend more in the same old ways.&rdquo;</p><p> For advisors, breaking down bad habits and demonstrating the need for early career long-term planning can cement client relationships and build the trust that&rsquo;s crucial to every advisory relationship.</p><p> Read the rest of <u>  <a href=\"http://mscomm.morningstar.com/newmoney/?adid=ADV_ADV_Advisorpedia_BLOG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Financial Turning Points: New Money, Old Habits  </a> </u> . </p><p> To learn more about Morningstar, please visit us <a href=\"http://corporate1.morningstar.com/US/How-Morningstar-Helps-Financial-Advisors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>",

Joyless professionals transactingtheir way through the process.</p><p> I had an eye surgery a week ago to take care of a retina detachment. The surgery was a success, the eye is healing fine. As part of my pre- and post-surgery process, I was seen by 6 of the top retina specialists in South Florida. No kidding, 6.</p><p> Every one of these gents is good at what he does. In this group, expertise is not a differentiator. Yes, some of them have better social skills than others. All of them are crisp, efficient, highly knowledgeable professionals. All of them execute well.</p><p> Not once did I feel that any of them were actually happy to engage with me.</p><h3> Transactional competence. Joyless execution.</h3><p> <br/> I think of the year I spearheaded a peace project for Shimon Peres and his Center for Peace. An hour before a large gala event we were hosting in the only 5-star hotel in Ramallah/Palestine, Mr. Peres walks into a private meeting room for a meet-and-greet with about 25 top Palestinian officials. I observe Mr. Peres, in awe. He has clearly conducted thousands of these meet-and-greets in his life time. He maneuvers with a relaxed ease and charm. He shows up with a sense of polish. He is attentive to the nuances of the moment. He is fresh. He is present.</p><p> Transactional, yes. And I have undeniable sense that Mr. Peres is enjoying himself.</p><p> Beyond transactional doesn&rsquo;t mean spewing social pleasantries. It doesn&rsquo;t mean acting &ldquo;nice.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t mean being ra-ra happy. I don&rsquo;t trust anyone who is ra-ra happy all the time.</p><p> It means finding the joy of being in that moment, with that person, even when it&rsquo;s a person I may not much like, a conversation I don&rsquo;t wish to have.</p><h3> Want to lift your everyday game?</h3><p> <br/> Snap out of transactional. Know your inner enjoyment button. Press it. Vigorously. Often. Until it becomes the way you show up, every time.</p><p> It&rsquo;s what great leaders do. Why not?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/author/kforst/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Kelly Forst  </a> </u></p><h3> Much like college basketball in March, the financial services arena is experiencing its own sort of madness in the registered investment adviser (RIA) space.</h3><p> <br/> Merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity within the industry has reached an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/news/industry/ria-m-a-deal-volume-and-size-hit-record-highs-2696129-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   all-time peak  </a> </u> , and firms are left with no choice but to eat or be eaten.</p><p> According to  <u>  DeVoe &amp; Company&rsquo;s annual review </u> , M&amp;A activity among RIAs set a record-breaking high of 123 transactions in 2015, exceeding 2014&rsquo;s record by 37 percent. In fact, the industry saw an enormous uptick in the number of &ldquo;mega-deals,&rdquo; transactions that involve sellers with more than $5 billion in AUM. A growing number of sellers is largely driving the uptick in activity as aging baby boomer firm owners seek retirement. This trend is expected to continue, and it&rsquo;s possible we could watch the consolidation of the RIA space unfold before our eyes.</p><p> It&rsquo;s now up to you, the RIA, to adapt or perish. How can you ensure your firm stands out in an industry of giants? Candidly, the average RIA can learn a great deal by taking a page or two out of the college basketball playbook. Will your firm eke out to become the next Cinderella story?</p><p> Here are three tips to improve your chances:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Go full court press on content: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Having a blog and utilizing social media to share content is no longer optional. Social media not only encourages interaction and communication with clients, it allows RIAs to meet new ones and stay in touch with industry news. It should also go hand-in-hand with your blogging strategy. A well-thought-out blog should serve as a hub of activity that drives thought leadership and steers traffic to your site. Not sure where to begin? Follow these  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/5-blogging-commandments-for-financial-services-firms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   5 blogging commandments for financial services firms  </a> </u>  to get started.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make recruiting part of your game plan: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Just as coaches need to spend time scouting fresh talent, the advisory industry needs to follow suit as the adviser workforce ages. As baby boomers get older, there&rsquo;s a huge opportunity to hire young talent entering the industry. RIAs need to spend time recruiting to stay ahead of the curve by attracting and retaining younger advisors. It will also help serve millennial clients, as they continue  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/4-truths-about-millennials-that-might-shock-rias/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   to represent  </a> </u>  a growing market in financial services.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Hop on the bandwagon: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Are colleagues, competitors or others in the industry attending or speaking at an upcoming event? Make sure you&rsquo;re there too &ndash; there&rsquo;s no better way to keep an ear to the ground while having a voice in the conversations that are shaping the industry. More than that, use headlines to your advantage and make your voice heard. Take for instance, why  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gregoryfca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gregory FCA  </a> </u>  clients are keeping a finger on the pulse of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialservicesmarketing.com/rias/pr-lessons-from-the-presidential-campaign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   the election  </a> </u>  to know how candidates&rsquo; positions will impact their businesses. Being able to jump into the news cycle or a conversation about trending topics will set your RIA apart from the pack.</p><p> If RIAs want to survive in an environment of accelerating consolidation, they need to better prepare and adapt to the future industry landscape. <strong>  It&rsquo;s time to dance. </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m sure there are many reasons people avoid using their real names or photos of themselves on a Facebook page or profile as they set them up.  Perhaps they are wanted by the FBI, their high school reunion coordinator, or their mother. This mistrust of Facebook and any other social media site, causes people to want to wear a mask and set up a pseudonyms to protect their identity while they wander around the &ldquo;social&rdquo; web.  Kind of ironic when you think of it.  </p><p> Many who have avoided Facebook all these years, feeling rather smug about bypassing the bandwagon that everyone seems to have jumped on, are now realizing they are truly left behind when it comes to business marketing.  After all, you can avoid the bandwagon all you want, but if your customers have all jumped on it, you are left standing in your puddle of pride&hellip;alone.</p><h3> Here are Types of People Avoiding Setting Up a Facebook Page Correctly. <br/>  </h3><h3> <img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-27-at-8.50.38-AM.png\" width=\"415\"/></h3><h3> <br/> The 2-Faced, Facebook User</h3><p> <br/> There are people who enjoy using their social media profiles with their own names, but when it comes time to create a business page or profile, there is a fear of connecting that business profile to the personal profile.  This causes people to break the rules of Facebook and some create a second personal profile with their real name but they use a work email. They plan to use this profile strictly to manage the business page.  they just don&rsquo;t realize that anyone searching for them will now find two profiles and it causes problems. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-27-at-8.50.42-AM.png\" width=\"412\"/></p><h3> The Masked Business, Facebook User</h3><p> <br/> Then there are those who break another Facebook rule and they create a personal profile using a business name.  From that profile they create a legitimate business page.  This is usually done all using the business email for that personal profile and anyone needing to access it, simply logs in using the single email.  The problem with this scenario is you are giving everyone a single login password which is risky, and like the scenario above, it causes confusion when a customer searches Facebook for your business and finds two entries, a personal profile and a business page.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-27-at-8.50.47-AM.png\" width=\"413\"/></p><h3> The Bound Business, Facebook User</h3><p> <br/> There is an option to create a business page as a business account, solely using a business email, and not attaching any personal profiles at all.  The page is set up but then the person trying to actually use the page to connect with others, comment on other pages and post realizes they have very limited functions available to that page.</p><p> One thing to note. Facebook is a free service (many will now argue this fact since we must pay to promote many posts to have them seen by your target user) and their revenue comes from advertising.  When you log into your business page you are not seeing ads down the right hand side.  Only when you log into your personal profile are you flooded with ads.  This is one of the reasons I believe Facebook wants everyone starting from their personal profile and then jumping over to manage a business page. </p><p> So what&rsquo;s a person to do?  How can you maintain your own personal Facebook connections with your friends and crazy relatives, while managing a business page for your business or a company page where you work? Even if you are simply setting up a page for someone else and then you want to remove yourself, follow these steps:</p><h3> How to correctly set up a business page using your personal profile. <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Create a personal profile (if you are one of those who have been standing in your puddle of pride and are just now creating your own profile). </strong>  Even if you don&rsquo;t intend to use your personal profile for networking, create your profile and then set the privacy settings tight.  If you already have a personal profile move to step 2. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  After logging into your personal profile, go to Facebook.com/pages to begin creating your business page. </strong>  You will select the category for your business page that best matches the type of organization you have.  Don&rsquo;t lose any sleep on this step, as you can change this later in your business page settings. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Be sure to fill in the ABOUT section for your business with a link to your website, ways to contact you or the business, hours of operation (if that is appropriate), and more. </strong>  This is where you will put the email address and or phone number that you want your business audience to use.  It may be completely different from the information you use on your personal profile.   <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Load some content with visuals. </strong>  Like moving into a new house, decorate a bit before inviting everyone over. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Now start inviting people to like your new page. </strong>  This is where you decide whether or not to invite your personal contacts or simply start from scratch inviting people your business is trying to connect with.  (see our post on &ldquo;4 Tips for Better Social Media Management&rdquo; to build that page from scratch) <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  Now when you log into your personal profile you will see the business page that you manage in the lefthand column of your home page. </strong>  You can also find pages you manage in the drop down gear icon in the upper right of your page.  I suggest going to your business page from the gear icon, because it automatically changes your identity from personal profile to your business page identity.  Anything you post on the page from there is seen as coming from your business, not from you personally.  The only way anyone would know that it is you posting, or that you are even connected to the page, is if you tell them, or if you comment as yourself, which you can do by going from the left column and selecting &ldquo;Post as Gina Schreck (your name) once on the page (look at the top, right under your business page name).  This will post your comment on this business page, as well as showing that post on your personal profile since you posted as yourself. <br/>  </li><li> <strong>  The last step is to add another person on this business page for security purposes. </strong>  If you ever got locked out of your Facebook account, or penalized for something (there are things that can cause Facebook to throw you in Facebook jail for 24-48 hours or longer.  See my experience here) you want someone else to be able to login and post for the business.  If anything ever happened to you, like missing work because Nordstrom had a 3-day sale in their shoe department, or you decided to move to a remote island, you must have someone else on the page who can log in and post for the business.  Adding others as a page admin, also allows you to remove yourself if you ever leave, and the page remains in tact with the other admins running it. <br/>  </li><p> We know that Facebook is a powerful way for businesses to connect, get feedback and build business from their target audiences, but it does take work.  Take the time to set up your account correctly.  Plan your content to be interesting and helpful, and don&rsquo;t give up too quickly.  It takes work AND time!  Let us know if you have any questions, or if we can help you manage the daily activities that will grow your online presence and business.</p>",

    "link": "steve-jobss-greatest-regret-his-family",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's biographer, asked him if he had any regrets.</p><h3> Jobs said, \"I wanted my kids to know me. I wasn't always there for them, and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did.\"</h3><p> <br/> Isaacson went on to ask him if he was glad that he had kids, and Jobs said, \"It's 10,000 times better than anything I've ever done.\"</p><p> Steve Jobs, the man who many consider as one of the greatest business innovators of our time, placed the value of having kids as 10,000 times greater than anything he's ever done. Yet, his biggest regret is that he wasn't there for them and he wanted them to know why.</p><p> Most people go into parenthood with good intentions. They want their kids to succeed and be happy and healthy. But life often gets in the way of good intentions.</p><p> Bills have to be paid and you find yourself working too hard and becoming too busy to attend your son's baseball games. You get a divorce and spend a year fighting over custody while your kids ping pong between mom's and dad's house and get in with the wrong crowd. You push your daughter to do her best in school and one day she storms out with her tattoo-covered boyfriend proclaiming you an \"overbearing ogre!\" You try to give your kids the kind of emotional support they need, but your parents were always cold and distant and you just don't know how to connect.</p><p> Without the right model, it can be tough. Really tough.</p><p> Still, creating a successful family culture isn't impossible. In fact, with the right structure, your family legacy can be something great. But, it doesn't happen by accident. You have to think it through, make it a priority and act in ways that are supportive to cultivating a happy, healthy family.</p><h3> <strong>  Benefits of Family Legacy Planning: </strong></h3><p> <br/> The aim of a solid family legacy plan is to mold family members who are:</p><li> <strong>  Capable. </strong> Members know their role in the family and contribute to the financial, social, spiritual and intellectual health of their family and the community.</li><li> <strong>  Connected. </strong> Members care about their ancestors, extended family and descendants. They work hard to stay connected to the family and establish effective generational governance structures.</li><li> <strong>  Grateful. </strong> Members recognize the many blessings and opportunities they have been given and focus on empowering each family member to become the very best.</li><li> <strong>  Responsible. </strong> Members are accountable for their actions and mistakes and embrace their responsibility to give back.</li><li> <strong>  Competent. </strong> Members develop the skills to handle and manage money, effectively utilize opportunities, and become productive, giving members of society.  <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Components of a Successful Family Legacy Plan: </strong></h3><p> <br/> With a little planning, a vision for the future, and a lot of love, you can turn your \"mediocre\" family experience into \"extraordinary\". Let's take a quick look at what you need to consider when constructing a Family Legacy Plan.</p><h3> Your Family Values:</h3><p> <br/> It is essential to identify joint family values and establish a home that outlines and supports what your family stands for.</p><h3> Your Family Mission, Vision and Mantra:</h3><p> <br/> This will serve as the foundation for your family&mdash;the rock upon which your children can build their decisions.</p><h3> Your Family Coat of Arms:</h3><p> <br/> This doesn't need to be fancy, but it could be. (I have access to the royal sculptor for Windsor Castle, if you want to go that route.) Brainstorm ideas about a unique coat of arms or logo that will represent your family. We've found this component, when done right, can be extremely valuable to your family because it gives them a tangible identity&mdash;something they can see and connect with.</p><h3> Documenting Family Systems:</h3><p> <br/> List traditions to be passed down from generation to generation, systems for maintaining a healthy body, systems for managing money, business systems, and other knowledge that should be passed on. We teach our clients how to get the kids and other family members involved in creating a family knowledge base.</p><h3> Your Family Constitution:</h3><p> <br/> It may seem overly formal to some, but a family constitution can help solve major problems down the road by outlining the specific principles and precedents your family agrees to follow. While the vision and mission of your family is more of an overview, your family constitution lists specific rules that will be followed and respected. This isn't about creating a \"police state\" family. It's about setting clear expectations and establishing accountability and responsibility&mdash;crucial skills your children need to function at the highest level as adults. When everyone knows what is expected of them and that other members of the family care about their well-being and will hold them accountable for making poor choices (also praise them for making good choices!), they have incentive to avoid foolish actions and reach higher levels of self awareness.</p><h3> Yearly Family Goals:</h3><p> <br/> Each year, I would suggest you create a family theme as well as a concrete goal you'd like to accomplish together. How you want to implement your family goals depends on how your family interacts, ages of various members and interest. This is about having fun and growing and learning in a laid back environment.</p><h3> Weekly Family Meetings:</h3><p> <br/> In his book, The Secrets of Happy Families, Bruce Feiler writes about how a simple 20-minute weekly family meeting transformed his relationship with his teenage daughters. For the first couple meetings, his daughters were emotionally closed off and non-communicative. Then, they began to open up in a very big way. A good family meeting stimulates conversation, promotes love and creates a family that is more cohesive. If done right, your family meetings can be a fun, enjoyable time everyone looks forward to. This is also a time to address the day-to-day operations of the family and establish some routines.</p><h3> Archiving and Passing On Intellectual and Character Assets:</h3><p> <br/> Figure out how you want to share memories, document experiences and stories, compile meaningful family information and save it all in a way that won't be lost or forgotten.</p><h3> <strong>  Living Without Regret </strong></h3><p> <br/> No family or system will ever be perfect, but creating a plan for your family keeps your most-important priorities from slipping through the cracks. One day, at the end of your life, someone may ask you what was your greatest regret. Hopefully it doesn't result in the gut-wrenching realization that the thing that mattered most got the least attention. </p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Donald Liebenson </u>  | <a href=\"http://millionairecorner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Millionaire Corner  </u> </a></p><h3> The foundation of trust is a gatekeeper&rsquo;s personal knowledge of an advisor.  <br/>  </h3><p> <br/> Trustworthiness is the primary criteria by which Affluent investors select a new financial advisor, according to Spectrem Group research. The same is true for the &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo; who recommend financial advisors to their clients. A gatekeeper is a professional such as an attorney or an accountant who is assisting an investor with specialized assistance. When they identify that their clients would benefit from the services of a financial planner, they will make a referral to their clients.</p><p> <u>  Spectrem Group </u> &rsquo;s research study,  <u>  <a href=\"http://spectrem.com/Content_Product/gatekeepers-influence-referrals-wealth-transfer.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gatekeepers: Their Influence on Referrals and Wealth Transfer  </a> </u>  includes interviews with accountants and attorneys who reflect on how these connections made and their criteria for recommending advisors, networking, and monitoring to ensure that their clients are being well-served.</p><h3> Gatekeepers primarily consider client referrals to be a service to their clients.</h3><p> <br/> As such, they must ensure that the advisor they recommend is a good match for their client. Financial professionals work hard to earn and maintain their clients&rsquo; trust, so when it comes to recommending a financial advisor, they want to be certain that advisor will not betray that trust.</p><p> &ldquo;I am not a financial advisor,&rdquo; one accountant told us. &ldquo;I understand finances, but I&rsquo;m not licensed for that type of service, so I don&rsquo;t provide it.&rdquo; Said another, &ldquo;I want (the advisor) to take care of (my clients). Because whatever they say to my clients reflects on me.&rdquo;</p><p> The foundation of trust is a gatekeeper&rsquo;s personal knowledge of an advisor. &ldquo;I always meet with them,&rdquo; one told us. &ldquo;I will never refer someone to someone I haven&rsquo;t met. That&rsquo;s why I continue to refer to the same individuals&hellip;If something happens in the market, they reach out to my clients. My clients are never having to call them; they&hellip;keep them in the loop.&rdquo;</p><p> Gatekeepers also build trust with a financial through a dovetailing of investment philosophy. &ldquo;I work with high net worth clients,&rdquo; one accountant observed. &ldquo;If I refer them to a financial advisor, it is based on my own investment philosophy (which is) based on asset allocation done properly so you have investments across the board&hellip;So the ones that I have worked with and I have referred to are in that long-term approach to investments.&rdquo;</p><p> To ensure that trust isn&rsquo;t broken, most accountants to whom we spoke indicated that they continue to monitor the relationship between their client and the financial advisor, although often times it is on an informal basis. &ldquo;We do check-in, typically on an annual basis when we&rsquo;re working with their tax preparation for their business assets,&rdquo; one told us. &ldquo;I will (monitor) at least in the beginning just to make sure that (the client is) happy,&rdquo; responded another. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to hear back if they&rsquo;re not happy, and then after a certain period of time, you just kind of hopefully just accept it and everybody&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo; </p>",

    "content": "<p> What a great time of the year. Cherry blossoms are out, baseball opening day is right around the corner, and the best single elimination tournament in sports is on its way.</p><h3> <strong>  That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s March Madness time. </strong></h3>For those of you unfamiliar, March Madness, as it&rsquo;s commonly called, is a 64-team college basketball single elimination tournament. There are four regions that each have 16 teams seeded 1 though 16. The winners of each region meet in the &ldquo;final four&rdquo; to determine who will emerge as the champion.Offices around the country are buzzing with brackets, upset picks and friendly wagers. In other words, it&rsquo;s chaos both on and off the court and it&rsquo;s glorious!In case you couldn&rsquo;t tell, I love sports. As a <u> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Most%20Important%20Question%20to%20Ask%20Financial%20Advisor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  financial advisor </a></u>, I am constantly looking at seemingly unrelated topics, and comparing them to the world of finance. What may come as a surprise to you is that investing and March Madness have more in common than you think.So what does the tournament have to do with investing? Let&rsquo;s have some fun and take a look.<h3> <strong>  You Can&rsquo;t Predict the Future </strong></h3>Every year people get excited about their bracket. We watch the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; on TV and eagerly listen to their reasons for picking one team over another. We all go into the season thinking that this is &ldquo;our year.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve done the research and we&rsquo;ve studied history. What could possibly go wrong?In the first round of this year&rsquo;s tournament, a record 10 double-digit seeds advanced to the second round! Do you think a lot of people predicted that? Not a chance.<a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"March Madness Brackets\" src=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-300x194.jpg\"/></a>Have you ever heard the saying on Wall Street that past performance does not guarantee future performance? There&rsquo;s a reason the saying exists. Just like last year&rsquo;s successful mutual fund managers aren&rsquo;t any more likely to pick this year&rsquo;s best accounts, the winner of last year&rsquo;s bracket pool is no more likely than you to pick this year&rsquo;s winning March Madness team.When it comes to investing, &ldquo;experts&rdquo; love to tell us what is going to happen in the future. People brag about their best stock picks and conveniently leave out their poor ones. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>  The truth is, no one knows what is coming </u> .</a> Once you accept that, you can create a financial plan that takes into account your <u> <a href=\"https://pro.riskalyze.com/embed/90260b609e67a973f2f0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  risk tolerance </a></u>, and current life situation to make the best investment decisions for you.<h3> <strong>  Diversification and Risk vs. Reward </strong></h3>No one picks a perfect bracket. The odds of filling out a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion (source: <u> <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/03/19/ncaa-tournament-perfect-bracket-odds-quintillion/1999795/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  USA Today </a></u>). According to that number, if everyone in the US filled out one bracket each year, we would see a perfect bracket once every 400 years. You&rsquo;d be better off gambling with <u> <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/powerball-ticket/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Power%20Ball\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  the lottery </a></u> based on those odds.However, straying from the standard &ldquo;favorites&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always the answer either. People love to pick the underdog or &ldquo;dark horse,&rdquo; but if you do this consistently year after year, you aren&rsquo;t likely to have much success. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t pick an underdog here or there, but the <u> <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/picking-stocks-losing-investment-strategy/?utm_source=March%20Madness&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Stock%20Picking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  risky picks </a></u> should be a subset of your overall picks, not the full strategy.The truth is, no one wins a bracket pool by picking all favorites or all upsets. As the point above taught us, everyone is just guessing. By diversifying your picks with some favorites and some upsets, you give yourself the best chance at success.The same principal applies with investing. If your portfolio is composed of stocks from one sector or all growth stocks, you are exposing yourself to huge amounts of risk. Sure, the reward may be great if you end up being right, but as we&rsquo;ve seen time and time again, that is a strategy that can set you up for disaster.",

    "content": "<h3> The great news for anybody actually reading this post is that the headline already turned a bunch of your competitors off.</h3><p> <br/> That word &ldquo;process&rdquo; is just deadly for so many advisers today that too many won&rsquo;t have bothered reading beyond the word.</p><p> It has become associated simply with compliance, or Best Practice advice.</p><p> But smart professionals they know that there is profit in good business processes.  </p><h3> Processes become the IP that underpins the real value of the firm.</h3><p> <br/> The difference between high growth advisory firms and the average ones is made up of many facets, including investment in marketing and management systems, the use of data and analytics, the investment in people in the form of quality of adviser and the ongoing development of them.  The differences also includes softer values &amp; beliefs concepts too, such as expectations and performance targets.</p><p> When it comes to expectations, high growth advisory firms aim for more, and then put resources into chasing the lofty ambitions than average industry participants.  They don&rsquo;t go for &ldquo;achievable&rdquo;.  They go for &ldquo;gee, that&rsquo;ll be a stretch&ldquo;.</p><p> Once the course for the stars has been set, it is a matter of execution and refinement of the plan.  Of course the difference between good plans which flounder, and good plans which fire up, is momentum.</p><p> High growth firms maintain momentum: they are continually progressing and moving forward, and largely because when they have found a method that produces consistent or desirable results they then capture it and turn it into &ldquo;a process&rdquo;.  It becomes &ldquo;the way we do things here&rdquo;&hellip;</p><p> Average advice firms have a tendency to adopt a more ad hoc approach: chasing what seems to be jolly good ideas at the time, with varying levels of enthusiasm, participation and execution from the team.  The principles of the firm spend their time herding cats in other words.</p><p> Instead of herding cats the high growth advisory firms create and continually refine processes.  To stretch the analogy a little further: they capture the cats and then build cat cages.  Those cat cages are built out of processes.</p><p> BUT&hellip;before anyone concludes that a cage &ndash; or a process &ndash; must be an incredibly constricting and limiting thing, take the analogy to it&rsquo;s logical conclusion:  A wildlife reserve covering millions of acres might be a &ldquo;cat cage&rdquo;.</p><p> There is scope to build processes that allow fairly high levels of autonomy and self-sufficiency within a firm within particular areas if that is what the firm desires.  Regardless of the magnitude, or latitude, of the boundaries which are established by the processes they do introduce a number of benefits to the firm that are directly linked to improved performance and profitability.</p><h3> The particular merit of processes in terms of building a highly profitable firm are that they: <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  <strong>   Create certainty and predictability in key areas within the business.  </strong>   They establish boundaries of behaviour or standards which eliminate indecision and inefficiency, and introduce greater focus on core functions and roles. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Eliminate or vastly reduce service variability.  </strong>   An ongoing weakness of service firms as a rule is the struggle to become homogenous without losing the personal touch that individual clients and advisers alike expect to be a feature of their workplace. </p></li><li> <p>  <strong>   Allow the &ldquo;wins&rdquo; to be captured and stored, creating genuine Intellectual property for the firm and its stakeholders.  </strong>   When we find a method which delivers the outcomes that we want to replicate, the &ldquo;process&rdquo; becomes our way of ensuring that knowledge is not lost, and that it can actually be successfully replicated.  This is especially valuable in sales, marketing, technology and customer care areas for a service business as they are the typical areas of greatest variability in standards and application, yet they are more closely linked to bottom line profitability than (say) best practice advice processes.  <br/>    </p></li><h3> To build a high growth firm which enjoys higher than average profitability there is no doubt that one has ton build strong and replicable processes.  </h3><p> <br/> There will be some cat-herding in getting there for sure, as someone at some point has to make sure all the wildlife is actually in the wildlife reserve.  Once they are however, the wildlife reserve can then get on with it&rsquo;s core business of protecting an ecosystem.</p><p> Similarly, once we have built our processes for running a growing and profitable practice, we can focus more effectively on our core business of helping more clients achieve better financial outcomes.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Recently, a respected colleague noted that the &ldquo;capitalistic goal of accumulation, consumption, and collecting&rdquo; is responsible for a collective mindset in Americans that &ldquo;I consume, therefore I am&rdquo; and &ldquo;more is better.&rdquo; He passionately feels the &ldquo;more is better capitalistic mentality&rdquo; assures a predictable future of dwindling resources. <strong>  He is not alone in his views. </strong></p><p> Certainly, identifying our self-worth by what we accumulate or spend does not produce emotional, physical, or financial well-being. Those who embrace a money script of &ldquo;I consume, therefore I am&rdquo; are likely to eventually encounter financial and emotional pain. Either they will run out of money to spend, lack products to buy, or discover the futility of trying to use money and possessions as a substitute for genuine self-worth.</p><h3> What I found curious was my colleague&rsquo;s attribution of the money script &ldquo;more is better&rdquo; as the product of capitalism.</h3><p> <br/> That money script has been around a lot longer than capitalism, which according to Investopedia  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/capitalism-history.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   originated during the Middle Ages  </a> </u>  when a variety of factors, including a labor shortage caused by the Black Plague, caused the collapse of the manorial system. More is better&rdquo; was part of the human condition much earlier. For example, in the Hebrew Scriptures, Ecclesiastes 5:10 says, &ldquo;Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income.&rdquo;</p><p> Greed, whether for money or food or anything else, is not produced by an economic model. Whether people live under a capitalistic, socialistic, or communist system&mdash;or in a Stone Age tribal group&mdash;greed is alive and well in all of them. Every human being experiences it in some way and on some level. It has been considered one of the seven deadly sins since the early days of the Christian church.</p><p> &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; is defined by Merriam-Webster as &ldquo;an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.&rdquo; There is nothing in that definition about greed or any goals of &ldquo;accumulation, consumption, and collecting.&rdquo;</p><p> Core to capitalism is a method of distributing limited resources in the most efficient manner possible, where the dynamics of the free market and competition drive down prices and improve quality. I find no other economic system that delivers this outcome. In fact, systems controlled by central planning have a track record of producing the opposite: economies where shortages prevail and those in charge prosper on the backs of the masses.</p><p> Research shows capitalism has  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   lifted more people out of poverty  </a> </u>  than any other economic system. Since 1945 the number of those living below the poverty line has decreased 57%, from 35% to 15%, while income inequality has risen just 15%.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;re not making connections with clients or potential clients than what&rsquo;s the point of creating content? There, I said it! And it&rsquo;s true. If you&rsquo;re in a service-based industry, your marketing should be every bit client service as it is marketing. Luckily, content marketing makes it easy to add value to your relationships and move people to take action. It&rsquo;s a win-win! </p><h3> <strong>  \"Content marketing makes it easy to add value to your relationships &amp; move people to take action.\" </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re already creating content for your audience or are just starting, you may be wondering how to capture their attention and keep it long enough to generate interest and real connections. With the supply of  <a href=\"http://www.businessesgrow.com/2014/01/06/content-shock/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content rapidly outpacing people&rsquo;s ability to consume </a>  it all, content creation can certainly feel like an impossible mountain to climb.</p><p> The good news is that you don&rsquo;t need to produce epic content every time, nor do you even need the best content that ever existed. What you do need, however, is to transfer your client service model to your marketing. That is going to be your secret way of making amazing connections with an audience through your content.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what that looks like:</p><h3> 1. You&rsquo;re going to personalize</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re using boiler-plate copy from a third party distributor, please stop. Seriously, stop! Unless you&rsquo;re taking that copy and rewriting it for your audience, it&rsquo;s not going to serve you, and more importantly &ndash; it&rsquo;s not going to serve them. Your clients have a lot of options when it comes to the content they consume. Why should they read some general, boring piece of uninspired compilation of industry terms when they can read something better?</p><p> As customers, we hate it when we call into a customer service desk and get someone reading from a script. It feels cheap and frankly insulting. When you don&rsquo;t personalize your content for your audience, that&rsquo;s how it feels for them &ndash; bad. So next time you get ready to share a piece of content, produce it with an audience of one in mind.  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/content-marketing/create-content-clients-will-love/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Create it as if you were creating it for your very best client  </u>  . </a>  Even the simplest of emails that you send to your clients embodies the type of care and personalization you should incorporate into your marketing content. That is what is going to help your potential clients feel a connection with you right away.</p><h3> 2. It&rsquo;s going to have energy</h3><p> <br/> Personalization is one thing and personality something else. People are drawn to certain types of personalities and your content can exude that energy with the types of words and manner in which you present concepts, ideas, invitations and advice. Even a blank white screen with type on it can have energy. If you are sharing an important idea, use important punctuation! If you want to persuade your audience to take action, use persuasive copy that communicates urgency and value beyond their wildest dreams. &ldquo;go here&rdquo; &ldquo;click this&rdquo; &ldquo;read more&rdquo; blah blah blah. Energy is absolutely contagious &mdash; and so is low energy. If you want to move people to action, energize them and demonstrate a force that is worth their time.</p><p> And let&rsquo;s face it, some of the topics in your industry might be inherently boring to your clients. How do you interest your clients on such topics when you&rsquo;re talking over the phone, in a meeting or via email? Bottle that energy you use to keep their attention and use it with your content.</p><h3> 3. You&rsquo;re going to educate or entertain</h3><p> <br/> There are really only two reasons why someone will spend time with your content:  <u>  <a href=\"http://lmhinzmarketing.com/content-marketing/why-you-should-be-giving-away-all-your-advice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   it is either helping them learn something  </a> </u>  or it&rsquo;s entertaining (hence why cat videos are all the rage on YouTube.) And better if your content can do both at the same time!</p><p> &lsquo;How To&rsquo; articles are wonderful to help teach your audience something. Visual content is ridiculously effective in capturing attention, engaging your audience and increasing conversion rates. Why not write a blog post and then do a little video about the information you covered!? This will help you further personalize your content and demonstrate even more energy to your audience. This quote by Walt Disney is one of my favorites and one that I keep in mind any time I produce a new piece of content for my brand or for my clients:</p><p> I would rather entertain and hope that people learned something, than educate people and hope they were entertained.&rdquo; &ndash; Walt Disney</p><p> You have to make your content worth your audience&rsquo;s time. This is the value-factor of your content &mdash; the same type of value you deliver to your clients. You let your clients know what they need to know, when they need to know it. Abide by this very same principle in your content marketing.</p><h3> 4. It&rsquo;s going to evoke an emotional response</h3><p> <br/> How does someone feel after they consume a piece of your content? Better? Worse? Scared? Excited? Relieved? Hopeful? Empowered? I can cover all the emotions of the universe and yet so much content out there doesn&rsquo;t evoke any sort of emotional response whatsoever. What a waste of your time and talents if people feel nothing after they consume your content. Nothing is the same as empty and empty is, well it&rsquo;s empty.</p><p> In marketing, we like the &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo; approach, though that doesn&rsquo;t always work in every piece of content. The idea is that your content is really effective if it makes people go, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Awww!&rdquo;  Figuratively speaking, you can get a lot of &ldquo;Oh!&rsquo;s&rdquo; when you enlighten your audience with information that helps them. When you tell a heartfelt story (which I am sure you have plenty of), you increase your chances of evoking the &ldquo;Awww&rdquo; response. Both are powerful and both are insanely effective in helping a brand make an emotional connection with their audience. </p><h3> <strong>  \"Your content is really effective if it makes people go, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Awww!&rdquo;\" </strong></h3><br/>What ways will you improve your content so that you&rsquo;re making stronger connection with your clients and ideal clients? Try implementing these four methods and measure the change in response.",

In fact, much research about the way consumers perceive &ldquo;brands&rdquo; hinges on the consistency and predictability of a company&rsquo;s offerings.</p><p> If we focus on no other aspect of the customer experience, I recommend the dedicated pursuit of consistency; particularly as it relates to:</p><p> <strong>  Product Quality </strong></p><p> <strong>  Service Speed </strong></p><p> <strong>  Staff Knowledge </strong></p><p> <strong>  Price Transparency </strong></p><p> <strong>  The Emotional Outcomes Emerging from Every Customer Interaction </strong></p><h3> Brands lose value when customers can&rsquo;t predict the quality of the products and experiences they will receive.</h3><p> <br/> Companies, I&rsquo;ve worked with and written about, like Mercedes-Benz and Starbucks develop very loyal customers (zealots, if you will) by being so predictable that customers imbed the products into the fabric and rituals of their daily lives. Many Starbucks customers have daily coffee preparation rituals at home and work as well as daily Starbucks caf&eacute; visit rituals. The brand creates order in the midst of a brand loyalist&rsquo;s hectic day and even represents the familiar when customers travel far from home.</p><p> How predictable are your products, prices, services, and emotional outcomes? Is your brand seen as a safe haven in swirling seas of competitive options?</p><p> Now more than ever, your customers need you, your products, and your people to be a source of consistency!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> You can&rsquo;t expect your entire staff to keep working for you forever. Employees leave for a variety of reasons. Maybe they want more money. Maybe they don&rsquo;t feel as though you&rsquo;re offering enough professional development opportunities. Maybe they don&rsquo;t find much meaning in their current work and are interested in something more fulfilling.</p><h3> While you can&rsquo;t prevent your employees from leaving your company, you can take proactive steps to reduce the likelihood they do. </h3><p> <br/> And you should.</p><p> In addition to knocking your team off its proverbial footing when someone leaves and you need to add new blood into the mix, employee turnover can really hurt your company&rsquo;s purse.</p><p> According to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/research/documents/retaining%20talent-%20final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SHRM  </a> </u> , direct employee replacement costs soar to as much as 60% of a worker&rsquo;s annual salary. When you factor in other variables like accrued paid time off and replacement expenses, the total cost of employee turnover can cost anywhere between 90% and 200% of an employee&rsquo;s salary.</p><h3> Two-hundred percent!</h3><p> <br/> No matter how well your company is performing, there&rsquo;s no way you should be comfortable with forking over twice a would-be employee&rsquo;s salary just to hire a new worker when someone leaves. So it goes without saying it&rsquo;s in your best interest to do everything you can to encourage employees to stick around.</p><p> But how are you supposed to know whether an employee might be thinking about severing ties with your company? If you notice any of the following changes in behavior, you may want to pull your employee aside and have a conversation to see how they&rsquo;re doing.</p><h3> <strong>  1. There&rsquo;s a noticeable change in attitude &mdash; for the worse </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s say Jim, a graphic designer, has worked for your company for two years. He&rsquo;s always in a good mood. He makes people laugh. He&rsquo;s always ready to lend a helping hand. All of a sudden, every time you see Jim, he has a scowl on his face. There&rsquo;s no more laughter. He looks angry, and he never offers to help anyone anymore.</p><p> Such a drastic change in personality may very well indicate that Jim is ready to quit at any moment.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Employees with perfect attendance start taking a lot of unplanned time off </strong></h3><p> <br/> Not every employee takes uses up all of their paid days off each year. In fact, some employees seem to be such fixtures at work that you wonder if they ever take any time off at all.</p><p> If one of your employees who has a record of perfect attendance starts calling in sick every other week, it may indicate that individual is interviewing elsewhere. Worse yet, the employee could dread coming to work so much that they can&rsquo;t get out of bed in the morning and play hooky instead.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Chatty team members keep their lips sealed during meetings </strong></h3><p> <br/> Have you recently noticed that one of your team members you used to be able to rely on for insights and ideas at group meetings has all of a sudden become mute?</p><p> When chatty employees stop talking as much, it could indicate they&rsquo;ve checked out and are on the verge of quitting once they get another gig.</p><h3> <strong>  4. The quality of an employee&rsquo;s work plummets for no reason </strong></h3><p> <br/> When employees become disengaged at work, they lose the incentive to try to reach their fullest potential. They don&rsquo;t want to be at work as it is, so they figure, what&rsquo;s the point in giving it their all? If one of your top performers has started turning in low-quality work all of a sudden, check in with that individual to see whether they are still motivated and if there&rsquo;s anything you can do to help them succeed.</p><p> Remember, a drop in performance might not always indicate someone wants to leave; they could just be dealing with some personal demons or struggles at home. The only way you&rsquo;ll know for sure is by asking.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Productive workers start doing the bare minimum </strong></h3><p> <br/> Every worker has quotas of some sort. For some, quotas turn into a game; they want to see how much more they can produce.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve noticed one of your workers who consistently over-delivers has all of a sudden reverted to producing the bare minimum, there&rsquo;s a good chance that employee is thinking about hopping jobs the first moment they can.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Workers start coming in late and leaving early </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your office likely has some sort of set business hours &mdash; or at least &ldquo;normal&rdquo; business hours where most team members are in the office.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you start noticing that Suzie, a member of the sales team, has developed the awesome habit of coming in an hour or more late and leaving way before anyone else does. When Suzie started, you routinely saw that she was always on time and one of the last people to leave at night.</p><p> When someone isn&rsquo;t even willing to pretend to put in the requisite hours each week, they&rsquo;re probably thinking about working somewhere else.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Employees say they have a doctor&rsquo;s appointment and show up to work in a tie </strong></h3><p> <br/> Have you recently noticed that one of your more scraggly-dressed employees is starting to show up to work in nicer clothes on a somewhat scattered basis?</p><p> You don&rsquo;t need to wear a suit to go to the doctor. When employees are randomly dressed nicely for work, that &ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s appointment&rdquo; may actually be a job interview.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Huge life changes are on the horizon </strong></h3><p> <br/> Employees don&rsquo;t only quit jobs for negative reasons. Sometimes, major life changes can determine whether an employee sticks around or not. For example, let&rsquo;s say one of your employee&rsquo;s wives landed an incredible job across the country. The opportunity is too good to pass up, so your employee is out the door.</p><p> Or one of your employees could become pregnant. Who&rsquo;s to say whether she will return to work after giving birth? On the flip side, one of your male employees might become a stay-at-home dad after his wife gives birth.</p><p> Understanding what cues to look for can help you determine whether an employee might be on the verge of quitting. Instead of waiting for that to happen, take a proactive approach and reach out to unhappy team members to see if there&rsquo;s anything you can do to make them enjoy work more. Employee retention will not only save your company big bucks, but it'll also save your workforce's morale.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What is most frequently left out of an advisor&rsquo;s succession plan is the client? </h3><p> <br/> Not the assets, but the behavioral side of the client.  After all, 93.7% of the financial planning process is the behavioral management of the client, so why wouldn&rsquo;t this information be a valuable part of your business and your plan?</p><p> When the advisor is close to retirement, the client really has three questions:</p><li> <strong>  Will my portfolio be similarly managed and allow me to reach my goals? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will the relationship with my new advisor be an enjoyable one? </strong></li><li> <strong>  Will I receive the same service? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> You will notice that the majority of the client&rsquo;s concerns deal with personality and behavior.</p><p> Now let&rsquo;s move to the new advisor.  They want to be sure to retain as many clients as possible. According to a Price Metrix Study, advisors retaining 95% of clients 2010-2013 grew AUM 25%; those retaining 80% of clients, grew AUM just 12%.</p><p> What was a &ldquo;good fit&rdquo; for the retiring advisor may not be a good fit for the new advisor.  While you don&rsquo;t have to prospect to acquire this &ldquo;transitioned&rdquo; client, it can feel like you are starting over since you are just beginning the relationship.</p><p> There is a certain amount of trust that is transferred over from the retiring advisor but the new advisor will have to build it based on their unique personality.</p><p> Imagine being able to turn over your clients with the behavioral big data on how to sell, service and create a unique experience.  The first appointment with the new advisor would be so much easier and the client would feel understood. </p><h3> Trust would be built at a much faster rate.  And trust is the key to retention.</h3><p> <br/> Start building a behaviorally smart succession plan to ensure your clients will stay with a firm that you worked so hard to build!</p>",

Larger &ldquo;super OSJs&rdquo; offer more, including access to scale pricing, enhanced service and extras such as an in-house CIO. Advisors pay an override on their business in order to affiliate. Those that choose an OSJ value the enhanced resources, support and service more than the additional cost.</p><h3> <strong>  Service provider:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Service providers play a critical role for a breakaway advisor in building an independent RIA, managing the transition and providing the advisor access to a best-in-class platform and technology suite. Whether it is bidding out loans to multiple banks, shopping for top fixed income returns, accessing multiple alternatives platforms or tapping into research, advisors who align with a service provider are part of a community and have access to enhanced resources, pricing and ongoing support for back office and compliance functions. Service providers do not pay transition deals and advisors that choose this model believe that the support and resources justify the cost. Examples of top service providers are Dynasty Financial Partners, HighTower Network and Concert.</p><h3> <strong>  Strategic and Capital Partners:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investors in top RIA firms typically purchase up to 40-50% of a firm&rsquo;s EBITDA. In return, the seller receives cash and equity consideration. Much like the service provider model, the investor typically manages the breakaway/transition process, builds the RIA and provides access to a state of the art platform, technology and scale pricing. Advisors who choose this partnership model value becoming part of a community with other top RIAs, monetizing a piece of the business and leveraging the investor&rsquo;s capital and deal expertise to drive inorganic growth. Since this model involves selling equity it does not work for advisors who want to retain full control over the business. Focus Financial Partners is the largest investor in the independent space.</p><h3> <strong>  Join an independent RIA:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Well established RIAs that have created a scalable infrastructure are looking to recruit and can offer a breakaway advisor the benefits of independence, including a higher payout and open architecture in a fully supported, plug and play environment. Smaller standalone RIAs may merge their business into a large enterprise-level RIA in order to offload minutia, and gain scale, resources and bench strength, as well as to solve for succession. The potential negatives are that the advisor becomes an employee of the firm, cannot self-brand and gives up a degree of control.</p><h3> <strong>  Quasi-independent:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> These models provide an advisor an open architecture, multi-custodial platform with no proprietary product manufacturing, delivered in a full-service branch environment. In this model an advisor gives up the ability to self-brand and accepts an employee payout in return for a transition deal that is typically cash plus equity in the overall partnership. Some of the top quasi-independent models are HighTower Partnership, Steward Partners, William Blair and Snowden Lane.</p><p> <strong>  At the end of the day, although the leap from an employee model to the independent space can be overwhelming </strong> , don&rsquo;t let &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo; kick in. By defining your vision and specific needs first, you can determine which model is right for you and then rely on your new partner to help you over the finish line to independence.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> There can be a potential performance advantage to tilting a core equity portfolio to smaller cap and value stocks, as was demonstrated by the work of Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French in the early 1990s.</h3><p> <br/> A market-weighted index is a common means of capturing total equity market exposure. Many investors believe that owning companies in proportion to their size in the market &ndash; as determined by the number of shares available to the public and the market price of the stock &ndash; creates the &ldquo;optimal stock portfolio.&rdquo; 1</p>But academic research and empirical evidence suggest that market weighting builds in a bias toward speculative growth and larger companies. Growth companies typically trade at higher multiples to their earnings or book value.2 The price for the firm&rsquo;s stock is higher and so, in turn, is its market capitalization.<p> The investor who seeks total equity market exposure via a market-weighted index may pay more for each dollar of earnings or equity for growth companies. At the same time, he or she may not be fully compensated for the risks being taken by under-exposure to small cap and value stocks.</p><h3> <strong>  TILTING TOWARD SMALLER CAPS AND VALUE </strong></h3><p> <br/> There can be a potential performance advantage to tilting a core equity portfolio to smaller cap and value stocks, as was demonstrated by the work of Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French in the early 1990s. Prior to Fama and French&rsquo;s work, the general belief was that the expected future performance of a stock was tied directly to the volatility of the stock&rsquo;s price versus that of the market. In other words, a stock whose price was more volatile (i.e., riskier) than the market &ndash; or had a beta greater than 1 &ndash; should earn more than the market return, to compensate the investor for taking on the additional risk.</p><p> But Fama and French found that beta did not fully explain the returns of a stock over time. Their research showed that two other factors played key roles in determining the expected future return of a company&rsquo;s stock: the size of the company and its valuation. They found that the smaller a company&rsquo;s market capitalization and the higher the ratio of the firm&rsquo;s book value to its market value, the greater was its expected return. They also found that the return premiums provided by size and value factors were persistent over long periods of time.</p><h3> Fama and French found that 90&ndash;95% of manager outperformance above beta was directly related to the size and value risk premiums.   <p>  Why are size and value premiums available? There are two competing theories. </p> <p>  Those who believe that the market is efficient and that securities are always priced correctly think that any outperformance is likely due to the increased risk associated with smaller-capitalized companies and value firms. </p> <li>  <strong>   Size risk premium:   </strong>  Firms that are less established (smaller) need to compensate investors by offering them greater returns for taking on excess risk (independent of price volatility). </li> <li>  <strong>   Value risk premium:   </strong>  Firms in mature industries (value) need to compensate investors by offering them greater returns for taking on excess risk (independent of price volatility).  <br/>    </li> <p>  Those who believe that markets are inefficient think any outperformance is likely a function of the mispricing of these companies. </p> <li>  <strong>   Size premium:  </strong>   Smaller companies are perceived as not providing investors with sufficient information (quality and quantity) to be accurately valued. </li> <li>  <strong>   Value premium:  </strong>   What these companies are worth can often be underestimated because they are deemed to offer limited growth prospects.  <br/>    </li> <h3>  <strong>   The Reality Behind Manager Skill  </strong> </h3> <p>  <br/>  By applying regression analysis to historical returns, Fama and French found that 90&ndash;95% of manager performance was directly related to exposure to three factors: sensitivity to market volatility (market beta), exposure to the size risk premium and exposure to the value risk premium. The remainder was attributed to the manager&rsquo;s skill in selecting stocks, known as alpha. Previously, under the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) one-factor model, active manager performance was viewed as coming from just two sources: the market beta of the portfolio (responsible for approximately 70% of expected returns) and alpha. Fama and French determined that many managers had &ldquo;outperformed&rdquo; their CAPM beta by adding exposure in their portfolios to small caps and value stocks. </p> <h3>  <strong>   MORNINGSTAR U.S. MARKET FACTOR TILT INDEX  </strong>  <p>   <br/>   <strong>    Size   </strong>  </p>  <p>   In order to effectively capture a more substantial size premium from the market, an index needs to delve deeper into the investable universe than traditional broad market indexes. The Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index holds 99.5% of the investable U.S. equity universe. By going deeper than other market indexes, the Morningstar Index seeks to capture more of the size premium while still avoiding the very bottom of the market that may have illiquidity issues.  </p>  <p>   <strong>    Value   </strong>  </p>  <p>   The Morningstar Index also uses its proprietary value orientation score to classify securities that are undervalued and overvalued. This value orientation score is part of Morningstar&rsquo;s style box framework for individual stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. The Morningstar approach incorporates both forward-looking and historical factors into its classification methodology. The use of multiple value factors mitigates the risk of a stock being misclassified due to a company&rsquo;s management decisions about financing options, cash flow usage, dividend policy or financial reporting.  </p>  <p>   Learn more about Flexshares    <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-rethinking-total-equity-post-32816\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    <u>     here    </u>   </a>   .   <br/>      </p> </h3></h3>1 This is a key component of Harry Markowitz&rsquo;s research on Modern Portfolio Theory.<br/>2 Book value is the sum of capital surplus, common stock and retained earnings.<br/>3 Alpha is a fund&rsquo;s excess return relative to its benchmark.",

    "content": "<h3> Without a good drip email process you are letting a lot of business slip through your fingers. <br/>  </h3><p> While a phone call, face-to-face opportunity, seminar and even conference call helps you initiate a new relationship, an effective drip email process helps to maintain and elevate that relationship with just the click of your key board.</p><p> The challenge is with so many emails filling an inbox you must make your drip email something people want to open and I will tell you right now a standard market update doesn&rsquo;t cut it.</p><p> So I wanted to give you a taste of five different ways you can use drip emails to get more attention and generate more interest.</p><h3> 1. Make it personal <br/>  </h3><p> Always share a little something about you or an experience you encountered to make the attached article more relevant.</p><p> Dear client,</p><p> You know I&rsquo;ve been hearing and reading about this recession but when I want to the mall with my family this past weekend we couldn&rsquo;t even find a parking spot! I thought if everyone is struggling then why is the mall full of shoppers???</p><p> This article really helped clarify this new phenomenon and thought it would clear things up for you too&hellip;.</p><h3> 2.  Add Value <br/>  </h3><p> Providing a quick and easy checklist that can help your clients, prospects, friends and family identify whether they have taken the necessary steps to address a financial issue not only engages them in the email but also inspires potential opportunities.</p><p> Dear (name)</p><p> I&rsquo;m often asked &ldquo;What are the 5 most important steps to achieving financial security?&rdquo;  So I decided to share it with all of you. While these aren&rsquo;t the only things you can and should do they are certainly the first steps and should become the foundation to a successful financial plan.</p><p> Make sure you can check off everything on this list:</p><p> List 5 key items for example:</p><li> Reduce your debt to __% of your total net worth</li><li> Increase your 401 K contributions to &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</li><li> Have a 3, 5 and 10 year plan&hellip;&hellip; <br/>  </li><h3> 3.  Provide a quiz <br/>  </h3><p>  Provide a short quiz which allows the recipient to evaluate their acumen or determine their level of progress in a certain aspect of wealth management.  This quiz approach can often encourage the recipient to recognize their gaps or deficiencies within that particular area.  This new awareness can potentially motivate them to call your office and schedule an appointment.</p><p> For example:</p><p> How investment savvy are you?</p><p> Quiz</p><p> Rate your answers on a scale of 1 &ndash; 5 and total your scores at the end. </p><li> I know exactly how much money I need when I retire to maintain my current lifestyle    ____</li><li> I have a plan for retirement and am completely on track to achieve my goals                   ____</li><li> If I should pass away I am confident my spouse will be ready to manage the finances      ____</li><p> I think you get the point.  You can also make if fun by adding some humor to the answer key or incorporate a bit of your own personality into both the questions and the answer key.</p><h3> 4.  Make it a real story <br/>  </h3><p> Use situations that you have experienced working with clients (changing the names and some details of course) these real life stories not only clarify the kinds of clients that are referred to you but they identify what you are actually able to do for these clients:</p><p> I wanted to share a true story that reinforces why I love what I do.  I was recently referred a new client, she was a woman in her 60s who recently lost her husband. She came to me emotionally distraught and fearful about her financial affairs.  She didn&rsquo;t know who to turn to nor who she could trust.  After many hours of meeting with her, guiding her and helping her understand her financial picture today she is busy rebuilding her life, with less worry and concern over her daily financial issues. In fact just yesterday she came into the office to share her pictures from her recent vacation, a cruise to Alaska that she has always wanted to experience. </p><p> It&rsquo;s moments like these that remind me why I do what I do.</p><h3> 5.  Ask for feedback <br/>  </h3><p> When providing an interesting article in your email, highlight a paragraph or section of the article that really resonated with you.  Direct the recipient to this portion of the article and ask for their thoughts and feedback.</p><p> Dear _______</p><p> I found the attached article very informative especially considering what is happening overseas in Greece. The author was able to make a complicated issue more understandable. I particularly liked the section on page 3 paragraph 4, it was quite thought provoking. I would love to hear your thoughts on this issue as well&hellip;&hellip;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/nicole-leong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nicole Leong  </a> </u></p><p> Let me ask you&hellip; Are you boring your audience? Sorry to break it to you but chances are, yes you are. </p><p> Creating good content in financial services is not about what you want to say, or what you think you are great at saying. Because, newsflash: no one cares.</p><p> <img alt=\"engagin2.png\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/engagin2.png?t=1458798345337&amp;width=539&amp;height=319\"/> Content Marketing in Australia 2016: Benchmarks, Budgets, and Trends, Content Marketing Institute/ADMA</p><p> If you want to create content that is interesting and engaging, and actually effective, what you say has to be what your audience wants to hear. In other words, the content you put out has to fulfil your audience&rsquo;s unmet information needs. Hint: helpful content is rarely boring. Sounds like common sense, but it&rsquo;s surprising how few in the financial services industry seem to understand this.</p><p> Trust us, as marketers we understand the tendency to want to broadcast key messages about your company and how awesome it is, but that doesn&rsquo;t deliver any real value to your audience. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t help you to be found when your audience is sourcing information in early research stages.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quick guide on how to write content that people want to read.</p><p> First, understand your audience and what their unmet information needs are. How can you add value and help fulfil those information needs? Most organisations understand this broadly and can map out larger subsets of information that may provide useful content.</p><p> Based on your understanding of audience needs, you can also decide the the type or format of content you need to create. Consider the format that best suits the kind of information you are going to relay. Consider also the kinds of channels you know your audience uses. For exploration of more complex issues, for example, a whitepaper may work well.  For more practical \"doing\" information or guidance, a checklist is both valuable and very shareable. Consider also whether you make it a broader, more general &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; or a brand/product-specific piece espousing the practical benefits you have to offer. Make your content purposeful by mapping it to your buyer&rsquo;s journey.</p><h3> Let the data guide you <br/>  </h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve got format and broad topic areas sorted, it&rsquo;s time to use research and data to narrow and finesse the topic and decide on the angle that best suits your audience (and on which your company is, of course, an expert). Zeroing in on specifics, providing tangible examples and offering actionable insights is where you can really hit the interest button. This is a far cry from broad generic content that leaves your audience thinking \"so what\" instead of \"gee whiz\". </p><p> Validate and refine your topic by doing some quick keyword research using  <u>  <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com.au/KeywordPlanner\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google&rsquo;s free keyword planner tool  </a> </u>  that shows exactly what topics people are searching for and how.  <u>  <a href=\"//www.google.com.au/trends\">   Google Trends  </a> </u>  shows how search volumes for a certain keyword have changed over a specified period of time, helping you identify trending topics.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s work through a financial services content creation example&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Anticipation of the July 1 regulatory reforms for advisers and for providers of life insurance has grown steadily in past months, and recent events have put the life insurance and financial advice sectors in the spotlight, feeding both external pressures and internal uncertainty.</p><p> An opportunity here is for insurance companies to reach and connect with their intermediary audiences by addressing their pain points. For example, the term &ldquo;AFSL compliance&rdquo; gets an average of 170 monthly searches, presumably nearly entirely from intermediaries. A helpful piece of content could provide information on how advisers can make sure they&rsquo;re compliant, or provide insight into how the removal of the accountants&rsquo; exemption may affect them.</p><p> Also make use of your own analytics &ndash; examine the volume and quality of traffic your existing content offers. Did certain topics receive more engagement than others? Which pieces brought in quality leads? Take a cue from your own history to gain clarity on what your audience likes.</p><h3> Skyscraper existing content <br/>  </h3><p> Tools like  <u>  <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buzzsumo  </a> </u>  pick up content from all over the web that&rsquo;s doing well in terms of social shares. You can even search particular domains, such as your competitors&rsquo;. Sneaky, huh?</p><p> The idea is then to take one of those content topics as inspiration and build on it, making it your own. Add your own expert insights, update it so it&rsquo;s current, or modify it so that it&rsquo;s particularly relevant to your niche audience. Why start from scratch when you can take what others have done and make it better?</p><p> With the current market volatility, many of us are looking to the 2016 federal budget, to be brought down on 3 May, for guidance. A search on Buzzsumo brings up popular articles about the budget, which in turn show common uncertainties and doubts. An insurance provider could look through these for instant inspiration on angles that would get good audience traction.</p><p> <img alt=\"buzzsumo.png\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/buzzsumo.png?t=1458798345337&amp;width=739&amp;height=516\"/></p><h3> Listen in on the buzz <br/>  </h3><p> We all know social media&rsquo;s a great way to get your ear to the ground and hear what people are saying about your brand, but have you thought of also using it for content creation?</p><p> Twitter&rsquo;s unique opinion-heavy &ldquo;micro-blogging&rdquo; style particularly suits this purpose. Just by doing a search we can see quickly and clearly what people are pleased, upset, or unsure about, which is handy for content inspiration.</p><p> <img alt=\"twitter_budget-748273-edited.png\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/537730/hubfs/twitter_budget-748273-edited.png?t=1458798345337&amp;width=500\"/></p><p> Forums like Quora and Whirlpool are another place for consumer companies to pick up on chatter &ndash; look out for popular topics or questions that come up repeatedly.</p><h3> Talk to your customers <br/>  </h3><p> Finally, you can tap into your target audience&rsquo;s mind by talking to people with whom you already connected. Think about your favourite clients &ndash; the ones who are easy to deal with, and most importantly, profitable. Ultimately, your aim is to attract more people like them. Take note of the questions they ask during your interactions with them, or uncertainties they might have. If you don&rsquo;t interact directly with clients often, speaking with frontline salespeople or account managers might clue you in.</p><p> There&rsquo;s no need to sit in an inspiration vacuum trying to plan your editorial calendar - a wealth of resources exists for you to draw on to create content your audiences will actually want to read.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Ideally, the road to a secure retirement starts the day you and your spouse exchange wedding vows. <br/>  </h3><p> However, for most people, retirement is not at the top of the list when they embark on married life. With sound financial planning and good communication, you can look forward to  your Golden Years together, secure in the knowledge that you taken appropriate steps to make your marriage ready for retirement.</p><h3> Retirement: A Major Financial and Lifestyle Change <br/>  </h3><p> If you were to ask several people at random to describe what retirement means to them, you would get different answers from each one. The &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; picture of spending one&rsquo;s retirement puttering around the house and working on hobbies is no longer the norm for today&rsquo;s active seniors. People are living longer, healthier lives. Many people want, and expect, retirement to be a kind of &ldquo;second act&rdquo; where they will get to do things they didn&rsquo;t have the time or money to do when they were younger.</p><p> For some people, that may mean stopping work entirely and moving from an employee collecting a salary to drawing an income from their investments. Other people, either from choice or necessity, continue working past the standard retirement age of 65. They may choose to start receiving their Canada Pension Plan benefits at age 60. If they choose this option, it will mean receiving a lower monthly benefit than if they had waited until age 65 to start receiving payments.</p><p> Starting a business is an option for some retirees. They want to stay active and have the time to devote to getting a new venture off the ground. For others in this age group, staying active involves volunteering their time for an organization that can benefit from their knowledge and experience.</p><h3> It Pays to Have a Plan for Retirement <br/>  </h3><p> For many couples, retirement is a vague concept. During the years when they are focused on paying down a mortgage and raising a family, contributing to their RRSP may not be their top priority. Unless a couple has a clear idea of what they want their retirement to look like, they run the risk of getting to the point where one or both spouses will be about to leave the workforce and they will be looking at each other thinking, &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</p><p> To avoid that unfortunate circumstance, a couple should talk about their hopes and dreams for retirement. This is the starting point to making them a reality. Sitting down with a financial advisor early on can help to clarify the steps necessary to break them down into goals.</p><p> Over time, the goals for retirement may change. A good financial plan should have some flexibility in it to account for unexpected circumstances that may come up along the way.</p><h3> Start to Get your Marriage Ready for Retirement Now <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s never too early in your marriage to start talking about the retirement that you both want. A good way to discuss your goals is by asking some open-ended questions. Here are a few to help you get started:</p><li> At what age would you ideally like to retire?</li><li> How do you see yourself spending a typical day in retirement?</li><li> Would you like to live in the same city or would you consider relocating?</li><li> If you are interested in moving, how much would it cost to live somewhere else?</li><li> Is downsizing to a smaller house or an apartment part of your plan?</li>",

    "title": "Financial Spring Cleaning: 5 Tips for Financial Growth and Prosperity",
    "link": "financial-spring-cleaning-5-tips-for-financial-growth-and-prosperity",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> As the calendar rushes headlong into spring, it&rsquo;s time to start emerging from the winter doldrums and breath some fresh air into your financial life. There&rsquo;s no heavy lifting, mounds of dust to brush away or boxes to lug to the trash. <br/>  </h3><p> But you will need a pair of fresh eyes, a willing attitude and the participation of those who will feel the impact of your financial decisions.</p><p> Your essential goal is to make sure your values are aligned with your actions. So if you really care about something&mdash;like protecting your family, saving for retirement, leading a balanced life or simply living within your means&mdash;than a new look can be just the thing to inject some energy into your financial life. </p><h3> <strong>  Here are five tips to get you started: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Cash flow <br/>  </h3><p> What is your weekly, monthly or quarterly savings target? Are you hitting it? If so, terrific! If not, what can you eliminate, alter or shave to help you pack away more cash to fund that which you value most? Look at your spending with a critical eye. Are you getting full value for the dollars you spend? Every dollar that you rescue from spending can be shifted toward your highest values.</p><p> Remember to pay yourself first. If you have a 15% savings target, than you must direct 15% of every deposit toward that goal (saving or investment). Paying yourself first puts your important goals above your spending decisions.</p><h3> 2. Retirement plans <br/>  </h3><p> Some 401(k) plans offer automatic rebalancing. Elect this option if it&rsquo;s available so as not to allow market volatility to tilt your portfolio away from a rational allocation. If you don&rsquo;t have this option, then you might have to work your way through the website to manually adjust your holdings back to your model. If you have not maximized your contributions, than make sure you are edging your contribution levels upward as often as possible. Remember, even a 1% increase should pay you back handsomely in the future.</p><h3> 3. Assessing your risk management <br/>  </h3><p> We&rsquo;re talking about emergency funds, insurance of all kinds and legal protection. Do you have any old life insurance policies that you&rsquo;ve been paying on forever or policies that were given to you by your parents? Do you still need the coverage? Does it still make sense based on your needs? Look at the range of protection you have from medical to liability; from disability to renters or homeowners. Do you have a deductible or co-insurance that makes sense based on your current economics? If you bought your policies when you first started out, you may have signed up for low deductibles because cash was so tight. But as your financial stability grows, those low deductibles are no longer appropriate. The premium savings can be shifted to areas you value more.</p><h3> 4. Investment strategies <br/>  </h3><p> Sometimes, buying an investment can be the result of an emotional decision. This is a perfect time to review your holdings to assess whether those decisions are currently in your best interest and how they fit into your overall game plan. If you&rsquo;re a stock picker, make sure you have a very disciplined and well-conceived plan for when to sell a stock. If you find you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with a stock (the word Apple makes a lot of knees go weak), consider whether your belief is cast in anything beyond loving their product. History is littered with great companies that no longer exist. Consider your strategy, time horizon and how much risk you&rsquo;re willing to take to achieve your goals.</p><h3> 5. Estate planning and documents <br/>  </h3><p> Do you have a Will, Power of Attorney and Health Care Directive? If so, congratulations! Are these documents still relevant and current or do they need a cleanup because of changes in your life or the law? If you do not have Estate documents, than the only thing you need to clean up is to get them done. You&rsquo;re not alone if you&rsquo;ve put this off. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a sexy thing to spend your money on. But the fact is, if you have children and no Will, dying means that your State will decide what happens with your children and your estate&mdash;and that&rsquo;s rarely a good thing.</p><p> Spring is a time of regeneration and growth. Why not do a little financial spring cleaning now to usher in a season of the right financial growth and prosperity?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> There's no reason for you to worry if your business has critics because it could mean that you are doing something right. <br/>  </h3><p> As a matter of fact, experts believe that businesses that only have fans and zero critics are not necessarily successful businesses. If you have few or no critics at all, this could mean that you're in the wrong niche, or that your marketing strategies are not good enough for your company to stand out.</p><p> Both positive and negative feedback from customers can play a very important role in maintaining and expanding a successful business. Although it isn't fun hearing complaints coming from your customers, it can be an important learning experience for you, whether you like it or not.</p><h3> Here are the steps for handling your haters and critics: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Don't easily get offended by what you hear <br/>  </h3><p> Criticisms often come in terrible wrapping, and there's little you can do to make them sound better. What you can do, instead, is to take the tone for granted and just pay attention to the content. Especially if the criticism is from not just a single customer, you must look deeper and look past how it is said.</p><h3> 2. Determine what you can learn from the negative feedback from the customer <br/>  </h3><p> Every criticism or bad comment from a hater comes with a lesson you should learn as a business owner. You should realize that customer complaints won't exist if everything is done right. Again, you need to focus on what message the angry customer or customers are trying to say to you. Use this to identify which parts of your services or products need to be improved.</p><h3> 3. Focus on how you will respond to the content <br/>  </h3><p> Whether your critic is attacking you online or in person, keep in mind that your customers are likely to evaluate you based on how you react or respond to them. Therefore, it's important that you keep your tone polite and professional regardless of the harsh words being used by your angry customers.</p><h3> 4. Find a solution...quick <br/>  </h3><p> It's not enough that you respond to criticisms politely and in a timely manner. More importantly, you need to offer a quick solution to your customers' concerns. Keep in mind that the main reason your customers are reaching out to you is not to vent out or express dismay. What they want is for you to help them resolve the issues they are dealing with. This has to be your top priority.</p><p> The bottom-line is that criticisms can in fact be one of the most powerful driving forces to improve your business. Also, the way you respond to your critics will significantly improve your reputation. A good business consultant is one who can equip you with systems and skills that will help you do better in dealing with your haters and critics.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Most consumers today don&rsquo;t trust marketing ploys and do not take a brand&rsquo;s word at face value. People are tuning out advertisements at an unprecedented rate, leaving marketers to find new avenues to build awareness around products, services, and companies. <br/>  </h3><p> Nowadays, when individuals find themselves interested in making a purchase, they take to the web and research extensively to find the best option available.</p><p> This is partially why content marketing has become such an effective modality; because content provides value and has the ability to convert a consumer into a customer.</p><p> Anyone who has spent a bit of time in business or marketing understands that it is far more cost effective to retain customers than acquire new ones. But there is a way to have the best of both worlds; it involves leveraging your current customers into helping recruit new ones. Enter: Advocate marketing. </p><h3> What is Advocate Marketing? <br/>  </h3><p> Advocate marketing is relatively new to the industry yet possesses massive potential to elevate a business&rsquo;s bottom line. Consumers trust the opinions of peers far more than that of brands. Advocate marketing takes individuals who have first-hand experience with a company they believe in and transform them into a brand advocate who will spread the good word to the masses.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://influitive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Influitive  </a> </u> , a software company that is leading the charge in mobilizing brand advocates for businesses, describes these folks best by stating:</p><p> &ldquo;Advocates are not just satisfied customers. They are enthusiasts who embrace your company&rsquo;s vision and willingly advance your interests through their interaction with others. Whether by sharing experiences online, referring new business, or recommending your products, these supporters have enormous influence on your brand, demand generation, and pipeline efforts.&rdquo;</p><p> How exactly will advocate marketing improve a business and launch it to new heights?</p><h3> The Case for Advocate Marketing <br/>  </h3><p> Peer opinions are far more valuable to consumers than virtually any form of advertising, promotion, or marketing message. The folks at Mintel recently conducted a study which revealed that nearly 70% of Americans seek out advice before making a purchase. Additionally, 72% of those individuals, ages 25 &ndash; 34, turn to their social media contacts for recommendations. And the average satisfied customer typically influences 42 friends on social.</p><p> This is, in part, why influencer marketing is so powerful. Followers view these individuals more as friends and trusted resources than anything else. But word-of-mouth is clearly still one of the most effective forms of advertising; the exact reason why creating brand advocates is such a dynamic and influential way of marketing.</p><p> Since advocates believe so strongly in a brand&rsquo;s vision, they are more than willing to oblige if asked to write reviews, share their special and inspiring stories through social, and even create blog posts and various other types of content preaching the gospel of your company.</p><p> When an individual is converted to an advocate, you gain an asset in a person whose sentiment is seen as the most authentic and credible source available.</p><p> And it might be worth mentioning that Influitive&rsquo;s AdvocateHub program helped Docusign influence over $3 million in sales. On that note&hellip;</p><h3> How Advocates Drive Sales <br/>  </h3><p> Advocate marketing not only can acquire new business through reviews, content, and word-of-mouth promotions, it can send peer-to-peer- recommendations through the roof.</p><p> Advocates who are engaged are often more than happy to refer friends, family, business associates, and others to your company. These folks can also be utilized to speak with potential prospects and move the needle to sway their decision to purchase. Advocates can generate referrals for a brand through a variety of means; contests, referral challenges, incentives, and related calls to action work like a charm with people who believe in your brand.</p><p> Having just a handful of advocates won&rsquo;t cut it. Sure these people can be tapped for references, testimonials, white papers, case studies, and so forth, but they will eventually run dry. By employing a full-fledged advocate program, increased numbers of supporters can be identified and mobilized to ramp up operations and cited for these types of materials without burning out.</p><p> Additionally, having a large pool to draw from allows prospects to be matched up with industry relevant advocates which ultimately increases your chances of gaining a new customer.</p><h3> More Compelling Campaigns <br/>  </h3><p> While advocate marketing is a highly effective means to gaining new prospects and customers, it should not be viewed as a replacement to more traditional digital marketing efforts, but rather as an enhancer.</p><p> Advocates can add loads of value to marketing campaigns in a plethora of ways. For instance, the message and materials generated can be split tested through asking for advocate feedback on the elements that resonate most. Advocates can even be featured within the campaign to share their successful results with your target audience. Once a campaign is in effect, these people can help heighten social conversations, content shares, answer questions for those engaging with the campaign, and so much more. Integrating advocates into marketing campaigns adds a deep level of authenticity that cannot be duplicated by other means.</p><p> Today, more businesses than ever outsourcing their social media efforts and marketing mediums to agencies; this creates a huge divide between brands and advocates. Consumers want authenticity and to interact with trustworthy companies more than anything else.</p><p> By employing brand advocates, that divide is minimized as peers act on behalf of the business to supply individuals with sound advice on the decision that lies before them. There is no marketing message more powerful than the one your company&rsquo;s advocates can create for you.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> In a perfect world, your sales team would always sell from a place of passion, purpose, and unending motivation. <br/>  </h3><p> In the real world? Sales teams lose their focus, forget their purpose, and feel discouraged. The result: a sales dip.</p><p> What if there was a way to empower your sales team to communicate from a place of passion and excitement even after a streak of hearing no? What if they could communicate powerfully to clients about your product or service and hear yesmore often?</p><p> We learned five proven tactics for making that vision a reality in our recent interview with Josh Keck, COO of Ran Services. Josh uses these tactics every day with his sales team, and we&rsquo;re confident they will work for yours as well.</p><h3> 1) Start With the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Simon Sinek, founder of Start with Why, defines the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; as the purpose, cause, or belief that inspires you to do what you do. It&rsquo;s the internal fire keeping your sales team going even when they face rejection.</p><p> Understanding the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; behind the product or service your team is charged with selling does something no amount of training could: it keeps your team motivated.</p><p> Start with the &ldquo;Why.&rdquo; Why are you selling this product or service? Why do people need it? Why should your sales team care?</p><p> In our interview, Josh said that when you communicate and sell from your &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; it creates a feeling of genuineness and passion to your customers and gives you credibility. It&rsquo;s a powerful way to communicate.</p><h3> 2) Know the Motivators <br/>  </h3><p> There are only two main motivators in our lives: pain and pleasure.</p><p> We will do quite a bit to experience more pleasure in our lives, but the avoidance of pain is the most powerful motivator. We will do anything to avoid pain.</p><p> Understanding these motivators will help you communicate the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; to your sales team, so they can communicate the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; to their customers.</p><p> <img alt=\"5 Tactics to Help Your Team Sell From the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tactics-to-Help-Your-Team-Sell-From-the-%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D-Sweet-Fish-Media-2-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> <strong>  Ask yourself these questions: </strong></p><li> What pain can you help people avoid if they use your product or service?</li><li> What costs, risks, and potential loss does your product or service address?</li><li> What gain will people enjoy by using your product?</li><p> Remembering the answers to these questions will help fuel the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; behind &ldquo;hitting the streets&rdquo; every day to sell your product or service, and it will teach your team a powerful lesson.</p><p> When your sales team understands how your product or service helps people avoid pain, selling becomes less of a way to just make money and more of a service.</p><p> Your customers will feel the difference between the two.</p><h3> 3) Talk About the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; Every Day <br/>  </h3><p> Selling from the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight, nor will communicating the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; to your team in a single meeting do the trick.</p><p> Think about it. There is a lot on your sales team&rsquo;s plate. Between meeting with customers, explaining features, filing reports, following up with leads, traveling, and all their other duties, it&rsquo;s easy for your team to get caught up in the daily grind.</p><p> Every day, they need to be reminded of the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; behind the product or service they are selling.</p><p> <img alt=\"5 Tactics to Help Your Team Sell From the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tactics-to-Help-Your-Team-Sell-From-the-%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D-Sweet-Fish-Media-3-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> <strong>  Here are some great ways to communicate the why regularly: </strong></p><li> Start every meeting with a success story (see the next point below!)</li><li> Ask your team who they helped today (not who they sold to)</li><li> Include the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; in your emails, memos, and trainings</li><p> Keep the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; in front of your team every day so they not only remember, but begin to live and breathe that &ldquo;Why&rdquo; themselves.</p><h3> 4) Use Stories <br/>  </h3><p> Telling stories is a powerful way to communicate the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; behind your product or service.</p><p> Data, statistics, and charts might show trends and communicate the details of your product to engage your logical senses, but it&rsquo;s through stories that you engage the heart.</p><p> <img alt=\"5 Tactics to Help Your Team Sell From the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tactics-to-Help-Your-Team-Sell-From-the-%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D-Sweet-Fish-Media-4-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><p> Get a story every day from your team about how your product or service helped a customer avoid a pain point or brought pleasure into their business.</p><p> Imagine how sharing a story every day would motivate your team and remind them of the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; behind your product or service. Rather than telling them, you would be &ldquo;showing&rdquo; them real-life examples.</p><h3> 5) Tie Sales Into Their Personal &ldquo;Why&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve instilled the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; of selling your product or service into your sales team, it&rsquo;s time to take the process to the next level: tie business success to personal goals.</p><p> Your sales team spends a good chunk of their week working for you and their customers. Even if they understand and communicate from the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; of your product or service, if it&rsquo;s not tied to their personal &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; the benefit will only last so long.</p><p> When a personal &ldquo;Why&rdquo; and a business &ldquo;Why&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t tied together, the business &ldquo;Why&rdquo; will always lose out.</p><p> <strong>  You can help your sales team tie business success to personal goals in a few ways: </strong></p><li> Encourage your team to develop a personal &ldquo;Why.&rdquo;</li><li> Have each team member create a vision board with pictures of what they define as success.</li><li> Ask each team member to write out the characteristics for which they want to be known.</li><p> Empowering your sales team to tie their personal &ldquo;Why&rdquo; to your business &ldquo;Why&rdquo; will give them a sense of fulfillment in their job&mdash;and help them sell better, too.</p><p> <img alt=\"5 Tactics to Help Your Team Sell From the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-Tactics-to-Help-Your-Team-Sell-From-the-%E2%80%9CWhy%E2%80%9D-Sweet-Fish-Media-5-1024x400.jpg\"/></p><h3> Tactics that Work <br/>  </h3><p> These tactics don&rsquo;t just look good on screen&mdash;they&rsquo;ve been tested and they work!</p><p> Josh Keck uses these five tactics every day to empower his sales team to sell from the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; and has seen the results.</p><p> His team understands the &ldquo;Why&rdquo; behind their business&mdash;to make your work easier and make you look good&mdash;and sells that &ldquo;Why&rdquo; to their customers. The result? A business that is continuing to grow due to a motivated, credible sales team.</p><p> Let Josh&rsquo;s story be yours. Use these tactics to empower your team.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> American business is increasingly global; thus subject to greater global economic impact whether or not a given business is involved in international commerce. <br/>  </h3><p> The extreme disparity among developed and emerging markets and the many economies included inherently increases volatility. </p><p> Political turmoil, acts of terrorism along with several significant humanitarian crises create further global economic instability.</p><p> And, governments, expected to stabilize economies during difficult times have instead contributed to declining economic conditions. Faulty spending priorities, excessive austerity, and failing to act in a timely manner are pushing business leaders and investors away.</p><h3> Key Global Factors and Indicators <br/>  </h3><p> Given the large number of issues capable of triggering substantial worldwide impact, identifying and quantifying a huge number of risk factors can be overwhelming.</p><p> However, several factors span countries and continents. Examples include:</p><li> Geopolitical uncertainty</li><li> Exchange rate volatility</li><li> Global economy instability</li><li> Key industry volatility (e.g. energy)</li><li> Central banks&rsquo; failure to drive positive economic impacts</li><li> Zero inflation &ndash; with deflation fears</li><li> Governments unwilling or unable to stimulate growth</li><li> Global competition</li><li> Weak productivity growth</li><li> China &ndash; Blunders in financial markets drove massive &lsquo;capital flight&rsquo; ($159 billion in December 2015), swiftly increasing debt, ongoing lack of transparency leading to distrust of China&rsquo;s reported growth and financial stability <br/>  </li><h3> International Monetary Fund (IMF) <br/>  </h3><p> IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde&rsquo;s February speech to the &ldquo;Group of 20&rdquo; (G-20) ( 1 ) requested &ldquo;coordinated effort&hellip;to ramp up spending and accelerate delivery of long-promised economic overhauls.&rdquo;</p><p> IMF leadership has repeatedly warned that although the global economy is still growing, we&rsquo;re at a critical juncture; risk of &lsquo;derailment&rsquo; is high.</p><p> European Central Bank &ndash; E.C.B. ( 2 )</p><p> The E.C.B. has boldly entered uncharted territory. Examples:</p><li> Paying commercial banks to borrow money from them. If banks agree to lend these funds to consumers and businesses their interest rate over a four-year loan is negative.</li><li> Lowered their deposit rate (commercial banks&rsquo; interest rate) to -4% from -3% to persuade banks to lend rather than hold cash</li><li> Increasing purchases of government and corporate bonds to pump money into economies <br/>  </li><p> The E.C. B&rsquo;s December 2015 forecast for 2016 inflation was 1.5%; it&rsquo;s now .1%. For over a year 19 Eurozone countries&rsquo; inflation has been at or below zero.</p><h3> Substantial Economic Difficulties Don&rsquo;t Mean a Recession is Imminent <br/>  </h3><p> Leading global economies are in a major slowdown. What&rsquo;s unknown is whether another recession is looming. Economic predictions are notoriously wrong. The Economist&rsquo;s January 2016 issue ( 3 ) reviewed their analysis of IMF forecasts from 1999 to 2014. An economy grew one year, then shrunk the next in 220 instances. Throughout this period IMF forecasts NEVER predicted the coming economic contraction in the following year.</p><h3> United States <br/>  </h3><p> The U.S. appears to be in better shape than most countries. Even so, there is enough uncertainty to temper business&rsquo; appetite for investing in their businesses.</p><p> Business leaders&rsquo; optimism for the 2016 economy has fallen to its lowest level in three years per the Q1 American Institute of CPA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Economic Outlook Survey.&rdquo; ( 4 )</p><p> Only 28% of top-level execs were &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; or &ldquo;very optimistic&rdquo; about 2016 U.S. economy&rsquo;s prospects &ndash; down 17 points from 2015 Q4, and 40 points from 2015 Q1. Another 34% were &ldquo;pessimistic&rdquo; or &ldquo;very pessimistic.&rdquo;</p><p> Business leaders can&rsquo;t count on governmental support. Instead, Washington&rsquo;s gridlock, anti-deficit fever resulting in radical spending cuts &ndash; particularly in key pro-growth areas like R&amp;D and infrastructure &ndash; and the looming presidential election magnify instability.</p><p> Federal level ambivalence: A senior Treasury official was recently quoted downplaying economic conditions as &ldquo;not a crisis&hellip;not warranting a crisis response.&rdquo; The Federal Reserve recently described the outlook as &ldquo;unclear.&rdquo; ( 5 )</p><h3> Looking Forward <br/>  </h3><p> All business leaders must consider how the global economy impacts their businesses. Direct impacts, such as fuel availability and pricing, interest rates, U.S. governmental gridlock and the outcome of the presidential election are obvious.

    "content": "<h3> What do Donald Trump and Barack Obama have in common? <br/>  </h3><p> Believe it or not, they share the same character trait as Sir Winston Churchill, Steve Jobs and Adolf Hitler. They are all able to wow audiences, to fill the room with a certain energy (whether bad or good), and receive standing ovations. Yes, all of these figureheads have charisma in common. People feel drawn to them, attracted to something that makes them stand out and makes them different. Some people are born with it, and others teach themselves how to do it.  </p><p> Steve Jobs, for example, is known for his ability to convince others to believe almost anything. His charismatic characteristics were referred to as his Reality Distortion Field. The term implied that he was able to distort an audience's sense of reality, and to make them believe that every task at hand was possible. More importantly, Jobs trained himself to be charismatic. Yes, charisma can be learnt. It's all about personal mindsets you can adopt, and the nonverbal cues you can use to present them. If you want to boost your charisma, practice a combination of power, warmth and presence. Finally, learn to be a great storyteller.</p><h3> Power <br/>  </h3><p> Power is what others perceive as your ability to make things happen. Show that you believe in your abilities, values, and knowledge. Your confidence will inspire your employees' faith in you and your leadership.</p><p> The cues that help you communicate your personal power lie in your posture, your dress code, and your voice.</p><li> <p>  Posture: Stand with your arms open. Own your space. Sit up straight. Stand tall with your head held high. </p></li><li> <p>  Dress code: Dress appropriately - Act the part, and you will become the part (William James) </p></li><li> <p>  Voice: The act of talking slowly tells others that you are in control. Being loud is not equal to being dominant. </p></li><h3> Warmth <br/>  </h3><p> Confidence is essential but there is a line between great confidence and narcissism. Going to the wrong end of the scale, you risk disengaging people. Stay warm and connected. It's important to know that you cannot fake warmth. You can be polite with gentle nods and friendly smiles but warmth comes from deeper inside. Remove barriers and let people in. Connect and love.</p><h3> Presence <br/>  </h3><p> You need to be completely here, in this moment. Take Bill Clinton as an example. Many say that when they're with him, they not only feel his power and sense of warm engagement, they can also feel his complete presence.</p><p> You want to maintain a high attention to the people you are interacting with. The ability to notice when your mind wanders and redirect your thoughts back into the present moment is a leadership habit. It takes constant practice but you'll find this ability rewarding when you want to be appealing to others.</p><p> Some nonverbal behaviours you should pay attention to:</p><li> <p>  Eye contact: Make eye contact with those you talk to. Warm, friendly eye contact tells others that you are present and interested in what they have to say. </p></li><li> <p>  Body language: Open your arms and shoulders towards ones you are conversing with. Avoid distracting habits, like playing with a pen or glancing at your phone. </p></li><p> Spare a minute, and think about the following response that someone gave when asked about her impression of the two English political leaders, William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli, after dining with them:</p><p> &ldquo;When I left the dining room after sitting next to Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But after sitting next to Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest woman in England&rdquo;</p><p> Lessons: Share your confidence with others. Show your personal power but do not forget to focus your energy and attention on their presence.</p><h3> The stories you tell <br/>  </h3><p> Have you heard the story Steve Jobs told Stanford&rsquo;s graduates about how he stumbled into inventing beautiful typography for the first Macintosh? He put his story in the context of his adopting history. He drew people in with the value that is core to most if not all: family. He shared personal information. He never graduated from college but he was giving a speech at one of the world&rsquo;s most prestigious universities. The irony intrigued people to want to hear more. His emotions drew you in and inspired you to &ldquo;follow your heart&rdquo;, and &rdquo;stay hungry, stay foolish&rdquo;. If you haven&rsquo;t, watch the talk and you'll know what I mean.</p><p> Lessons: Learn to craft meaningful, emotional stories. Practice the arts of humor, metaphor, and symbolism so you can entertain while you inform.</p><p> In brief, everyone can learn to enhance their charisma but it does involve a lot of work. You need to understand your power, practice your presence and deliver the two with warmth. Learn to tell stories that people want to hear, that talk to their heart and inspire them to follow you.</p><p> By using Impraise, you can easily develop the skills you need to successfully supervise your team. Ask your team to send you feedback anytime and engage with your team members to understand where your key strengths and potential blind spots lie. Over time you will develop your own personal brand of charisma.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The S&amp;P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index had a 0.5% return for February, but that is after bottoming out at mid-month and rallying 3.7% in the final two weeks.</h3><p> <br/> Matthew Fuller, a director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Leveraged Commentary &amp; Data, said the rally was underpinned by healthier economic news, strong inflows to the investment style and a dearth of new issuance. <br/> <br/> Neuberger Berman High Income Bond Fund (NHINX) was the most popular taxable high yield mutual fund in February. With the addition of $550 million of new money, the portfolio increased in size by 20% to $3.5 billion; the institutional share class has $2.5 billion in assets. Despite underperforming its high yield peers in 2014 and 2015, the fund's year-to-date through February gain of 0.1% was stronger than its peers' 1.2% decline.  <br/> <br/> The fund has a 5.9% 30-day SEC yield, moderately below the 6.3% for its peers. Meanwhile, relative to its peers, the fund's 48% exposure to bonds rated BB or equivalent is higher, while its 26% in bonds rated B is lower, supporting our favorable overall S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence ranking. <br/> <br/> T Rowe Price High Yield (PRHYX) and AB High Income Fund (AGDAX) pulled in $228 million and $180 million of new money, though the fund's size grew more modestly than those previously mentioned. <br/> <br/> Navigator Tactical Fixed Income (NTBIX) is an alternative credit focus fund that which employs a tactical approach between high yield, Treasuries, and cash. Sean Clark, one of NTBIX's portfolio managers, believes that investors will be rewarded for moving into lower credit fixed income sectors during a rising interest rate environment as long as risk is being managed.  <br/> <br/> According to Clark, there is a big disconnect between where the economy is and where high yield is trading. The fund holds stakes in AB High Income and Lord Abbett High Yield Fund. <br/> <br/> Meanwhile, Aberdeen Global High Income (BJBHX) experienced $405 million in outflows in February, which helped cut its asset base of $843 million by a third. The fund's 3.33% decline in the first two months follows underperformance in 2014 and 2015.  <br/> <br/> In the latest S&amp;P Dow Jones Index Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecard, 66% of all high yield funds outperformed the Barclays High Yield index in 2015, though only 42% and 21% succeeded on a three- and five-year basis. Investors not seeking active management should look at SPDR Barclays High Yield ETF (JNK), which has a 0.40% expense ratio. JNK had $462 million of inflows in February. <br/> <br/> Meanwhile, Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond (NHMAX) was the most popular high yield municipal bond fund last month, pulling in $241 million of new assets. NHMAX outperformed its Lipper peer group in 2014 and 2015; its 1.13% year-to-date through February gain was fractionally ahead of its peers.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WagnerLawGroup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Stephen P. Wilkes  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://wagnerlawgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   The Wagner Law Group  </u> </a></p><h3> With the imminent release of the proposed ERISA fiduciary regulation in final form, many financial advisors are weighing the pros and cons of delivering participant investment advice.</h3><p> <br/> Does the \"Best Interest Contract Exemption\" impose costs and responsibilities that are too onerous for my firm?   Should I move from a varying commission- based compensation structure to a level fee payout?</p><p> For many broker-dealer firms, there may be a viable path forward by going to a robo-advisory program that incorporates the statutory computer model exemption under ERISA Section 408(b)(14) and (g)(1) or its predecessor, the SunAmerica advisory opinion. However, be advised that FINRA is also looking closely at rob-advisory programs and issued a report on March 15, 2016 (Report on Digital Investment Advice, the \"Report\"), dealing with its perspective on suitability and conflicts of interest where digital investment advice tools are used to render investment advice. The Report does not appear to change or create any new legal requirements, but certainly stands for the proposition that firms must identify and maintain appropriate procedures involving digital tools used for investment advice.</p><h3> <strong>  Governance and Supervision.   </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Report indicates that firms should establish appropriate governance and supervisory procedures that enable the full understanding of the digital tool, including how both the financial adviser and the client will use it. It also recommends that the firm test and review all aspects of the digital tool including the underlying algorithms used to develop investment strategies and models. Testing should be especially sensitive to preferences or biases that are built into the methodology, so as to avoid inappropriate results for any client.  </p><h3> <strong>  Customer Portfolio Construction and Conflicts of Interest. </strong></h3><p> <br/> In addition to algorithms, the Report takes a close look at the construction and rebalancing of portfolios, and the overlay of suitability and conflict of interest rules. The Report is quite clear in its recommendation that a financial advisor needs to have all of the appropriate data about a customer in order to advise on the establishment or adjustment of a portfolio that is suitable and conflict fee. FINRA rules call for a proper vetting of a client profile at account opening and subsequently when offering investment recommendations. Proper due diligence should consider many factors, including but certainly not limited to age, tax status, investment objectives, liquidity needs, and time horizon. These traditional elements of due diligence and defining suitability for each client are not superseded or reduced in any way by the use of digital investment tools. In fact, the Report provides an example of a relevant questions for profiling purposes and offers some guidance on how to address incomplete or contradictory answers to client profile questions</p><p> The Report emphasizes that conflicts of interest principles as articulated by FINRA rules are very much applicable to the digital platform. Disclosure remains the primary means of addressing conflict situations.</p><h3> <strong>  Training. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The proper training of registered representatives on the use of digital investment tools, including their inherent strengths and weaknesses, is highly encouraged. Good training would not only include the proper use of the digital investment tool, but appropriate indicators for when its use may not be suitable for a particular client.  </p><h3> <strong>  Lessons for Investors. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Report states that clients should also consider various issues when using a digital investment advice. The lessons fall into three main categories: suitability of investment, rebalancing of portfolios, and conflicts of interest.</p><p> Robo-advisory programs are becoming more prevalent as technology improves and the financial services market develops new approaches to the long standing problem of delivering investment advice to clients in a fashion that not only is legally compliant, but reflects best practices and is meaningful to the individual. The ERISA final regulation may provide yet another incentive for the robo-advisory market to grow. The DOL will be looking for compliance by financial service firms with the terms and conditions of the computer model exemption.   FINRA has effectively announced that it, too, will require its member firms to structure robo-advisory programs within the current regulatory framework of suitability and conflict of interest disclosure.   It is incumbent on those firms using a robo-advisor platform to identify and assess potential issues now, and be sure to incorporate appropriate processes and procedures that will satisfy not only DOL but FINRA as well.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What Really Lies Behind the Procrastination? <br/>  </h3><p> We all catch ourselves doing it: procrastinating. For some, it only rears its ugly head on occasion. For others, it is a daily struggle. Procrastination on a personal level can be difficult. But, on an organizational level procrastination can wreak havoc. As Mason Cooley explains in the above quote, procrastination makes everything more difficult than it needs to be. So, what really lies behind the procrastination in your organization?</p><h3> Is it fear? <br/>  </h3><p> Sometimes people fear undertaking a task, making a decision, or taking an action. This fear can stem from the dread of possible failure, from the thought of reprimand, or from possible judgment from others. Therefore, people often think it&rsquo;s easier to put off until tomorrow what could be done today. Ironically, that which we fear will still be waiting for us tomorrow, the next day, and the next. When we dread a task, we are usually making it out to be bigger than it really is. As a leader, you must develop trusting relationships with your employees and between team members where people feel safe to take action and make decisions. You must also build a culture where failure is viewed as a learning opportunity instead of an excuse to criticize. Do people in your organization procrastinate because of fear?</p><h3> Is it distraction? <br/>  </h3><p> With technology so readily available; social networks; and entertainment at our fingertips, it is easy to become distracted. Busy work is another distraction that actually tricks people into thinking they are making progress. Even with the best of intentions, tasks that should be done now often get put off until later due simply to distractions. As a leader, you must help employees learn to prioritize the important tasks so that busy work does not end up at the top of the to-do list. It is also important that employees have some down-time in their schedule where they can take a break and allow themselves momentary distraction from the task at hand. Do people in your organization procrastinate because they are tied up with busy work or otherwise distracted?</p><h3> Is it a lack of direction? <br/>  </h3><p> Sometimes people don&rsquo;t take action because they are not sure where to start or in which direction they should be going. This is further complicated in organizations where employees are often dependent on leaders to provide direction. Is there a real purpose for the delay? Is a situation under reevaluation? Do decisions need to be made before action can be taken? As a leader, it is your duty to ensure that your people have a clear understanding of what they are responsible for accomplishing and what, if any, foreseeable barriers stand in their way. Are people in your organization procrastinating because they lack direction?</p><h3> Is it a habit? <br/>  </h3><p> One of the worst things about procrastination is that it can so easily become a habit. Once procrastination has reached the level of being a habit people no longer need fear, distraction, or lack of direction to keep them from taking action. It is easy to develop the habit of procrastination if we do not intentionally develop the habit of making a plan ahead of time and then sticking to the plan, one step at a time. As a leader, it is your responsibility to help people recognize the habit of procrastination, to help them develop a plan, and then hold them accountable for sticking to the plan. Is procrastination wreaking havoc in your organization simply because it has become a habit?</p><h3> Slay the Demon <br/>  </h3><p> So, how do you slay the procrastination demon in your organization? As a leader, you must help people overcome any fear that may be preventing them from taking action. Teach them to block tasks together, scheduling small chunks of time where they allow for brief periods of distraction before getting back on task without interruption. Clearly communicate direction to your employees, work together to develop a plan that is broken down into milestones, and then hold people accountable for sticking to the plan. Don&rsquo;t allow important tasks to get buried underneath layers of busy work. Help employees to recognize when procrastination has become a habit. Set clear objectives and timelines to keep employees on task and on target. Educate employees and managers about the symptoms, causes, and consequences of persistent procrastination. Has it become a habit? Get started today and slay the demon.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Who&rsquo;s that Man, Daddy? <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ve seen those Schwab commercials on TV where the dad explains to his child what his broker does. These ads are promoting a &lsquo;money-back&rsquo; guarantee if clients aren&rsquo;t happy with the advice. I just wrote an article published in Bottom Line Personal today explaining how that guarantee works.</p><p> A money-back guarantee might seem like an enticing assurance that a product or service is reliable. But when it comes to choosing an investment firm, it&rsquo;s not very useful.</p><p> Charles Schwab has been offering to refund investment advisory fees when investors are unhappy, and TD Ameritrade has been offering to rebate the fees after two quarters of negative performance.</p><h3> As I have traveled around the country, some investors have expressed excitement to me over these offers.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The problem: </strong>  Many investors mistakenly believe that they will get better advice because of the offers and will be protected from investment losses. The guarantees are not a good reason to select a particular brokerage or a useful way to judge the value of the help you get.</p><p> How the offers work: Schwab&rsquo;s &shy;&ldquo;Accountability Guarantee&rdquo; allows customers who use any of five advisory services to request a refund of fees for the previous quarter for any reason. The services include Schwab Managed Portfolios, whose model portfolios of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are selected with the help of an adviser (minimum investment $25,000), and Schwab Private Client, which provides an adviser who creates a portfolio tailored for you (minimum investment $500,000). Annual fees are 0.9% of your managed assets or lower.</p><p> TD Ameritrade&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discretionary Service Fee Rebate&rdquo; applies to its Amerivest service, which provides an adviser to help you select among several model portfolios. If your holdings experience two consecutive quarters of negative returns, Amerivest will automatically refund the fees from both quarters. Amerivest requires a $25,000 minimum investment and charges an annual fee of up to 1.25% of managed assets. The guarantees do not reimburse investment losses.</p><p> <strong>  My take:  </strong> Schwab and TD Ameritrade are worried about losing clients to much-lower-cost services known as robo-advisers offered by firms ranging from online newcomers to giants such as Vanguard and Schwab itself. Robo-&shy;advisers generally charge 0.35% or less to generate model porfolios of ETFs&mdash;&shy;although most won&rsquo;t put you in touch with a human adviser.</p><p> But a money-back guarantee is not helpful in choosing the best human adviser. It&rsquo;s better to look for advisers with long, solid track records. And you should avoid judging their advice based on your portfolio&rsquo;s returns from one quarter to the next.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;re investing in a website for your company, there&rsquo;s a good chance that you want to use it to attract the attention of more potential customers.</p><p> However, ensuring that your site can be found easily on the web is a complicated science. One of the most important factors is SEO &mdash; or search engine optimization &mdash; which can determine where your website appears in search engine results.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve written before about how  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/seo-ranking-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   search engine rankings themselves are worthless  </a> </u> , and that you should be  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/ways-to-increase-website-conversion-rate/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   paying attention to how your website is optimized for conversion  </a> </u>  if you want to get business from your website.</p><p> While rankings aren&rsquo;t as important as what happens after a potential customer finds your website, showing up in search engines is incredibly important. Showing up for the most relevant searches with high buying intent is difficult.</p><p> That&rsquo;s because there are tons of factors that play into a site&rsquo;s SEO. In fact, Google has a whole  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/insidesearch/howsearchworks/algorithms.html\" target=\"_blank\">   secret algorithm  </a> </u>  to calculate it (but you knew that).</p><p> What you may not be as familiar with is that one important factor that many businesses overlook is the site&rsquo;s actual development. These five SEO-focused web development tips will help your website get the notice it deserves.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Build a Mobile Responsive Website </strong></h3><p> <br/> I bet you use your mobile phone or tablet to view websites as much as you view websites on desktop or laptop computers. Everyone does. It&rsquo;s a trend that&rsquo;s hard to dispute. Just look at your Google Analytics to find out.</p><p> Today, many people are shifting their Internet use from desktop computers to mobile devices (like a tablet or smartphone). So, if you want all of your potential customers to be able see and use your website no matter what device they&rsquo;re on,  <u>  <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/why-your-business-needs-a-mobile-friendly-website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you need to design it responsively  </a> </u> .</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/website-design/responsive-web-design\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Responsive design  </a> </u>  uses technology that can detect what size screen and device a page is being viewed on, then present that page in the way that looks and functions best for that specific on-screen environment.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re familiar with web development, you know that happens with media queries in your CSS file. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, then send this article to your IT staff or development partner.</p><p> Responsive design can boost SEO because it helps lower your bounce rate and because  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/ways-technology-has-changed-website-redesign/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Google takes into account &ldquo;mobile-friendliness&rdquo; when calculating a site&rsquo;s SEO score  </a> </u> , especially if the search occurs on a mobile device.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Keep Pages as Small as Possible </strong></h3><p> <br/> Images make a website look great, but put too many on the page or don&rsquo;t reduce their file size and they can also cause a page to load slowly, which detracts from its SEO score.</p><p> A good company website balances the need for good, high-quality images with good typography and uses words rather than text in graphics when possible.</p><p> Ensure that your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.business2community.com/seo/7-ways-optimize-image-files-seo-0991081#LUYADBsMfKBP5dod.97\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   image files  </a> </u>  are as small as possible so that your page loads quickly. One web development tip for this is to resize images before uploading them to your website. Some content management systems resize an image by changing the height and width dimensions in HTML, but they actually are loading the large original image. This is slowing down your website for visitors but also counting against your load times for SEO.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Enable Caching </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another way to help your page&rsquo;s load time is to allow for  <u>  <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching?csw=1\" target=\"_blank\">   page caching  </a> </u> . When your page is  <u>  <a href=\"http://seositecheckup.com/articles/how-page-caching-optimizes-your-site-performance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   cached  </a> </u> , it is stored on a visitor&rsquo;s browser as a static, HTML version of your site.</p><p> This means that when a visitor returns to your site, they don&rsquo;t have to reload your entire page. When developing your site, you can designate whether the page can be cached, who it can be cached by, and how long it can be stored.</p><p> It&rsquo;s also a good idea to enable template caching and query caching for content management systems to speed up your website. Why pay special attention to load time and these technical aspects of your website? A slow website can cost you search rankings,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/is-a-slow-website-costing-you-sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   but can also cost you leads  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  4. Integrate Social Media Sharing on Blog, News, Press Releases and Downloadable Resources </strong></h3><p> <br/> Having your website shared on  <u>  <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/social-media-ranking-search-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media  </a> </u>  is a great way to boost its SEO. Make it easy for people to share your content on their social media profiles by including sharing buttons or toolbars. This will allow them to directly place a link to your page somewhere all of their followers can see it, with only the simple click of the button. This is also a great chance for you to take advantage of some free marketing!</p><p> On note of caution. Social media icons don&rsquo;t belong at the top of every page on your website &ndash; they belong at the bottom. On specific pages, social sharing buttons need to be small and unobtrusive, but embedded in the content of your page.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Strive for Better Usability </strong></h3><p> <br/> Good SEO isn&rsquo;t just about keywords. You have to provide a good experience to customers who visit your website. Is your page relevant to their web search? Does it match their expectations?</p><p> Usability really brings into play several things that you should pay attention to:</p><li> Content &ndash; is your company website a resource to potential customers?</li><li> Design &ndash; is your website well designed and easy to navigate?</li><li> Development &ndash; does your website load in under 2 seconds? Is it properly browser-tested?</li><li> Responsive web design &ndash; is your website readable on a mobile phone? <br/>  </li><p> One metric that you should measure on your high-impact pages is bounce rate. A high bounce rate over 50% will let you know that you need to make usability improvements to a page, because people are visiting and leaving.</p><p> A company website can serve many purposes, but one of the most important is to help you drum up more business. By developing with SEO in mind, you can help ensure that your site is a tool for generating new leads and converting more sales.</p><br />",

    "content": "<h3> It&rsquo;s only now that I am an adult and have been reading more about characteristics of introverts that I realize there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with me. It&rsquo;s simply who I am. </h3><p> <br/> Sometimes I hate it.</p><p> I hate it even more that my oldest son is just like me and I am sad for all the things he&rsquo;s likely to choose to skip out on because he shares the same unavoidable introverted traits.</p><p> Since he was a toddler, Nick would never do anything in public if he hadn&rsquo;t yet perfected it his place of comfort &ndash; home.</p><p> Several times, his daycare would call me at work&hellip;</p><p> &ldquo;Great news,&rdquo; they called to tell me, &ldquo;Nick is walking!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Ummm&hellip; okay?&rdquo; I responded confusedly, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been walking at home for a while.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;We just wanted to let you know that Nick said his first words today!&rdquo; said the director on another occasion.</p><p> &ldquo;He what? He&rsquo;s been speaking at home for months in full sentences,&rdquo; I replied.</p><p> And so it has gone for all 13 years of his life.</p><p> Most recently, he has struggled with the decision of whether or not to continue taking piano and guitar lessons. Why? Because a new curriculum now requires a performance to graduate to the next level.</p><p> For that, he&rsquo;s willing to throw away two years of learning.</p><p> But then there he is on stage for his school play for the second year in a row &ndash; in front of more than a hundred people.</p><p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; I said to him, &ldquo;How is this any different? A five-minute performance in front of a few people is far less daunting than what you&rsquo;re doing on stage.&rdquo;</p><h3> &ldquo;It IS different,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing a ROLE. And besides, if I mess up, there&rsquo;s always someone there to pick it back up and keep it going.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Now, THOSE are terms I understand.</p><p> &ldquo;Nick,&rdquo; I started, &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m shy? And I don&rsquo;t like to initiate conversations with people I don&rsquo;t know, right?&rdquo;</p><p> He nodded.</p><p> &ldquo;Do you know that I worked at a music store when I was a teenager? And my job was to go up and talk to strangers to see if they needed anything. I was actually good at it! Do you know WHY I was good at it?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he responded.</p><p> &ldquo;Because I put on my uniform and stepped into the role. People saw me with my shirt and nametag and expected nothing less of me.&rdquo;</p><p> The reality is that everything in life &ndash; parenting, jobs, relationships -- is a role that you step into regardless of whether or not you have the physical uniform to go with it.</p><h3> And whether that role requires you to perform for one, a few or a few hundred, there is always someone there to back you up and keep you moving &ndash; even if that person is you.</h3>",

    "content": "<p> Millennials, the roughly 80 million 12-34 year old Americans that grew up immersed in technology and who are about to become the recipients of the greatest transfer of wealth in history, have recently surpassed the baby boomers as our largest living generation. They are expected to continue to grow through immigration, until peaking in 2036,</p><p> As a group, according to research completed by Accenture in 2013, they are more conservative and less trusting of financial advisors than previous generations,</p><p> However, as part of the valuable &ldquo;Generation D&rdquo; - the 75 million digitally savvy U.S. investors with high-incomes, assets, and education; who control approximately $27 trillion in total assets &ndash; the millennials can no longer be ignored by financial planning firms.</p><p> There is no question that the Millennial group is different and will require an updated marketing plan to attract. They like to multitask, have shorter attention spans, and have greater access to outside information and references &ndash; which they will use in making big decisions.</p><p> This is not to say that there is not a huge opportunity for advisors interested in working with this group &ndash; millennials are more interested than other groups in mastering investment strategy, and in building and passing along wealth to their families. However, planners interested in attracting millennial clients will have show to a willingness to move away from, or expand on, traditional marketing techniques.</p><h3> Marketing to Millennials <br/>  </h3><p> Millennials want to get to know you BEFORE contacting you &ndash; not in an introductory &ldquo;get to know you&rdquo; meeting. By the time they contact you, they will have done a significant amount of research on you using their social networks and other online tools. One of your goals as a marketer is to make &ldquo;getting to know you&rdquo; easier for them. </p><p> In addition, the survey revealed pent up demand for investor educational resources, and easier advisor access. By creating an active, transparent, and educational presence online &ndash; website, blog, video, social media, newsletter &ndash; you can answer their questions while narrowing the existing trust gap.</p><h3> Other Considerations <br/>  </h3><li> They have grown up doing business online, and prefer the convenience and accessibility of online transactions when available, often including video meetings instead of face-to-face.</li><li> They dislike complexity, and value simple visuals over lengthy instructions. Design your website and materials to be easily skimmed, with visuals when appropriate.</li><li> They have easy access to financial planners across the country,your competition, so they expect a high level of customer service, including quick and easy access to information and answers to their questions. <br/>  </li><h3> Marketing Solution <br/>  </h3><p> Develop an online presence built around educational material that is shared on your website and blog and through various social media platforms. Be active on social media, sharing original content and other relevant information, and responding to questions or comments thoughtfully and in a reasonable time frame. Have you considered having an app developed?</p><p> Offer as much of your service online as possible &ndash; self scheduling of appointments, live chat, video conferencing, etc. Respond to your email or texts (often their preferred means of communication) in a timely manner &ndash; use auto generated messages to notify contacts if you will be delayed in responding more than a day.</p><p> This is not to suggest that you should be available 24/7, but you may have to establish and communicate a reasonable contact policy to your clients.</p><p> Good luck with your millennial marketing! What experiences have you had with millennial clients? As always questions and comments are welcome and appreciated.</p>",

When I changed the tilt of my writing for that cadre, I discovered that my unsubscribe rate INCREASED.

Wasn&rsquo;t I good enough to grace their inbox?</p><p> Intellectually I knew I was making the right decision based on clear evidence that my real client and audience base would deeply value that tilt.

    "link": "your-most-powerful-differentiator-the-live-performance",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> An extraordinary shift has occurred in the music business, and it holds an important lesson for us. <br/>  </h3><p> Over the last decade, sales of recorded music have steadily declined. This includes all types of music in all formats&mdash;CDs, digital downloads, and so on.</p><p> At the same time, concert ticket revenue for live pop concerts has steadily risen. These trends are displayed below, in the graph.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-29-at-11.31.52-AM-2.png\" width=\"412\"/></p><p> Buying a digital recording of some old Rolling Stones songs you&rsquo;ve already heard is one thing; going to see the Stones live is quite another. Their live performance is worth a lot to a fan.</p><h3> <strong>  What&rsquo;s going on? And why is this relevant to us? </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are many reasons for the decline in recorded music sales, not least the fact that there is now vastly more competition for our ears and eyes&mdash;think satellite radio, Internet radio, video games, you name it.</p><p> What this trend underscores is the fact that a good live performance can create a lifetime memory. It hits your emotions, your senses, and your analytical brain all at once. It&rsquo;s the difference between reading that boring history textbook in college and going to hear your brilliant history professor give a charged-up, energetic talk about the battle of Gettysburg.</p><p> Clients&ndash;like all of us&ndash;value an engaging, live performance. But increasingly, they do not assign a high value to written reports, analyses, memos, and yes, even physical products themselves. A case-in-point of the latter is IBM. It used to get most of its revenue from hardware. Then, from software. And now, much of their income comes from the intangible services, such as consulting, that surround and enable the hardware and software&mdash;in a sense, the &ldquo;live performance&rdquo; element of their service mix.</p><p> To put it bluntly, you may think there&rsquo;s huge value in that report you turn in to the client with all of sorts of great information and analyses. But what is really valuable to your client is your live performance. It&rsquo;s having a conversation with your client about your analysis and your conclusions. It&rsquo;s helping them to reframe the problem and consider their options. It&rsquo;s raising the potential risks and helping them evaluate those risks in light of their organization&rsquo;s specific strengths and weaknesses. It&rsquo;s a conversation that helps your client make the right decision or use your solutions more effectively.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s an example of the ultimate live performance, chronicled in a recent New York Times article &ldquo;Goldman, Citi, UBS&hellip;and a Guy in an Office.&rdquo; Paul J. Taubman, a former Morgan Stanley banker, basically set up shop as an independent M&amp;A advisor, and in 2013 he was credited with $175 billion in deals&mdash;putting him at number 11 on the league tables, surrounded by major investment banks on either side. Incredible, really. This is an extreme example, but it illustrates the power of the live performance. Taubman was not spending a lot of his time writing PowerPoint slides and doing spreadsheets for Verizon and the other clients he advised. No, he was out in front of his clients, on his feet, helping them navigate the intricacies of major deals.</p><h3> <strong>  Why the live performance eclipses reports and even products </strong></h3><p> <br/> There are a number of reasons why the live performance is so important in today&rsquo;s markets:</p><li> <strong>  Information and data, alone, are mostly commodities. </strong> Brokerage reports analyzing the stock market, for example, used to be only available to a firm&rsquo;s best clients. Now, virtually anyone can download them from the Internet.</li><li> <strong>  Products are commodities. </strong> Even a breakthrough product like the iPhone is supported and enhanced by best-in-class telephone customer service as well as Genius Bars in hundreds of Apple stores all around the world, where you can get a personal consultation for free.</li><li> <strong>  The value of what you do lies in the application of your products and services to the client&rsquo;s business problems and opportunities. </strong> The live performance ensures that happens.</li><li> <strong>  A conversation is a dynamic, fluid event that can quickly adapt to a client&rsquo;s real problem or most pressing issues. </strong> A written document is utterly static and cannot adapt itself on the fly.</li><li> <strong>  It&rsquo;s hard to make a written report or memo &ldquo;stand out&rdquo; and wow the client. </strong> But a great live performance can do exactly that. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  How to increase and improve your live performances with clients </strong></h3><p> <br/> <strong>  First, </strong> reallocate time from report writing and formatting, internal meetings, etc. and hold more live meetings with prospects and clients. Instead of working on those PowerPoint slides till midnight&mdash;have dinner with your client to discuss your ideas and suggestions for improving their business.</p><p> <strong>  Second, </strong> rehearse your live performances. If you play tennis or golf seriously, how many times do you practice your serve or putt in order to perfect them? How about your client conversations and sales pitches? Clients tell me that many professionals who present to them are woefully underprepared for their live performances. They ask poor questions or none at all, and lack coordination with the others on their team.</p><p> <strong>  Third, </strong> make sure you&rsquo;re in sync with your colleagues. When the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964, they were relaxed, musically tight, and noticeably having a great time. But what most people don&rsquo;t realize is how much face time they had invested in together, leading up to what was their effective debut on the world stage&mdash;for example, 293 shows at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, and thousands of hours on stage together in Hamburg, Germany and throughout England in small town halls and clubs.</p><p> <strong>  Fourth, </strong> create more informal client interactions over coffee, lunch, dinner, and so on. Meet with your client in-between major events or project milestones, just to share what you&rsquo;re seeing in the marketplace and to ask them thoughtful questions about their evolving priorities. Remember, the live performance doesn&rsquo;t have to be a big sound-and-light show at Madison Square Garden. It can be an intimate conversation over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine.</p><p> <strong>  And fifth, </strong> be willing to travel to see the your clients to have more live performances, and double-up when you do travel. Going to Chicago for the day? Try and connect with another prospect or client for a quick visit before you leave.</p><p> Doing your email for two hours in the morning doesn&rsquo;t add a lot of perceived value to clients. Nor does editing and re-editing that report until you think it&rsquo;s perfect. In my experience, no report or memo survives contact with the client&mdash;you need the live performance to really engage with your client and process your insights for them in a way that is practical and leads to real change.</p><p> Are you getting enough live performances in front of your prospects and clients? Remember, if you want milk, you have to get out of your house, trudge through the snow, and go out to the barn. Are you willing to put your boots on?</p> ",

    "title": "4 Tools to Create a Beautiful Balance in Managing Business \"Expectations\"",
    "link": "4-tools-to-create-a-beautiful-balance-in-managing-business-expectations",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> As you create and manage your business, balancing your expectations is critical to success. It's never been more important than ever to learn how expectations affect success. <br/>  </h3><p> Recent events will illustrate the importance and differences in expectations.  </p><p> For example, Forbes magazine reported that Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg is now worth $ 40 billion. Would anyone have &ldquo;expected&rdquo; that to happen? To a weird college kid with practically no capital and no revenue a few years ago?</p><p> And, take the recent presidential debates that featured 17 candidates who all thought they had an edge with exaggerated expectations. What happened at the end of the day was wasted time and energy, and stress to the listener.</p><p> On one hand, you must maintain your enthusiasm, confidence, and belief that you will succeed. You don&rsquo;t want to even entertain the notion of failing, because it will affect your confidence level and those around you. </p><p> It opens up the door to doubt, which can detour creative energies (really, who wants to do business with someone who is carries an air of failure?). Rather, believe that the glass is always half full, rather than half empty. With the real potential for a deluge.</p><p> Keep in mind, however, the challenges, barriers, and realities of your efforts. Remember that new programs, initiatives, and  product launches will take more time, money, and effort than you imagine.  So, add in additional back-up time, should you need it.  By doing so, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re &ldquo;expecting&rdquo; failure, or that there&rsquo;s a flaw in your plan, it&rsquo;s being &ldquo;business responsible.&rdquo;</p><p> In addition, because the market changes, and your customers&rsquo; lifestyles change by the nano-second, you need to be able to pivot along with it.  By &ldquo;expecting&rdquo; that your market can change from year to year, you are being proactive in your thinking, and can create flexible plans to adapt in these changes.</p><h3> <strong>  Here are four tools to create a beautiful balance in your &ldquo;expectations&rdquo;: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Beware of confirmation bias <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t we always belief our ideas are terrific, and thus, focus more on their wonderfulness and potential for success? Of course we do. The challenges are sometimes given a smaller amount of our attention, and downplayed.  It&rsquo;s just human nature.  We bias our analysis towards successes and positives, and tend to ignore negatives. One business that has benefited greatly from this concept is the casino business.</p><p> An example of an unbalanced concept of expectations is when a business owner says, &ldquo;We have no competition.&rdquo;  Believing that there is no one else out there doing what you do is doomed thinking.  After all, how were they getting it done before your business entered the market?  Every business has a competitor of some sort. Even if it&rsquo;s simply competing for the time and money of your customer.</p><p> Take the time to research and consider alternative solutions and analysis. Consider what could go wrong, what mistakes could occur and have contingency plans for delays or changes in results.</p><h3> 2. Develop, test, measure, and adapt <br/>  </h3><p> Many plans, forecasts, and proposals are done in a static format with one dimensional analysis and results.  Usually, they&rsquo;re all wrong, because we live in a more dynamic and interactive world. For example, branding, marketing, pricing, and operations all must be viewed as an integrated program, rather than separate and isolated activities. Similarly, businesses need to have alternatives at the ready, and the processes in place to adapt.  Mistakes will occur.  But, remember, Steve Jobs got fired, and Tom Edison tested thousands of light bulbs before succeeding.</p><h3> 3. Understand your goals <br/>  </h3><p> Understand your goals, resources, and risk. In particular, really understand your market analysis, competition, how and why your company is different, and why customers should care. Are you focused on long term growth, or quick profits?</p><p> Marketing programs vary in cost and impact. In general, paid search can have immediate results, while social media is more long term and branding-orientated. While testing alternatives is a great strategy, ensure that you are focused on priorities that you can execute and that will have the most potential.</p><h3> 4. When and how will you be profitable? <br/>  </h3><p> Only about 10% of startups and small businesses succeed and survive to their fifth year. The ones who did survive developed flexible models to measure and then compared alternatives.</p><p> Consider the following:</p><li> Do you have the expertise and excellence to support and justify your programs?</li><li> Do you have the resources to survive the &ldquo;slower than expected&rdquo; startup, or, on the other hand, are you ready to pounce when the business needs to expand? <br/>  </li><p> No matter the size of your business, understand the risk and uncertainty of your decisions. It has been shown that successful startups had a healthy balance of excitement, an understanding of the risks they were taking, and had a backup plan when an unexpected turn developed.</p><p> I have learned that traditional, and detailed, startup recommendations like planning and budgeting, are not as important as previously thought. Rather, the process needs to be continuous to analyze, measure, and adapt to changing parameters, programs, markets, and risks.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> How does your voice sound and what words do you choose? <br/>  </h3><p> Branding is ultra important for your firm as well as for you personally. But what&rsquo;s your voice saying about you? It&rsquo;s putting out messages that may not represent you. Your voice and your speech are a huge part of your brand.</p><h3> Your Voice <br/>  </h3><p> Is your voice tight and in your throat? You may sound aggressive or in a bad mood. (Aggressive is not the same thing as authoritative, by the way. If, in an attempt to sound authoritative you sound aggressive than you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.) To have a credible, authoritative, yet warm sound you need to open your throat &amp; use a lot of air. This results in a full, resonant sound that comes across as credible &amp; highly persuasive.</p><p> Do you place your resonance in the front of your mouth? To get a gorgeous, magnetic sound you need to place your resonance over the back of the tongue. People are drawn to you, they listen to you &amp; they do what you tell &rsquo;em when you have a magnetic sound. </p><p> My clients are super smart go-getters. They say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s standing in the way of my getting what I need out of life? In order to get what I need out of life people need to find me credible and authoritative. That leads to my being persuasive. That&rsquo;s how I get what I need out of life.&rdquo; So my clients have the cajones to record themselves. With me. We do it together. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt! They comprehend that when they know:</p><p> 1. Specifically what they&rsquo;re doing wrong and </p><p> 2. How to fix it </p><p> they can make improvements in their lives permanently! We have to study the sciences, languages&ndash;all academics in school. We go to the gym and learn how to play sports &amp; musical instruments. We weren&rsquo;t born the best that we can possibly be. We were given talents and it&rsquo;s up to us to improve upon them.  Beethoven studied under a few composers! (Most famously, Hadyn) He was born with incredible talent but he still had to study! If you want to be persuasive and get people to really believe in your brand you need to put some time in.</p><h3> Your Words <br/>  </h3><p> What words are you choosing? Are your words making you seem abrupt or even wishy-washy? Do you use 10 words when you could&rsquo;ve delivered your point in fewer?</p><p> Are you putting your communicative partners first when you speak? (I&rsquo;m referring to everyone with whom you communicate. An audience, a client, your team, etc.)  That gorgeous Maya Angelou said, </p><p> I&rsquo;ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</p><p> Your words and your tone determine how you make people feel. Just saying, &ldquo;Hi, how are you?&rdquo; with a gorgeous, fully resonant voice makes people really feel good. Pair it with a smile &amp; they just want to spend more time with you!</p><p> Use direct language. When paired with your gorgeous, warm voice you&rsquo;re not confusing people as &ldquo;beating around the bush&rdquo; does. Be concise.Remove The Underminers like &ldquo;just&rdquo;, &ldquo;actually&rdquo;, &ldquo;honestly&rdquo;, &ldquo;well&rdquo;, filler words, etc. I&rsquo;m not the filler word police. Just don&rsquo;t use too many &amp; when you&rsquo;re making a speech or on an interview try to keep it down to 0 or 1.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Not everyone who goes into sales has their eyes set high up the ladder. <br/>  </h3><p> In fact, because of the commission-based nature of sales positions, climbing up through an organization is not required to earn a high salary or to feel fulfilled in your job. </p><p> However, there are those of us that do have eyes on positions higher up; and it is always a good idea to keep an eye out, even as a passive candidate. Thirty years ago it would be more difficult to pinpoint the skills necessary to become an incredible sales leader.</p><p> However, these days, we have more data than ever to help reverse-engineer what it takes to become great. So how do you do it? This is a typical sales executive career path.</p><h3> Look into higher education <br/>  </h3><p> Bear in mind, there are outliers to every piece of data out there. There will always be that one guy or girl who didn&rsquo;t finish highschool and hustled their way to the top of amillion billion dollar business (*cough cough* Richard Branson). However, statistically, Sales Executives more often than not have at least a Bachelors Degree. Today, even entry level sales jobs often require a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree or some sort of post-secondary education.</p><p> Knowing that sales is something you want to go into can help you narrow down a major.</p><p> Traditionally, Business or Marketing degrees are targeted by employers in general sales positions. However, more and more we are starting to see specialized degrees such as Engineering, Chemistry, or Biology sought after in technology-heavy sales industries. In any case, a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree is a necessary step in the path to becoming Sales Executive (and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to obtain a Master&rsquo;s Degree, too!).</p><h3> Gain experience <br/>  </h3><p> Again, this seems like an obvious step. When you&rsquo;re just starting out you might be tempted to go after any sales position you can get your hands on, simply for the experience factor. However, when you think about the type of industry you want to be in as Sales Executive you should also consider where you need to start.</p><p> When you narrow down your industries of interest, you are giving yourself the opportunity to become very accomplished in an area you are in genuinely excited about.</p><p> It is a well-known fact that salespeople hit their quotas faster and report higher workplace satisfaction when they are working in an industry they love, selling a product the believe in.</p><h3> Keep watch for a Sales Executive position <br/>  </h3><p> As with any other job, you need to be persistent with your job searching. Once you&rsquo;ve put in the time and energy to gain the experience you need to become a Sales Executive, begin applying for positions. These positions may be internally, externally, abroad, remote, with startups or established enterprise companies&hellip; a lot of opportunity here.</p><p> Whatever the position you are going for, be thoughtful and intentional in your search.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t do the classic &ldquo;spray and pray,&rdquo; pitching your resume to any job board you can find. Instead of completing 20 mediocre applications, spend your time on 3 companies you can actually see yourself working at. Your hard work will stand out. Even better, consider using a talent matching service like Ideal Candidate (for salespeople only). With Ideal Candidate you are only required to create one profile, one time. From there, all open roles are matched against your selling style, desired salary and culture fit.</p><h3> Continue learning, and continue studying <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure you become familiar with what a Sales Executive actually does.</p><p> A large part of a sales executive&rsquo;s role is to develop new sales strategies and to anticipate what is going to happen within the market. </p><p> This requires an attention to the market as a whole, so make sure you keep an eye on the industry&rsquo;s news and developments. For example, if you see there has been a major acquisition in your industry, you may want to consider that company as a hot target while they are rebuilding their team.</p><p> InsightSquared has put together a great graphic that summarizes the typical sales career progression. It may be helpful to identify where you fall on the chart below and start thinking of the experience you need to climb the ladder.</p><p> <img alt=\"sales-career-path-ideal-candidate\" src=\"https://www.idealcandidate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sales-career-path-ideal-candidate.png\"/></p><p> Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that this is the only way to get there; but understanding what it takes (education, work experience, etc.) can be extremely helpful as your plan out your short and long term goals.</p><p> Be honest with yourself, keep your eyes on the prize and you will make the right decisions. Good luck out there! </p>",

    "content": "<h3> What's your view on aging and growing older? Most people have negative perceptions about later life stages one that relates it to decline. <br/>  </h3><p> Geriatricians and other professionals tell us, \"Just because you're over the age of 60 don't mean you have to sit it out.\" As a matter of fact, if you want to live a long, healthy life, one must be active, eat nutritious foods, connect with others, and have a positive outlook. </p><p> The Aging Council at  <u>  Seniorcare.com </u>  offers ways to increase longevity. Here are a few \"healthy\" protocols, if followed, will help you live longer but not in a way that's tedious:</p><h3> <strong>  Meditate </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Mindful meditation improves the body and the soul. Research indicates that regular meditation (3 times week) slows brain atrophy as well as decreases stress levels. The calming effect of meditation and relaxation has a positive impact on sleep and improves emotional stability. Patty Grace,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.homehelpersphilly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Home Helpers of Philadelphia  </a> </u> .</p><p> Spirit: Manage your stress, think young, set personal and career goals, be spiritual and develop a sense of purpose and community, and spend time with friends and family who won't judge or criticize. -- Ben Mandelbaum,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.senior-planning.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Senior-Planning.com  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Social connections </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you are an introvert, extrovert, or a blend of both, research shows having social connections pay off in better brain health and quality of life. In every class or talk, I encourage attendees to look at ways to expand their social circle. Online or offline the goal is to build continually personal relationships. -- Judi Bonilla,  <u>  <a href=\"http://judibonilla.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Aging Expert  </a> </u> .</p><p> Adopt technologies that create a social connectivity with other seniors, family members and the communities you live in to reduce loneliness, isolation and create a purpose in life. -- Mike Radice,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.chartacares.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chartacares  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Exercise </strong></h3><p> <br/> Most understand that physical activity will increase longevity, but people don't do it. Not just cardio, but strength training. Hiring a personal trainer for weight training or attending Pilates to strengthen major muscle groups have shown to reduce disease and prevent accidents as we age. -- Nikki Buckelew,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.seniorsrealestateinstitute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Senior Real Estate Solutions  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Yoga </strong></h3><p> <br/> I practice hot flow yoga four days a week and believe that it will increase my average life expectancy. Yoga has dramatically improved my flexibility and core strength which will minimize the risk of falls which cause significant problems for seniors. Yoga also enhances my peace of mind and lowers my blood pressure, both of which are conducive to increase life expectancy. I would recommend a healthy yoga practice to anyone. -- Ted Teele,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www1.touchtown.us/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Touchtown  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  Be happy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Work on traits such as conscientiousness and openness; they relate to happiness in old age. Conversely, and as one might expect, neurotic and anxious individuals are less healthy. The formula to long life, based on recent studies, appears to include healthy living and the ability to cope with stress. Yoga and meditation are certainly beneficial in reducing stress. --  Evan Farr,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.farrlawfirm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Elder Law Expert  </a> </u> .</p>",

Clearly define the &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; that you want prospects to know about your firm (i.e. our team sets us apart).</p><p> 2. Your messaging needs to be concise and compelling describing who you are, what you do, and why someone should work with you.</p><p> 3. Speak to your potential ideal client directly by focusing on your highest common denominator client on your website, not everyone. Your ideal client only wants to know that you can work with them (i.e. don&rsquo;t say we work with individuals, families, and businesses doing xyz &ndash; it is not compelling to anyone).</p><p> 4. Get your website visitor to do something (i.e. have a way for a visitor to watch a video, download an interesting report, sign up for a series of videos, an event, or your e-newsletter).</p><p> 5. Make sure your bios are interesting with a narrative about each person, not just a laundry list of what they do. Connecting happens on a personal level (i.e. the first paragraph of a bio should answer the question, &ldquo;Why are you in this business?&rdquo;).</p><p> 6. Drive people back to your site with frequent updates of your calls to action. Use email and social media to drive people back to your blog or new videos, consistently.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Ever wonder why winners always seem to win? <br/>  </h3><p> You might think it&rsquo;s because they have talent or are lucky. It&rsquo;s not.</p><p> I think talent is extremely overrated next to a great, smart work ethic. I&rsquo;m also certain that&mdash;as someone who&rsquo;s reading this&mdash;you&rsquo;ve heard many &ldquo;definitions&rdquo; of the word luck. I&rsquo;ve actually created my very own (that I&rsquo;m guessing you haven&rsquo;t heard):</p><p> Luck. Noun. (ˈlək). Working tirelessly behind the scenes before appearing for the final act to deliver magical results; typically viewed by an audience who watches in amazement questioning why they can&rsquo;t achieve the same simply by attending the show.</p><p> Maybe you agree. Perhaps not. One thing I know for certain is that attitude, outlook, and effort have far more to do with happiness and success than talent, gifts, or whatever other biological, inheritable, or divine interventions you can imagine.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s take a &ldquo;He Said/She Said&rdquo; look at the different thoughts of winners and losers.</p><h3> ​The Lawn <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;Wow. My neighbor&rsquo;s grass is so much greener than mine.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;My neighbor&rsquo;s grass is really nice and green. I&rsquo;m happy for him. I&rsquo;m guessing if I fertilize and water mine, it&rsquo;ll be greener. I must have just neglected it for a while.&rdquo;</p><h3> I Can&rsquo;t Get No&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;She better give me that otherwise I won&rsquo;t be satisfied.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe how much I already have. I&rsquo;m so satisfied.&rdquo;</p><h3> Honey, Have You Seen My Map? <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m 37 years old and this is as far as I&rsquo;ve gotten in my life.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve accomplished so much and I&rsquo;m only 37 years old. I can&rsquo;t believe how far I&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p><h3> Where&rsquo;s the Starting Line for the Rat Race? <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be as good as she is.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find the one thing that I do best. The one thing where I&rsquo;m so far out in front no one can even see me. I&rsquo;ll just do that.&rdquo;</p><h3> I Flunked Math&mdash;Especially That Pesky Addition and Subtraction <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe what I have (left).&rdquo;</p><h3> Can Someone Please Hand Me My Rose-Colored Glasses? <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;What a horrible experience.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;Wow. I can&rsquo;t believe how much I just learned from that experience.&rdquo;</p><h3> Have You Ever Seen the Inside of a Healthclub? <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;Struggling stinks.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe how strong I&rsquo;ll be once I get through these struggles. Keep pushing.&rdquo;</p><h3> Whoever Said &ldquo;Failure is Not an Option&rdquo; Never Achieved Anything! <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a failure.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;failure.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m always producing results of some kind.&rdquo;</p><h3> I Was a Fortuneteller in Another Life. <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably lose.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;No matter what the scoreboard says, I won (something).&rdquo;</p><h3> No. I Really Was a Fortuneteller.</h3><p> <br/> Loser: &ldquo;I just knew it wouldn&rsquo;t turn out right.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;Huh? My expectations must have been based on faulty information or assumptions. That was a great experience even though it didn&rsquo;t turn out like I thought it would.&rdquo;</p><h3> Did Someone Remove the High Wire Net? <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;Nothing better go wrong.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;My backup plans have backup plans.&rdquo;</p><h3> Have You Seen What Happens to a Superball When You Bounce It? <br/>  </h3><p> Loser: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to get up after that fall.&rdquo; Winner: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that can keep me from getting back up. Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michael_venuto\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Michael Venuto  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.torosoinv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Toroso Investments  </u> </a></p><h3> The growth of smart-beta strategies has been staggering, but quite top heavy.</h3><p> <br/> Meaning, most assets have flowed to factor-based strategies and dividends. I have written in the past about a subcategory of smart beta that I call  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/sections/etf-strategist-corner/complete-core-specialty-etfs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   characteristic indexes  </u>  . </a>  These indexes highlight a business characteristic that active investors often seek through a passive vehicle.</p><p> Many of the ETFs that follow these indexes are categorized by ETF.com as  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/etf-lists/alpha-seeking-etfs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Alpha-Seeking  </u>  .&rdquo; </a> These ETFs allow investors to access buy-backs, spin-offs or IPOs in a low-cost, tax-efficient manner.</p><p> The top-performing &ldquo;alpha-seeking&rdquo; ETF for the past two years has been the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/KNOW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF (KNOW | B-77)  </a> </u> . KNOW remains my current top pick for &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; or &ldquo;alpha seeking&rdquo; ETF, and here is why:</p><h3> <strong>  Why KNOW? </strong></h3><p> <br/> I started due diligence on KNOW with the index data because, like most smart-beta concepts, live ETF data was not available during 2008. This analysis begins by evaluating the Sabrient Multi-cap Inside/Analyst Quant-Weighted Index (SBRQAM), a business characteristic index that investors can obtain exposure to through KNOW.</p><p> The index incorporates four key business characteristics:</p><li> Aggressive accounting practices</li><li> Corporate insiders&rsquo; behavior</li><li> Analysts&rsquo; earnings revisions</li><li> A defensive overlay <br/>  </li><p> The process, simplified, is as follows:</p><h3> <strong>  Step 1 &ndash; Forensic Accounting Component: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Starting with the 1,500 stocks of the S&amp;P Composite 1500, eliminate stocks of companies with very aggressive accounting practices, as identified by Sabrient&rsquo;s proprietary forensic accounting methodology.</p><h3> <strong>  Step 2 &ndash; Insider &amp; Earnings Revisions Component: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Four quantitative factors are used to rank and winnow the remaining stocks after Step 1. At least one of these four factors must be positive for a stock to make this cut:</p><li> Number of insiders making open-market purchases</li><li> Percent increase in the holdings of the purchaser</li><li> Number of positive analyst revisions</li><li> Percent increase in analyst expectations <br/>  </li><p> A quantitative overlay ranks the stocks from the first cut to 600 using a forward-looking &ldquo;outlook score.&rdquo; This score rewards strong historical and projected growth trends, low current and projected valuation, high quality of earnings, and favorable dynamics of Wall Street analyst estimates. The top 100 stocks from this second cut are used to populate the index.</p><h3> <strong>  Step 3 &ndash; Defensive Component: </strong></h3><p> <br/> A &ldquo;defensive sentiment&rdquo; overlay is used to rank the final 100 stocks. This overlay rewards stocks that historically have performed well in weak markets and have strong free cash-flow yield and strong dividend yield.</p><p> The top 50 stocks are then weighted exponentially so that the top 50 represent a range of 2.67% (for the highest-ranked stock) to 0.96% for the 50th-ranked stock, and each of the bottom 50 stocks is given a flat weighting of 0.35% in SBRQAM.</p><h3> <strong>  Comparing Indexes </strong></h3><p> <br/> I have selected three broad-based market-weighted indexes as comparison for SBRQAM. Our goal in performing this comparison is twofold:</p><li> Assess the effectiveness of SBRQAM&rsquo;s stock selection process relative to an investment in a broad-based market-cap-weighted index. For this analysis, we will compare SBRQAM to the S&amp;P Composite 1500.</li><li> See whether SBRQAM could work as a &ldquo;core enhancer&rdquo; to two indexes, where the ETFs linked to the index represents substantial assets. <br/>  </li><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-30-at-5.26.07-AM.png\" width=\"668\"/></p><p> The S&amp;P 1500 Index and SBRQAM start from the same universe of stocks. The S&amp;P 1500 ranks all of the constituents by market cap, whereas SBRQAM follows the ranking and winnowing process described above. Security Selection</p><p> The question is, how well does this security selection process actually work? Below are some key charts to help understand the differences:</p><p> View gallery</p>.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/het3NFAekUY0NDHUBPcHzA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTg1/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/indexuniverse.com/ba08ab074b232995f55bd395980d0b53\"/><p> <br/> The chart above shows that an investment of $100 would have grown to over $434 since Jan. 1, 2002 if invested in the SBRQAM Index; whereas an investment of $100 in the S&amp;P Composite 1500 for the same time period would have only returned $188.</p><h3> <strong>  How Costs Figure In </strong></h3><p> <br/> Both of these calculations measure the change in prices of the underlying holdings and do not take into account the additional costs of investing. However, for the SBRQAM Index, I reduced the price returns by 65 basis points per year to represent the imputed cost of the KNOW ETF (this also applies to the next two charts below).</p><p> The relative statistics over the last three, five and 10 years, presented in the chart below, show that the SBRQAM Index can enhance the return of a core investment in a market-capitalization-weighted index. The resulting returns are compelling enough to consider an allocation to an ETF tied to SBRQAM, even though SBRQAM has a higher beta than the benchmark index.</p><p> View gallery</p>.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/_Gt0WeGv_x51I8oAqCAHvw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTg1/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/indexuniverse.com/586e6815f8adb49fd7bc33586faa6192\"/><p> <br/> I firmly believe investing in a product such as KNOW that follows the SBRQAM Index creates an opportunity to enhance portfolio returns. The chart below shows returns were stronger in the last seven calendar years. This helps draw the conclusion that it may work well with a core market fund and may provide excess returns over time. However, we should not rely on past performance history alone.</p><p> View gallery</p>.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/DeNGILO.P0ZbKqCbma4DtQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTg1/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/indexuniverse.com/67b97be4ff40d84b48f4316e91035c64\"/><p> <br/> So, from this point, my due diligence process digs into the fundamentals of the ETF to make sure it improves the overall fundamentals of the portfolio. In my opinion, if the underlying fundamentals are not better, then the likelihood of enhancing returns is diminished.</p><p> For here, I look to widely held ETFs that are often used as a core investment to represent the overall market&mdash;the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/SPY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY | A-98  </a>  ), </u> the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/VTI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI | A-100)  </a> </u>  and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.etf.com/ITOT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market (ITOT | A-100  </a> </u> ). The next chart compares the fundamentals of KNOW to three ETFs as of Dec. 31, 2015:</p><p> View gallery</p>.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/iekwjtpK6oLV_6KflE827w--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTg1/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/indexuniverse.com/cc8da45f42d93a836b6fa54375072568\"/><p> <br/> This shows that KNOW seems to have the opportunity to grow more than the broad-based market-cap-weighted ETFs when you look at the price to sales and price to book ratios.</p><p> The price to earnings is in line with SPY, and lower than the other corresponding ETFs, although this ratio is subject to a higher-degree accounting judgment when posting a company&rsquo;s earnings. Price relative to sales and book value have a lower opportunity for such judgments. They may present a more reliable picture of the fundamentals. KNOW also has the highest yield compared with these ETFs.</p><h3> <strong>  Overlap </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investors should ask themselves, if the correlations are so high, why has KNOW outperformed these other benchmark ETFs? Evaluate the overlap.</p><p> We define &ldquo;overlap&rdquo; as the percentage of the ETF that is contained or represented by an ETF to which it is being compared. There is a 12% overlap between KNOW and SPY, an 11% overlap between KNOW and VTI, and an 11% overlap between KNOW and ITOT. The index methodology behind SRQAM and KNOW has systematically chosen securities that have a high correlation to traditional indexing with a portfolio that is 88% different.</p><p> In the world of active management, the phenomenon of high correlation and low overlap is called &ldquo;positive active-share.&rdquo; This high level of active-share could explain the large positive performance divergence relative to these widely used broad-based ETFs.</p><h3> <strong>  Tax Efficiency </strong></h3><p> <br/> One of the key benefits of business-characteristic ETFs is their tax efficiency. According to Morningstar, the annualized turnover of KNOW is 827%, which would generally result in significant capital gains distributions to shareholders of a mutual fund.</p><p> However, the unique ability of an ETF to create and redeem shares allows for the distributed capital gains to be minimized significantly. So far, KNOW has distributed capital gains only in one year&mdash;2012&mdash;when it distributed $1.54 in short-term gains, or about 3%. No capital gains were distributed in 2013, 2014 or 2015.</p><h3> <strong>  The Bottom Line </strong></h3><p> <br/> As noted on ETF.com, KNOW has been the best-performing &ldquo;alpha seeking&rdquo; ETF for two years, and there is evidence to suggest this positive relative performance can continue. The fundamentals of KNOW, relative to certain broad-based market-cap-weighted ETFs, and are generally considered a better investment opportunity to the &ldquo;growth at a reasonable price&rdquo; investor.</p><p> The high level of active-share generated by the SBQAM Index makes KNOW an attractive ETF for diversifying core U.S. equity exposure. The tax efficiency of the ETF allow the investor to retain exposure to a series of companies that meet its selection criteria and avoid massive capital gains as the fund holdings turns over. With this ETF, I intend to &ldquo;stay in the know.&rdquo;</p>",

    "content": "<p> We were saddened last week to hear that at least 30 people were killed and many dozens more injured in ISIS-related suicide bombings that targeted an airport and train station in Brussels. The Belgian and European Union capital joins Paris, San Bernardino, Ankara, Jakarta and too many other cities in the past year alone that have come under fire from the Islamic terrorist group.</p><p> I was in Brussels most recently three years ago for an International Crisis Group meeting, and I was stunned by its beauty and elegance, highlighted with gold-trimmed architecture and vibrant flowers. In August, the city will celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Flower Carpet, which makes jaw-dropping use of over 600,000 begonias.</p><h3> This artistry stands in stark contrast to the cowardice and brutality we saw last week.</h3><p> <br/> While we can&rsquo;t leave aside the immeasurable loss of life, tragic events such as these tend to have an enormous ripple effect on the economy. Between 70 and 80 percent of the European economy is based on consumption, and when people&rsquo;s sense of safety and security ends up being rattled, they might temporarily avoid spending on travel and at malls, cinemas, restaurants and elsewhere.</p><p> I definitely saw this to be the case in the days following the 9/11 attacks. As I&rsquo;ve shared with you before, I was in Manhattan at the time, attending a financial industry conference. Except for emergency services, all of New York City shut down in every way imaginable, from subways to airports to cell phones. (Because I had a San Antonio area code, I could still make calls on my phone.) I was lucky enough to reserve one of the last available rental cars in the area, and on the long drive home to Texas, I passed many stores and businesses that had closed for the week.</p><p> Indeed, few things are as disruptive to our lives and the economy as terrorist activity. A recent Gallup poll found that 79 percent of respondents believe global terrorism to be a &ldquo;critical threat&rdquo; to the U.S., the highest of any other potential threat.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-24/COMM-americans-believe-international-terrorism-poses-most-critical-threat-to-the-us-03242016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Americans Believe International Terrorism Poses Most Critial Threat to the U.S.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-24/COMM-americans-believe-international-terrorism-poses-most-critical-threat-to-the-us-03242016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> What&rsquo;s more, the economic impact of global terrorism has been rising steadily since 2010. In November, the Institute of Economics and Peace (IEP) calculated its cost at over $52 billion in 2014, the highest ever.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-24/COMM-global-cost-terrorism-hit-all-time-high-in-2014-03242016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Global Cost of Terrorism Hit an All-Time High in 2014\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-24/COMM-global-cost-terrorism-hit-all-time-high-in-2014-03242016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> But this figure takes into account only direct, short-term costs. The 9/11 attacks were initially estimated to have cost $27.2 billion, but when you factor in indirect and long-term expenditures&mdash;the economic impact, war funding, future veterans&rsquo; care and more&mdash;it comes closer to  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/09/08/us/sept-11-reckoning/cost-graphic.html?_r=1&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   $3.3 trillion  </u>  , </a>  according to the New York Times.</p><p> So who are the beneficiaries in the aftermath of such disruptive events? Following the  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/what-were-paying-attention-to-following-the-paris-attacks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Paris attacks in November  </u>  , </a>  aerospace and defense stocks such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman got a boost.</p><p> Very often, governments use terrorist attacks to usurp individual rights and chip away at democracy. Little more than a month after 9/11, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which was vehemently criticized for violating people&rsquo;s privacy.</p><p> Similarly, one of the biggest consequences of the Brussels attack might very well end up being political. Fueled by the Syrian migrant crisis, far-right parties and nationalist movements have already been gaining ground in Europe&mdash;the Alternative for Germany party, the National Front in France, the Danish People&rsquo;s Party&mdash;and Brussels will likely serve as an impetus for further change.</p><p> The attacks also highlight the importance of owning gold, which investors have traditionally valued for its stability in times of crisis and currency fluctuations. Lately we&rsquo;ve seen central banks all over the globe respond to lackluster growth with subzero rate polices, and this could accelerate if terrorist activity continues to shock our economies.</p><p> The yellow metal is currently up more than 15 percent since the beginning of 2016, making it one of the best performing assets of the year. Over the same time, inflows into gold ETFs have surged 20.3 percent. Earlier this month I shared with you  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/to-jumpstart-its-economy-china-embraces-reaganomics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   an observation from Pierre Lassonde  </u>  , </a>  cofounder of Franco-Nevada, who told me that for every $1 billion that goes into the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the price of gold rises approximately $30 per ounce.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-24/COMM-gold-etf-holdings-surge-20-percent-year-to-date-03242016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold ETF Holdings Surbe 20.3 Percent Year-to-Date\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-03-24/COMM-gold-etf-holdings-surge-20-percent-year-to-date-03242016.png\"/>  <br/>  <u>   click to enlarge  </u> </a></p><p> I recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold&mdash;5 percent in gold stocks, the other 5 percent in physical bars, coins and jewelry&mdash;in both good times and bad.</p><h3> Tony Blair: Time to Put an End to &ldquo;Flabby Liberalism&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Even though Mr. Blair&mdash;whom I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting several times&mdash;was speaking of European politics in general, British in particular, I believe his advice should be heeded by all Western governments. Somehow we&rsquo;ve gotten it in our heads that we should feel guilty for our beliefs and way of life. In Blair&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t let people intimidate us into thinking there are certain values we shouldn&rsquo;t be standing up for&rdquo;&mdash;values such as freedom, personal liberty, capitalism and entrepreneurship. Speaking ahead of the Brussels attack, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that  <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3504303/Tony-Blair-says-flabby-liberalism-helping-terrorists-elite-feel-guilty-extremists.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   flabby liberalism  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  has helped cultivate an environment in which radical Islam can grow and, worse, be tolerated. A more assertive policy of &ldquo;muscular centrism&rdquo; is needed, he argued.</p><p> It&rsquo;s these very values that have attracted some of the world&rsquo;s greatest minds to the U.S.  </p><p> Grove, born Andr&aacute;s Gr&oacute;f, was named Time&rsquo;s Man of the Year in 1997. His 1999 book  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Only-Paranoid-Survive-Exploit-Challenge/dp/0385483821\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   Only the Paranoid Survive  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  is a seminal work on how computer technology has fundamentally changed business and led to new strategic inflection points. Consider the life story of Andrew Grove, the Hungarian-born Jew who went on to become CEO of chipmaker Intel and the man who&rsquo;s widely credited for building Silicon Valley into the tech mecca it is today. Grove, who passed away last week at the age of 79, grew up behind the Iron Curtain in a country that, at the time, knew nothing of individual rights or personal and intellectual property. Had he stayed, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely the world would have seen or benefited from the startling advancements in personal computing that came as a direct result of his involvement in memory chips and microprocessors. Fortunately for us, he managed to flee to the U.S., where he found the opportunity to pursue, develop and be rewarded for his talents.</p><p> A similar story can be told of Ern? Rubik, inventor of the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, who was also born a Jew in Soviet-era Hungary. An architect by trade, Rubik originally conceived of his now-famous toy in 1974 but couldn&rsquo;t get a patent on it until 1977. His options were very limited for manufacturing and marketing, and even once he was able to get his creation on store shelves, he received little credit or reward because communist and socialist countries don&rsquo;t respect property of any kind, including intellectual property.</p><p> Like Grove, Rubik owes much of his success to the values of freedom, capitalism and intellectual property. We should acknowledge and celebrate them, not apologize for them. The 3D puzzle game attracted hardly any attention until it was discovered in 1979 by a Hungarian expatriate who owned a games and toys company in England. A deal was negotiated with an American toy company, and Rubik&rsquo;s invention, renamed the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, went on to become one of the most sought-after toys of the 1980s. Today, an estimated 350 million units have been sold worldwide.</p><h3> Tax-Free, Stress-Free Income</h3><p> <br/> Whether from terror or disease or hurricanes, volatility is a fact of life. What&rsquo;s important is to have balance, from the food we eat to the activities we engage in to what we put in our portfolios. As such, we need calm investing, which can offset this volatility with quiet, modest growth.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently talked about the oncoming internet developments that follow the internet of things, from the internet on demand (3D and 4D printing) to the internet of robots.  A colleague came up afterwards, and said I was daft to talk about robots.  It&rsquo;s science fiction he claimed.  I disagreed as science fiction is rapidly becoming  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/23/dominos-robot-delivery/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fact  </a> </u> .</p><p> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robot-1.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Robot\" src=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robot-1.jpg?3226c1\"/> </a></p><p> I was reminded of this whilst listening to some guy called Brett King talking about his new book  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Augmented-Life-Smart-Brett-King/dp/9814634034/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Augmented  </a> </u>  at the MEFTECH conference this week. The book is all about robots, artificial intelligence, nanotechnologies and such like.  The key in this area of development is that we will reach a stage soon where man and machine are hard to separate.  For example, there&rsquo;s a moment in the excellent series  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Humans  </a> </u> , where the human police inspector tells his robot colleague &ndash; they call them synths, as in synthetic humans &ndash; about having a heart implant machine that tracks his heartbeat after having a heart attack the year before.  As he concludes this speech, he says:</p><p> &ldquo;So you see, there&rsquo;s a little bit of machine inside the human, just as there&rsquo;s a little bit of the human inside the machine&rdquo;</p><p> The man-machine discussion has been one we have had since the age of media &ndash; just look at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Metropolis  </a> </u> .  </p><p> <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Metropolis.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Metropolis\" src=\"http://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Metropolis-1024x640.jpg?3226c1\"/> </a></p><p> During the series Humans, there&rsquo;s a moment where the husband of the main family portrayed in the show overrides the synthetic&rsquo;s censorship levels in order to pleasure himself.  His wife finds out from the record on the robot&rsquo;s maintenance system, and a huge row ensues.  This made me think about the predictions that are out there, with Ray Kurzweil&rsquo;s probably resounding most loudly  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/11/computers-will-be-like-humans-by-2029-googles-ray-kurzweil.html\" target=\"_blank\">   in my ears  </a> </u> :</p><p> In less than two decades, you won&rsquo;t just use your computers, you will have relationships with them.  Because of artificial intelligence, computers will be able to read at human levels by 2029 and will also begin to have different human characteristics, said Ray Kurzweil, a director of engineering at Google.  &ldquo;My timeline is computers will be at human levels, such as you can have a human relationship with them, 15 years from now,&rdquo; he said. Kurzweil&rsquo;s comments came at the Exponential Finance conference in New York on Wednesday.  &ldquo;When I say about human levels, I&rsquo;m talking about emotional intelligence. The ability to tell a joke, to be funny, to be romantic, to be loving, to be sexy, that is the cutting edge of human intelligence, that is not a sideshow.&rdquo;</p><p> By 2030, we will be making love with robots!</p><p> That&rsquo;s one idea anyway.  Now add another idea into the mix:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-79711/We-create-babies-men-claim-scientists.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   We can create babies without men, claim scientists  </a> </u> .</p><p> In other words by 2030, we can have relationships with robots and have a baby with them, created in a beaker in the lab with sperm made from stem cells.  We will no longer need to have a human partner, with their idiosyncrasies and irritations.  We can have the perfect relationship with someone who learns our every nuance, wish and desire, and is dedicated to serving our needs.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s all this got to do with banking.  </h3><p> <br/> Well, did you hear that  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/japanese-bank-introduces-robot-workers-to-deal-with-customers-in-branches\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Japanese banks  </a> </u>  are replacing tellers with robots? I thought British banks had done the same thing, and then discovered my teller was a human after all.   <strong>  Who said science fiction does not become science fact over time? </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> We continue our discussion of The BEI's Seven Step Exit Planning Process TM  with this article for those who want to explore a transfer to insiders.</h3>We kicked off this series with a comparison of Exit Planning and<a href=\"/exit-planning/succession-planning-and-exit-planning-compare-and-contrast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> succession planning</a> and followed that with <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/exit-planning-begins-with-step-one-set-goals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> setting the owner&rsquo;s goals</a>, the critical importance of <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/how-to-get-the-most-from-your-exit-planning-and-cash-flow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> defining cash flow</a>, <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/exit-planning-process-how-to-build-and-protect-business-value\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> protecting business value</a> and the important issues in a <a href=\"/strategies/exit-planning/client-thinking-of-selling-their-business-dont-let-them-taint-the-marketplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> sale to a third party</a>.When owners tell you that they are considering transferring their companies to insiders (co-owner(s), or one or more key employees) where do you begin? We suggest that you first make a preliminary assessment of whether this path makes sense before you assess the intended successors and an owner&rsquo;s expectations.<h3> 1. Will This Exit Path Meet The Owner&rsquo;s Goals?</h3>We all meet owners ready to head down an exit path (sale to a third party, a transfer to family members or an insider transfer) before they do the work involved in Steps One and Two of the Exit Planning Process. It makes no sense to embark on a path without establishing exit goals, determining business value, cash flow, and knowing the size of the gap between an owner&rsquo;s current and needed-at-exit resources. Without this information, no one can determine whether a transfer to insiders makes sense.<h3> 2. Will The Owner Exchange Time for Risk?</h3>If an owner says he or she wants to exit and transfer ownership immediately, a transfer to children or employees is fraught with risk. These successor/insiders can rarely obtain financing to buy a company. The consequence is that your client ends up carrying a long-term promissory note from the buyers. As an advisor, you must make owners aware of the risks and likelihood of not getting paid using this (non-) strategy. It is also necessary to show them better alternatives.We suggest that you describe and illustrate the benefits of implementing a gradual transfer of ownership that occurs only if the business performs as expected. The benefits to sellers of pushing back a departure date include: 1) continued receipt of cash distributions (usually S distributions) from their businesses, 2) increasing the likelihood of receiving payment, and 3) time to evaluate whether members of the KEG are good candidates for ownership. Transferring increments of ownership over several years and requiring the KEG to meet an ever-increasing performance standard (such as annual increases in company cash flow), is a primary strategy we use.<h3> 3. How Much Risk Can An Owner Stomach?</h3>Transfers to insiders are not at all difficult if owners don't mind depending on key employees, children or other quasi-paupers to successfully run their businesses and pay them in full. Successful transfers, however, are more difficult because they require: 1) proper planning to minimize owner risk, 2) a company that can run without its owner, and 3) an advisor who knows how to structure the transfer.<h3> 4. Has The Owner Made Any Promises?</h3>As the advisor, you must know whether an owner has made any promises of ownership (no matter how vague) to one or more employees. If so, you will have to handle those promises as you design the transfer of ownership.<h3> 5. How Old Are The Intended Successors?</h3>As you look at an owner&rsquo;s intended successor, are any are older than 50? If so, few would-be owners want to spend years acquiring stock only to sell it at retirement (probably via a long-term installment note) at a value not substantially greater than the one they paid. If you know that successors are &ldquo;mature,&rdquo; you may want to consider a phantom stock or stock appreciation rights plan.In our next article, we will discuss the five owner assumptions that you will need to probe.",

    "content": "<h3> My father emigrated from Taiwan in the 1960s with only $17 to his name and the clothes on his back. Even though he was poor in the material and financial sense, he never considered himself poor. <br/>  </h3><p> His mantra was that financial wealth alone did not represent one&rsquo;s &ldquo;true wealth.&rdquo; He stressed the fact that he was rich in spirit and blessed with his education.</p><p> The most valuable financial advice that my dad instilled in me was not to define myself by what I have, but rather by my accomplishments and education. He insisted that while money did not buy happiness, it did provide peace of mind, freedom, and flexibility.</p><p> I learned that money should not be the sole determining factor for the decisions I make in life. His financial wisdom and insight have enabled me to adopt a balanced, holistic approach to financial matters, for which I am eternally grateful.</p><h3> The Circle of Life <br/>  </h3><p> I hope to further my dad&rsquo;s legacy and instill values of financial stewardship and reverence for one&rsquo;s elders. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to meet any of my grandfathers, as they passed away even before my parents got married.</p><p> My three children are fortunate to know my dad, and though he now faces the physical challenges that accompany Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease, my children treat him&mdash;and other individuals with physical limitations&mdash;with patience and compassion.</p><p> True to my dad&rsquo;s advice, I don&rsquo;t define success merely by accomplishing what I desire to achieve.</p><p> As parents, we all aspire to bestow our children with the tools, knowledge, and resources to achieve academic success. I also impart the importance of prudent money management and effective time management.</p><p> My moment of clarity occurred when my eldest daughter Sarina proudly exclaimed, &ldquo;Mom, I realize that if I continue to manage my time and money well, as well as believe in my ability to overcome obstacles and challenges on my own, there&rsquo;s no limit to what I can achieve.&rdquo;</p><p> Financial literacy is the key to economic success.</p><p> Keeping that goal in mind, consider these three money-saving strategies to help teach your children how to best manage their money. They are simple and effective, even for children in elementary school.</p><p> <strong>  1. Create a family financial mission statement </strong></p><p> Solicit input from your family about what each member thinks is important. Is it eating out, taking vacations, saving for college&mdash;or all of these goals? Have an open conversation with your spouse and children to get them thinking about the meaning of money, the challenge of earning it, and importance of saving for what you truly value.</p><p> <strong>  2. Take opportunities in your daily activities to model how you make money decisions </strong></p><p> By discussing money making decisions as you shop, cook, and pay bills, you provide concrete examples that your children can model. Plus, taking the kids to the grocery store and cooking dinner afterwards teaches them to apply their math skills in the real world. Having them bag groceries with you at the check-out shows them how much it really costs to fill up the fridge each week.</p><p> <strong>  3. Allow children firsthand experience in earning, saving, and spending their own money </strong></p><p> Allowances are great&mdash;so long as the kids actually do chores to earn the cash. Be sure to set up a savings account for them early, and let them manage the records so they can see how much money they are saving over the years. By the time they hit their teens, this will be a valuable lesson when it comes to wanting to spend their savings on clothes, food, and friends&mdash;and still save for college. Then, by the time they head off to the university of their dreams, they will be more likely to have a savvy sensibility about managing their expenses. Remember, children need to have the benefit of making their own decisions&mdash;and learning from their mistakes&mdash;so that as adults they are as wise as my dad.</p><p> Try using these simple ideas at home with your kids, and let me know how it goes.</p>",

You have to learn how to win and not run away when you lose.\"</p><h3> Now, what does this have to do with you? <br/>  </h3><p> Our financial advisor clients regularly ask us to review their brochures, letters, campaigns and websites.</p><p> Whether they used our services to develop their material or not, they want us to tell them if we think their copy will &ldquo;work&rdquo;, if it will help them &ldquo;sell&rdquo; themselves or a specific product of service.</p><p> Invariably what we see far too often are &ldquo;me too&rdquo; promotional pieces.</p><p> Sure, the personal pictures are different, the artwork may be great and the copy may be written professionally, yet there is generally little to distinguish the unique value of the advisor (you), to perspective clients.</p><p> You only need to spend about three minutes surfing advisor websites on the internet to see the &ldquo;me too&rdquo; nature of many practices.</p><p> Please understand, these observations are not meant to be overly critical, I&rsquo;ve been there.</p><p> I know from first hand experience that busy financial professionals spend the majority of their time developing and implementing client solutions, not creating marketing material.</p><p> At the same time, to develop a sustainable business, there is a genuine need to develop marketing and promotional content that breeds loyalty, encourages referrals and attracts new relationships.</p><p> &ldquo;There is a genuine need to develop marketing and promotional content that breeds loyalty, encourages referrals and attracts new relationships&hellip;a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; approach will not make the grade&rdquo;</p><h3> A &ldquo;me too&rdquo; approach will not make the grade <br/>  </h3><p> To drive this point home, consider these common advisor rationalizations and the ensuing &ldquo;buts&rdquo; we interject in dialogue over marketing material we&rsquo;re asked to critique:</p><li> Without even seeing my marketing material, my best clients inherently understand my value proposition&hellip;but could they explain it to a potential referral effectively?</li><li> Most casual observers of my brochure are impressed by its quality&hellip;but would it compel them to meet with you to learn more?</li><li> I always win the business when I have the opportunity to personally interview a potential client&hellip;but do your marketing campaigns generate enough leads and appointments?</li><p> Hopefully, none of these circumstances apply to you and your practice&hellip;but if they do, set aside some time to create or update your marketing pieces.</p><p> To begin this process, reflect on the following questions and you will be on your way to clarifying the unique value that keeps you from looking like a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; advisor: </p><h3> 1.  Are you consistent and self-assured? <br/>  </h3><p> When you meet someone for the first time and they ask you what you do for a living, do you respond quickly and with confidence?</p><p> The best advisors we know do not hesitate; whether they deliver a 2 word title or a 2 sentence &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo;, their delivery is consistent and self-assured.</p><p> As you consider your marketing material, ask yourself if you are delivering these same qualities.</p><p> Be both proud of what you do and consistent in the words you use to describe your position.</p><p> An &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; can be a great tool, but falls flat when used inappropriately or without true passion; there is nothing wrong with a simple title.</p><p> From financial advisor to insurance specialist to financial planner to wealth manager, it is not only the words you choose to use, it is the way you choose to use them.</p><p> One of the most successful wealth managers I know has introduced himself as a &ldquo;stockbroker&rdquo; for more than 20 years even though his business has evolved dramatically.</p><p> Each time he makes an introduction, his poise elicits a curiosity that allows him to take the conversation wherever he chooses.</p><p> Develop this sense of pride in both your spoken and written words.</p><h3> 2.  Do your value statements speak about you or how you &ldquo;solve the needs&rdquo; of individuals or organizations in your niche market? <br/>  </h3><p> Much of the &ldquo;me too&rdquo; terminology we see comes in the way many marketing pieces are all about the background, experience and standing of an advisor and their firm.</p><p> Though relevant, this information is all features and no benefits.</p><p> No matter how clever you may be in describing yourself, often times background information all looks the same to your target audience.</p><p> As you consider your marketing approach, regularly ask yourself if your language speaks to solving the specific needs of your niche market.</p><p> Your audience is not looking for a typical resume.</p><p> The more personally they can identify with the benefits of a relationship with you, the more effective your campaigns will be.</p><h3> 3.  Does your marketing material clearly explain &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; in your client management process? <br/>  </h3><p> Whether you are a financial planner, retirement planning specialist or an investment manager, you should have a distinct client management process.</p><p> In other words, a series of ongoing activities that allow you to establish, manage, monitor and maintain long-term relationships.</p><p> Your marketing pieces should communicate these steps to clients and prospects.</p><p> This helps the viewer of your material understand their &ldquo;next step&rdquo; if they choose to follow through on your brochure, sales letter or website.</p><h3> Clarity of purpose eliminates unnecessary surprises <br/>  </h3><p> Clarity of purpose eliminates unnecessary surprises.</p><p> For example, if a client is new to your practice they should know the first order of business is a discovery meeting.</p><p> On the other hand if you are introducing a new service to an existing client there should be no doubt you have done your homework on both the client and the offering before beginning your approach.</p><p> Although not a comprehensive list, these questions should help you get started in reviewing current marketing material or developing new pieces.</p><p> Your brochures, sales letters, newsletters and website should each stand up to this simple examination.</p><p> Since you&rsquo;ve read this far, you probably realize by now that what you may perceive as weaknesses could very well become your greatest strengths.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> We have tons of data. But do we understand what it's telling us, what it means? <br/>  </h3><p> Knowledge without understanding is useless. <br/> <br/> You've heard me write/say it before: You can't transform something you don't understand. <br/> <br/> Do you understand your customers' needs, expectations, the jobs they're trying to do, and their desired outcomes? <br/> <br/> There are really three ways to achieve that understanding. There may be more, but I tend to focus on these three. I'll review them in a second, but the problem with these approaches (or any others) is that, if not done correctly, you'll be no further ahead in terms of understanding than if you hadn't done them.</p><h3> The three approaches are: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Listen. </strong> Don't just ask customers about the experience, listen, as well. There are a lot of different channels and ways for customers to tell you about their needs and desired outcomes and how well you are performing against their expectations. Understanding these expectations and identifying key drivers of a great customer experience are important outcomes of this exercise.</p><p> <strong>  2. Characterize. </strong> Research your customers. Identify the jobs they are trying to do. Compile key personas that represent the various types of prospects and customers that (might) buy from you or that use your products or services.</p><p> <strong>  3. Empathize. </strong> Walk in your customers' shoes to get a clear understanding of the steps they take to do whatever job it is they are trying to do with your organization.  Map their journeys to understand the current state of the experience.</p><p> These are all learning exercises, critical learning exercises. We walk away from them with a lot of knowledge about customers, but we need to make sure we truly understand what we've heard about customers, their needs, and their expectations. Without that understanding, the exercises have failed. Make sure they're done right.</p><h3> A couple tips... <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  When you listen, ask the right questions at the right time of the right audience to elicit the feedback you need to understand what's going right and what isn't. And then do something with it. </p></li><li> <p>  When you characterize, ensure that the research is rooted in the right data, i.e., relevant prospect and customer data and interviews. </p></li><li> <p>  And when you empathize, when you walk in your customer's shoes to understand his experience, you need to make sure you capture the experience from his viewpoint because creating from yours defeats the purpose of this process. And then fix what's wrong. </p></li><p> To wrap up today's post, I thought I'd share some insightful quotes about understanding, with the first one really hitting home for that last bullet point. <br/> <br/> \"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.\" <strong>  - Harper Lee  </strong> <br/> <br/> \"Understanding human needs is half the job of meeting them.\"  <strong>  - Adlai E Jr Stevenson </strong> <br/> <br/> \"Understanding\" is much deeper than \"knowledge.\" There are many people who know us, but very few who understand us.\"  <strong>  - Author unknown </strong> <br/> <br/> \"It is understanding that gives us an ability to have peace. When we understand the other fellow's viewpoint, and he understands ours, then we can sit down and work out our differences.\"  <strong>  - Harry S. Truman </strong> <br/> <br/> \"There is a great difference between knowing and understanding: you can know a lot about something and not really understand it.\"  <strong>  - Charles F. Kettering </strong> <br/> <br/> \"If you want the people to understand you, invite them to your life and let them see the world from your window!\"  <strong>  - Mehmet Murat ildan </strong> <br/> <br/> \"Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't so.\" <strong>  - Lemony Snicket  </strong> <br/> <br/> \"Those who know, do. Those who understand, teach.\" <strong>  - Aristotle </strong> <br/> <br/> \"Any fool can know. The point is to understand.\"  <strong>  - Albert Einstein </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;re a small company or a rising start-up, you need to attract top talent without breaking the bank. </p><p> Check out these recruitment strategies to make yourself attractive to prized candidates &mdash; that have nothing to do with salary.</p><h3> Give Employees a Stake in the Company <br/>  </h3><p> Sure, there&rsquo;s the glitz and glam of stories like how a former Google masseuse went on to become a millionaire by cashing in her stock options. But even outside of these spectacular scenarios, giving employees shares in the company is a wonderful gift that&rsquo;s twofold. One, it lets the employee know that you want them to be a part of your company&rsquo;s family, and that you&rsquo;re willing to invest in them to make this happen. Two, it provides them an incentive to make sure your company succeeds, since as it continues to climb, so do their shares.</p><h3> Offer a Competitive Benefits Package <br/>  </h3><p> According to a 2012 article from Entrepreneur, 90% of employees in a survey said that health insurance was the most important benefit. No wonder &mdash; it&rsquo;s expensive! Yet with many health plans to choose from on the market, finding one that fits your company&rsquo;s size and needs is less daunting than it seems.</p><p> Flexible schedules are also in high demand, and this is great news. While they don&rsquo;t have to cost you a cent, they help employees achieve a much better work-life balance while showing that you trust them to be adults.</p><h3> Show That You Want Them <br/>  </h3><p> Something that is easily overlooked by employers &mdash; but is nonetheless incredibly important &mdash; is making sure you treat your recruits with respect. Things like sending personalized invites and small gifts to highly qualified recruits can be enough to win employees over. Getting paid is important, but knowing that you truly value them and what they bring to the table is a reward that money can&rsquo;t buy.</p><h3> Inspire Them With Your Company Culture <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s important for people to enjoy the work they do, and a tremendous part of that comes with what the office environment is like each day. If your company has a great personality, show it off. Make sure your &ldquo;Careers&rdquo; page separates you from the crowd by putting up videos, blog posts, and showing off your unique character. Demonstrate to your dream candidates why this is a place that they want to work.</p><h3> Wow Them With the Company Vision <br/>  </h3><p> You know where you&rsquo;re going and what you need to do to get there. You have grand aspirations for your company. Share them with your future employees. Make sure your mission page is updated with the relevant content describing what you aim to accomplish and the philosophy behind what you do. Give your recruits access to the personal touches that will inspire them to adopt your vision and invest in helping to make it a reality.</p><p> A survey by Cap Strat found that 72% of millennials, the largest generation in the U.S., are willing to forgo a higher salary for a more fulfilling career. What this says about today&rsquo;s workforce is clear.</p><p> With the right combination of benefits and organizational philosophies in place, smaller companies have everything they need to recruit the employees they want without being forced to break the bank.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> As active participants of life, as doers and shakers, as people who want to make a difference, we are busy. <br/>  </h3><p> But like anything in our world that gets out of balance, working without rest can lead to consequences that negate the positive results of our work.</p><p> Bob Kull, author of  SOLITUDE: Seeking Wisdom in Extremes , wrote: \"We tend to value activity above everything else, but all beings need to rest and recuperate. The widespread occurrence of depression in our culture may be linked to our refusal to allow ourselves quiet time. Feeling the need to be constantly busy can prevent us from turning inward. When we are out of balance, our activity doesn&rsquo;t arise from a place of stillness and wisdom.\" </p><p> Solitude, especially in our society today, is not a luxury or an activity we pencil in on calendars. It is a need.</p><p> The benefits of solitude should propel it to a list topper of our priorities.</p><h3> 5 Benefits to Solitude <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Rebooting the brain <br/>  </h3><p> Being &ldquo;on&rdquo; or even working diligently doesn&rsquo;t allow your mind a chance to turn off and rest.</p><p> Even when you are watching a movie, your brain is working to listen actively and follow the story. But when you are alone and without any distractions, your brain can recharge.</p><h3> 2. Working through problems <br/>  </h3><p> When you sit with a friend and talk, your mind is engaging in your friend&rsquo;s world as well as yours. It may be an effective way to process your problems and emotions, but to find a solution and come to peace with it requires solitude.</p><h3> 3. Finding your voice <br/>  </h3><p> When you are with people, it is easy to blend your voice with theirs and come to group thoughts and decisions. The influence of others is inevitable. But when you are in solitude, the noises are gone and you are able to hear what you truly want to say and believe.</p><h3> 4. Improving your relationships <br/>  </h3><p> In spending time alone and seeking to understand yourself better, you become a better wife, friend, boss. You will also find yourself appreciating your loved ones more after some quiet time in reflection.</p><h3> 5. Satisfying your own needs <br/>  </h3><p> It is extremely easy to become dependent on others for every emotional or physical need we may have. Our society encourages &ldquo;togetherness&rdquo; much more than solitude. But it is in the stillness of being alone that we learn that each of us is indeed, enough. We discover ways to become more confident in who we are. Gratitude and happiness can then take root.</p><p> Ester Buchholz, Ph.D. in The Call of Solitude wrote, \"Being alone gives us the power to regulate and adjust our lives. It can teach us fortitude and the ability to satisfy our own needs. A restorer of energy, the stillness of alone experiences provides us with much-needed rest. It brings forth our longing to explore, our curiosity about the unknown, our will to be an individual, our hopes for freedom. Alone time is fuel for life.\"</p><p> Solitude is important. And it&rsquo;s important to note that solitude is not isolation. Isolation is running from something. Solitude is resting in the beauty of being alone.</p>",

And the hiring process for copywriters is usually heavily bent on these skill-sets. Make a punctuation error on your application and it&rsquo;ll surely get tossed.</p><p> Great writing, however, is very different from great marketing. Focus too much on words and you may end up forgetting the most important thing &ndash; results.</p><p> Plain and simple, your copywriting is aimed at one thing: getting a person from point A to point B.</p><p> Words are the path we use to guide our audience to our destination. Words themselves, however, are just tools.</p><p> But it&rsquo;s not the words themselves that are helping us reach our business results. It&rsquo;s the packages these words deliver to readers that we rely on.</p><h3> Let me explain&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> The fact is, we do not think in words. Look at any object around you and a series of thoughts will immediately get triggered in your mind.</p><p> As I look at the snake plant on my desk, for example, images of the outdoors, nature, the south, fresh soil, Native American pueblos, and numerous other memories come to mind. Dozens more thoughts are unconscious, beneath my recollection.</p><p> This all happens instantaneously. It took me infinitely longer to type and explain everything than how fast it went on through my mind.</p><p> We think immediately.</p><p> These thoughts are comprised of the way we humans experience life. Images. Sounds. Aromas. Feelings.</p><p> This is how we think &ndash; via experiences.</p><p> Then, and only after we&rsquo;ve relived experiences in our minds, do we take everything that went on in our thoughts and convert them into tiny little boxes of information.</p><p> These boxes are called words.</p><p> Words are merely a way of communicating with others our experiences &ndash; both in the past, present, and future.</p><p> The copywriters job is not to write fancy, nice, professional sounding words.</p><p> The copywriters job is to communicate a series of experiences that make your reader more interested in your product or service.</p><p> Use the right words that elicit the right thoughts (which elicit the right images, sounds, feelings, etc) and readers will crave the experience you depict. Use the wrong words and no matter how long, short, or fancy you write, it&rsquo;ll do nothing.</p><h3> Let me illustrate... <br/>  </h3><p> Not sure how effective your ads will be?</p><p> As a quick start, this  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/the-den/inkblot-success-test/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Digital Copywriting Success Guide  </a> </u>  at the Den outlines a few key points to ensure your ad is optimized for results.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re selling security surveillance systems for small businesses with three to five employees.</p><p> You could say something like &ldquo;XYZ Security Systems. Protection. Comfort. No more fear.&rdquo;</p><p> That&rsquo;s pretty basic though.</p><p> When you look at it, each of these words could mean so many different things to different people. This type of writing imposes very little control over the mental thoughts someone will have after reading it.</p><p> Telling someone they&rsquo;ll feel comfortable and protected is expecting the reader to come up with their own ideas on what comfort and protection mean.</p><p> Tell 100 people this description and you&rsquo;ll likely get 100 different interpretations.</p><p> Of course, it&rsquo;s inevitable that every person has their own interpretation. When writing copy, however, we must try our hardest to create a specific experience &ndash; a specific brand image. This gives us more control over our user&rsquo;s experience and allows us to augment this with other ideas, thoughts, and images.</p><p> We do this most effectively through:</p><li> Stories</li><li> Metaphors</li><li> Illustrations</li><li> Demonstrations <br/>  </li><p> When writing copy, do not focus on words. Focus on experiences. Use words merely to describe these experiences.</p><p> Demonstrate your product, do not describe your product. Do not just say your product keeps you secure, bring the process to life.</p><p> With all this said, I urge you to do this when you write&hellip; </p><p> Don&rsquo;t think about what words you should write to sell. Think about the senses that tie best into the product. Then, and only then, figure out the right words to package these experiences and deliver to readers.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> After going to a dentist in pain and being told by the receptionist, someone will get back to you within a week, I decided to make a change. <br/>  </h3><p> Not because of the dentistry, but because of how the support team made me feel.</p><p> Sunday morning, I texted my new dentist and told him I was still in pain. He called me back within 10 minutes and called in a prescription for me.</p><p> On Monday morning at 7:30 am, he scheduled my appointment. After spending Sunday evening at the hospital in extreme pain, that no prescriptions seemed to help, I was met by my dentist Monday morning to solve a very painful problem.</p><p> I hired my dentist to look after my dental and health care and solve any dental problems. He took one look at me and immediately set me up with the best specialist he knew to solve my problem.</p><p> Was I asking my dentist, who I was going to see or how much it will cost? No, I trusted another professional to refer me to an office that was in my best interest and would take care of me like my dentist does. That same morning, I was at the endodontists office and after several long hours, and a double root canal, the problem was solved and I had a huge relief.</p><p> The experience taught me the value of being a quarterback, a point person to co-ordinate my dental issues. Let&rsquo;s dig deeper to see how this all happened.</p><h3> Coordinated, organized, informed <br/>  </h3><p> First off my dentist had a solid relationship with offices who he could refer to. He did not just have one office to refer to who may be closed or busy, but several choices.</p><p> He made some calls on my behalf and organized it while I sat waiting in his office. He then forwarded information to that office so I did not have to repeat my story and rediagnose my problem. They got the whole story that morning.</p><p> The two professionals had a discussion to clarify my situation. The endodontist office greeted me as if they were prepared for me and knew me. These are all people skills, not dentistry that made me feel like a million dollars.</p><p> If you are like me and are intimidated by a dentist&rsquo;s office, imagine how I felt at the endodontist office. In the end I had two root canals completed and walked out pain free. I had a sore jaw when the freezing came out, but it was nothing compared to the pain I was in. So how does this relate to the financial industry?</p><h3> Build your professional network <br/>  </h3><p> Working with advisors, I often ask how they coordinate tax planning with clients, estate planning, risk management and insurance planning with other professionals. The answer is either they do not coordinate because of a poor excuse like accountants or lawyers never refer or return their calls. Or I get &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of many professionals to work with and refer to. It is quite simple.</p><p> I refer to it as building the \"magic six\" for EVERY IDEAL CLIENT! The \"magic six\" is knowing who the following professionals are, in your ideal client&rsquo;s lives. They may include their accountant, lawyer or estate planning professional (Trust Company) realtor, mortgage specialist, insurance agency and banker.</p><p> Set up these fields in your CRM contact management system and start coordinating your client&rsquo;s lives. Ask your ideal clients this question &ldquo;We are updating your professional contacts to make sure we coordinate your planning with them, tell me who is your accountant? What is one thing that your accountant does that you really appreciate?\" </p><p> Now, armed with this information, call the accountant and get to know them. The call would sound something like this&rdquo; Hello Brent (The accountant) I work with a mutual client (name) and they said they like (what your client said they appreciate) what you do for them and I am looking for professionals like you to work with, can we have a coffee to discuss how you may be able to help our clients more?</p><h3> Critical steps in building your network <br/>  </h3><p> First, make sure you have authorization or release of information forms and procedures to fulfil your professional obligations as well as your networks.</p><p> Each industry has their rules and understanding them is critical. Build a form for you or your team to complete to gather the information and put into your CRM contact management system.</p><p> Communicate to your network of professionals as if they are one of your ideal clients. Then they will understand what it means to be an ideal client of yours.</p><p> Share a case study or two to help them understand the value and scope of your work. Start by writing out a case study to share, one that you are really proud of.</p><p> Plan a communication schedule to keep the communication two way, so when it comes time to help a client, it is clear who in your network will work best with each ideal client. Educate your clients on the power of your network of subject matter experts in several areas, to help them advance planning in more than one area. How many times have your clients told you&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know you did that?&rdquo;</p><p> You may not do tax planning, but you can certainly coordinate it. My dentist does not do endodontists, but I did not start at an endodontist.</p><p> Start by asking your ideal clients who the \"magic six\" are in their lives. Become a better coordinator of advice today and help your clients relieve the pain in finding and coordinating all these key people in their life.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> When Linda sat down in my office, she was almost in tears. <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;In the last two months, my dad has received more than 200 offers to &lsquo;win&rsquo; sweepstakes and lotteries&mdash;and he&rsquo;s probably responded to 50 of them! I don&rsquo;t know how to stop the stream of mail coming in, and I don&rsquo;t know how to stop him from throwing his money away!&rdquo;</p><p> Unfortunately, Linda&rsquo;s dad isn&rsquo;t the only victim.</p><p> When it comes to elder abuse, financial fraud is the fastest growing culprit. If it seems like there&rsquo;s a new scam every day, it&rsquo;s because there is.</p><p> And while it&rsquo;s easy to get frustrated with mom and dad for falling prey to these scams, a recent study by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) tells us why older people are such easy targets for financial fraud.</p><p> Unlike younger generations, the over 60 crowd expects honesty in the marketplace.</p><p> Even if they do realize they&rsquo;ve been scammed, they&rsquo;re less likely to take action&mdash;either because they&rsquo;re embarrassed they&rsquo;ve been fooled or because they&rsquo;re less knowledgeable about their rights in today&rsquo;s complex (and often dishonest) consumer marketplace.</p><p> The AARP study also found that, because older people are more likely to be home than their younger neighbors, they are often within easy reach of devious telemarketers and home solicitors.</p><p> Stella is a perfect example. After her husband died, Stella decided to stay in her home. Her son Gary lived a few hours drive away, but he took care of her as best he could from a distance. He called multiple times a week, visited when he could get away, and was always there to handle any issues that came up for his mom&mdash;especially when it came to her failing health.</p><p> Everything seemed in order. Then, one day last summer, the bank called Stella. She was shocked to hear that she was out of money and her checks for her utilities were bouncing. As soon as she called Gary, he knew it was time to get a Power of Attorney and take over his mother&rsquo;s finances, but it was too little too late.</p><p> Once Gary dug into the details, he realized Stella had been the victim of a scam for years.</p><p> A &ldquo;company&rdquo; that ran a &ldquo;contest&rdquo; had been plying her with prizes that had started out small&mdash;Sunbeam mixers, toasters, and knife sets&mdash;and gotten bigger and bigger over time. Of course, every time the very nice people called to tell her she&rsquo;d won something new, they offered her the opportunity to pay for the chance to win an even grander prize next time. Stella had been hooked&mdash;to the tune of over $100,000.</p><p> The AARP&rsquo;s study highlighted some of the characteristics that make older people vulnerable to fraud, but age-related dementia adds to the problem significantly.</p><p> Research has shown that about half of adults in their 80s have either dementia or some level of cognitive impairment without dementia. If these folks are living alone, they&rsquo;re prime targets for fraud.</p><p> But what does all this mean when it comes to your own parents? How do you know when to offer help?</p><p> Linda was blown away by the fact that her father who had always been money-wise was writing checks to sweepstakes companies.</p><p> Gary had been keeping a close eye on Stella, and he felt she was still capable of &ldquo;paying a few bills&rdquo; and managing her own money.</p><p> Luckily Linda and Gary stepped in when they did.</p><h3> Here's seven steps to help avoid the fraud in the first place: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Talk to your parents long before you need to <br/>  </h3><p> The earlier you talk about the potential for cognitive decline, the easier it will be to set up a future game plan together.</p><h3> 2. Get a copy of the Durable Power of Attorney (POA) <br/>  </h3><p>  If you&rsquo;ve created the document together before any signs of decline, you should already know what to expect. If you haven&rsquo;t, the POA will indicate if and when you&rsquo;re able to take the financial reins.</p><h3> 3. Watch for signs of mental decline <br/>  </h3><p> If you think your parent may be slipping a little&mdash;or a lot&mdash;schedule an appointment together to see a neurologist. Not only can the doctor help you both understand what to expect in the short and long term, but he or she can also recommend next steps when it comes to managing finances. </p><h3> 4. Arrange face-to-face visits <br/>  </h3><p> If you live far away, ask someone in the area&mdash;a close friend, sibling, or neighbor&mdash;to check in now and then to see what is going on. If they spot something suspicious, they can let you know before a small issue has time to escalate.</p><h3> 5. Get access to bank account records online <br/>  </h3><p> Even if there have been no financial missteps made (yet), ask for permission to look over the expenses and deposits periodically. If something doesn&rsquo;t add up, start asking questions and follow up.</p><h3> 6. When appropriate, take over the checkbook <br/>  </h3><p> As soon as there is any sign of mental decline, get signatory authorization on bank accounts and agree on reasonable spending limits. Give mom an ATM card with a cash-withdrawal limit or give her a monthly allowance of cash.</p><h3> 7. If you need help, work with a financial advisor <br/>  </h3><p> Don&rsquo;t assume that just because mom or dad needs your help that you have the knowledge to make the best decisions. If taking over your parents&rsquo; financial lives requires more than basic bill paying, get help from a financial fiduciary.</p><p> Watching mom or dad decline is never easy. We all want our parents to be the family guardians they once were.</p><p> Of course, it&rsquo;s even harder for our parents to admit their own failings&mdash;especially when it comes to money. But the sooner you address the issue, the sooner you can begin to combat potential fraud.</p><p> Take steps today to keep mom&rsquo;s $100,000 toaster in the hungry hands of even the most convincing &ldquo;sweepstakes representative.&rdquo;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://mike-robbins.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mike Robbins  </a> </u></p><h3> How flexible are you? For me, it depends &ndash; on my mood, how much fear or resistance I have about something, how attached I am to a particular outcome, and various other factors. <br/>  </h3><p> However, as I look throughout my life (now and in the past), I realize that the situations, relationships, and experiences that cause me the greatest stress and frustration, are almost always the ones where I&rsquo;m not being flexible. And, on the flip side, the more flexible I am &ndash; the more peace, ease, and fulfillment become available.</p><p> Today, more than ever, we are challenged to be flexible &ndash; in our work, our relationships, and in every other important aspect of our lives.</p><p> However, due to our own fear, arrogance, resistance, stress, and obsession with being right, we often end up being inflexible to our own detriment and to the frustration of those around us (or so I&rsquo;ve been told).</p><p> Being flexible is not about being weak or passive. Flexibility is a conscious choice, a powerful skill, and a valuable approach to the ever-changing, always-evolving world we live in. We can be firm in our convictions, passionate about our beliefs, and clear about our intentions, and at the same time be flexible enough to make significant changes and be open to new ideas along the way.</p><h3> Here are five ways to expanding your own capacity for flexibility in your life &ndash; which will lead you to greater success, joy, and fulfillment: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Let Go of Your Attachment <br/>  </h3><p> Whenever we get attached to something &ndash; a specific outcome, a particular way of doing things, a rigid opinion, etc. &ndash; we are, by definition, inflexible. Letting go of our attachment to something doesn&rsquo;t mean we negate our desire or intention, it simply means we let go of controlling every aspect of it, forcing the action, and our fixation on it being exactly the way we think it should be. This is a process of conscious &ldquo;non-attachment&rdquo; (letting go), as opposed to detachment (not caring).</p><h3> 2. Be Willing to Be Wrong <br/>  </h3><p> Most of us love to be right and will do and say just about anything to avoid being wrong.  Our obsession with &ldquo;rightness&rdquo; and fear of &ldquo;wrongness&rdquo; often gets in the way of going for what we want, saying what&rsquo;s on our mind, and letting go of our fixed ideas about how things are supposed to be.  When we&rsquo;re willing to be wrong (not necessarily interested in or intending to be wrong), we free ourselves up and give ourselves permission to take risks, try new things, and approach things (even really important things) with a creative, innovative, and flexible perspective.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t Take Yourself Too Seriously <br/>  </h3><p> Taking ourselves too seriously (something which I know a thing or two about), creates unnecessary stress, pressure, and worry.  When we&rsquo;re able to laugh at ourselves (in a kind way), keep things in perspective, and remember that most of what we deal with on a daily basis in life is not life or death &ndash; we can take ourselves less seriously and thus have a more balanced, peaceful, and creative way of relating to things.</p><h3> 4. Go with the Flow <br/>  </h3><p> If we pay attention to life, there is a natural flow that exists (although it may not always look like it or feel like it).  The more we&rsquo;re able to tap into the natural flow of life, trust ourselves and others, and believe that things will work out &ndash; the more likely we are to allow things to roll off our backs and manifest with ease.  As Esther Hicks says, &ldquo;Most people are rowing against the current of life.  Instead of turning the boat around, all they need to do it let go of the oars.&rdquo;</p><h3> 5. Get Support and Feedback From Others <br/>  </h3><p> The support and feedback of others is invaluable in so many aspects of our life and growth, especially as it relates to us being more flexible.  We can learn from and model others who are more flexible than we are.  We can also give people in our life permission to remind us (with kindness) when we get rigid, uptight, over-attached, and start taking ourselves too seriously.</p><p> Being flexible is something that&rsquo;s often easier said than done for many of us. However, just as with our physical bodies, the more attention we place on expanding our flexibility the more likely we are to do it.  As we enhance our ability to be flexible, our life can and will expand exponentially.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> It&rsquo;s probably no surprise to most that women earn less on average than men; however, one interesting element of this disparity is the impact of having children. <br/>  </h3><p> According to Michelle Budig&rsquo;s research study titled &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://content.thirdway.org/publications/853/NEXT_-_Fatherhood_Motherhood.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Fatherhood Bonus &amp; The Motherhood Penalty  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; men&rsquo;s salaries tend to increase after having children, while women&rsquo;s decrease.</p><p> The study compares data on men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s earnings, and then evaluates some hypotheses for the disparity.</p><p> &ldquo;Why might men&rsquo;s earnings rise when they become fathers?&rdquo; Budig asks.</p><h3> She offers two potential sources of correlation: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Treatment Effect: </strong> Men with children are treated preferentially.</p><p> <strong>  Selection Effect: </strong> Men who have children have certain characteristics that make them more likely to earn higher wages, and vice versa.</p><p> After analyzing the data, Budig concludes that the former is a more compelling reason: &ldquo;Fatherhood is a valued characteristic of employers, signaling perhaps greater work commitment, stability, and deservingness.&rdquo;</p><h3> According to Budig, there are at least five explanations for lower earnings among mothers than childless women: <br/>  </h3><p> 1. Many women interrupt their careers to stay home to care for their children. That interruption can, later, leader to lower wages and disparities between their salaries and the salaries of their male colleagues who didn&rsquo;t interrupt their careers in the same way.</p><p> 2. Also because of the greater likelihood for women to take on more of the child caretaking role, they may decide to forego higher wage opportunities in favor of jobs at companies that are more &ldquo;mother-friendly,&rdquo; and that allow them the work-life balance they require.</p><p> 3. Budig suggests that the demands of childrearing may also leave mothers &ldquo;exhausted or distracted at work, rendering them less productive.&rdquo;</p><p> 4. There may be an impact caused by employers that may discriminate against mothers by making assumptions about their levels of commitment and, consequently, not assigning them the same types of tasks or providing the same types of opportunities that serve to propel their male colleagues further up the ladder&mdash;and pay scale.</p><p> 5. Finally, suggests, Budig, &ldquo;women who are less likely to earn higher wages may be more likely to become mothers, and the relationship between motherhood and wages can be explained by these other factors.&rdquo;</p><p> The key takeaway: maybe It&rsquo;s not just gender at play, but other impacts as well. Bulig&rsquo;s research suggests that skilled, well-educated, higher-earning women are less likely to experience a pay gap after having children than those in low-skill, low-paying jobs.</p><p> Disparities certainly exist in many organizations; do they exist at yours? If so, what&rsquo;s behind the disparities? This salary calculator provided by The Washington Post provides some interesting insights into the impacts of age, marital status, race/ethnicity and educational levels on salary.</p><p> Take a look at the salary levels in your organization&mdash;how do they compare?</p>",

Kathy thinks Carol gets special treatment and Rich thinks Tom is straight up dumb.&rdquo;</p><p> You would never of course make such an announcement, but forwarding someone&rsquo;s email is essentially doing this. If someone came up to you and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a problem with so and so&rdquo; chances are you wouldn&rsquo;t go straight to so and so and say, &ldquo;I know someone who has a problem with you and here&rsquo;s why.&rdquo; The reason you wouldn&rsquo;t do this is because it&rsquo;s cruel to all parties and feelings would be hurt on both sides. You would also alienate yourself and be considered untrustworthy.</p><p> &mdash; &ndash;</p><h3> <strong>  Maybe Try this Instead? </strong></h3><p> <br/> At the very least you can simply copy/paste/reformat the email sent to you, reformatted to sound neutral. You could also ask the employee with the complaint to start a new email and cc you so the recipient feels the urgency. Or you could encourage the employee to try and work it out a different way with the offending party, giving them the opportunity to work on their conflict management skills. If all else fails and you can&rsquo;t help yourself from engaging in this habit, let employees know that whatever they email you is liable to be forwarded, so they have the chance to consider how comfortable they&rsquo;d feel if what they wrote were broadcast to the rest of the company. A good old-fashioned warning always takes the sting out of sucker punch.</p>",

    "title": "8 Pointers to Recruiting the Very Best Client Advisory Board",
    "link": "8-pointers-to-recruiting-the-very-best-client-advisory-board",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The success and value of your advisory board experience is heavily influenced by who sits around the table providing you feedback. <br/>  </h3><p> The client advisory board is the most powerful tool I know for soliciting valuable, actionable feedback to help you improve your client experience.</p><p> The kind of experience your best clients will want to tell their friends about and turn into referrals. And to get the clearest, most focused guidance you will need to carefully compose the group. </p><h3> <strong>  Here are eight pointers to put together the best possible group: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Clients in your target market <br/>  </h3><p> when I am working with an advisor on assembling a new board, before I start making suggestions I will usually ask &ldquo;who do you think you would like to have in the group?&rdquo; A fairly common response is &ldquo;a representative sample of my clients.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t see this as ideal. You can get clearer, more consistent feedback from a group comprised of specifically the kinds of clients you would like to attract. Who from your client base would you most like to clone? Bringing together clients of different descriptions, who look to you for different things makes the feedback muddled and confused. What they tell you can be hard to interpret or hard to translate into specific changes or improvements. Or you may get different board members wanting very different things. If you can put together a group with profiles who are consistent from the perspective of what they most value from you, you can get a richer, deeper conversation and better guidance.</p><h3> 2. Prospects in your ideal market <br/>  </h3><p> Most client advisory boards are made up mostly clients, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to limit it to that. In some cases, let&rsquo;s say you are trying to open up a new market or make better penetration into a market that a minority of your clients come from, you can invite people from that profile even if they are not currently clients. I have facilitated several groups composed entirely of representatives of a target market and even centers of influence who were not clients. There are a few special considerations to keep in mind when you extend the invitation to participate. But that outsider&rsquo;s perspective can be surprisingly valuable.</p><h3> 3. Biggest is not always best <br/>  </h3><p> You will probably want your biggest clients on your advisory board and most of my clients&rsquo; boards include some of their biggest clients. Many (maybe most) advisors can think of one or two of their larger clients that just don&rsquo;t fit the mold of most of their clients or the clients they most want to attract. You are better off without those clients on your board.</p><h3> 4. Choose clients who utilize the full range of your services <br/>  </h3><p> If you define your value proposition by specific services or as a collection of services (if you are tempted to use the words &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; or &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; in describing what you do) choose clients who utilize those services. This most frequently comes up when an advisor who does financial planning thinks about inviting an \"investment only\" client on to their advisory board. Clients who do not take advantage of what you consider your flagship services or those services that you think differentiate you from other financial advisors are not in a position to give you quality feedback about those services. They will also likely not provide you referrals of people who seek those special services. Even if they have ideas about it, they clearly do not value it. They are not credible sources of guidance on how to improve those services. (The one potential exception to this might be clients who indicated they would use the service provided a few aspects of it were changed.) Put the emphasis on clients who come to you for the kind of work you believe makes you special.</p><h3> 5. Clients who have had a bump in the relationship <br/>  </h3><p> Who do you think are your most loyal clients and most likely to refer you? It is not usually the ones where everything has always gone well. You might be surprised, but the most loyal clients are often the ones who, at some point, had a problem that you addressed promptly and resolved satisfactorily. And what better way to demonstrate your commitment to making sure that things consistently improve than to invite those clients onto your advisory board? Having board members who have had to express a concern to you also help get the right culture going within your board. You want people who can speak to some of the defects and blemishes in your service. The most value you can realize from your client advisory board experience comes from identifying something that can be improved for the better. Solicit participation from people for whom you had to fix something.</p><h3> 6. Centers of influence <br/>  </h3><p> Many of the advisors I work with invite a center of influence on to their board. One advantage is that (assuming they have referred clients to you) they can represent the perspective of several (or even many) clients. This effectively multiplies the feedback you can get. Another is that they get to hear firsthand how much other ideal clients love you and the service you provide. The ultimate outcome you probably seek from having an advisory board is an increase in referrals, and a center of influence is in a much better position to be a source of referrals than a client. Clients occasionally hear their friends say things that might trigger them to refer you. An accountant or attorney probably meets with people who would make great clients on a regular basis. They can also share ideas and strategies that have been effective with clients like yours from their own experience.</p><h3> 7. Think broadly about centers of influence <br/>  </h3><p> Accountants and attorneys are the obvious candidates but who else is influential in the community of your target market? If you want to do more work with physicians, how about the chair of the local medical society or a dean from the local medical school? If you focus on employees of a local university, why not consider an executive from their HR or benefits office? If you can think of someone you might like to network with, they might be a candidate.</p><h3> 8. Connectors <br/>  </h3><p> We know that some clients refer more prolifically than others. There are just some people who like to get other people together. They like to find solutions and resources for practically anyone they meet. Provided they are in your target markets community (and I mean that culturally rather than geographically) they can be a great addition to your board.</p><p> If you are thinking about putting together your client advisory board, who would be the top 10 people you would most want to participate? If you currently have a board, how many of these categories above are represented? Fine tune the membership of your board, and you can derive significantly more value.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I knew it was bad, but just didn&rsquo;t know how bad. <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m talking about the average time it takes for a company to respond, via different social media channels.</p><p> A recent study put out by  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.eptica.com/500_retail_study_2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Eptica  </a> </u>  evaluated 500 US retailers&rsquo; ability to respond, by asking 10 routine questions. The average amount of time it takes for many of these companies to reply is staggeringly disappointing.</p><p> <strong>  Here are a few of the stats and facts: </strong></p><li> For email the average response time was 7 hours and 51 minutes!</li><li> For Facebook the average response time was one day, 3 hours and 7 minutes!</li><li> For Twitter the average response time was one day, 7 hours and 12 minutes! <br/>  </li><p> This is nuts! If I have a problem, and I contact the company, I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait almost eight hours to get a response. Maybe all I have is a simple question, I&rsquo;m not even upset or angry. But, due to the frustration of having to wait hours, or even a day or more, for a response; my simple question becomes a customer service debacle.</p><p> Is it just me? As it turns out, most customers are a little more tolerant than I am, but they still experience frustration.</p><p> The Eptica study also polled 1,000 consumers on how long they were willing to wait when they connected with the companies through these channels.</p><p> While most people are more accepting of the longer wait times; their patience doesn&rsquo;t last as long as the average company makes them wait.</p><p> <strong>  In the case of Facebook and Twitter, they aren&rsquo;t even close: </strong></p><li> 77% of consumers won&rsquo;t wait more than six hours for an email response.</li><li> 85% of consumers using Facebook expect an answer within six hours.</li><li> 64% of consumers using Twitter expect a response within an hour. <br/>  </li><p> All this looks like gloom and doom in the world of customer service, but there is good news.</p><p> Yes, there are some rock stars out there who put others to shame. Some of these great companies respond within a minute or less. But more importantly, this report is a wake-up call for all of us.</p><p> Quick response matters! Look at this report and determine which industry you&rsquo;re in. And, if you feel that B2B doesn&rsquo;t apply, you&rsquo;re wrong. Regardless of the industry and the numbers, the concept of quick response is universal. When your customer has a question, they want an answer. When your customer has a problem, they want it resolved. And most don&rsquo;t want to wait a day or two for you to get back to them.</p><p> My suggestion is to take some action. First, download the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.eptica.com/sh_retail_2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   report  </a> </u> , it&rsquo;s free. Then, take a look at your response times. And consider this, while the response times focus on outside customers, how long do you take to respond to the people you work with, also known as your internal customers? Those are very important customers as well!</p>",

    "title": "7 Things to Do When Starting a Business to Avoid Nasty Surprises",
    "link": "7-things-to-do-when-starting-a-business-to-avoid-nasty-surprises",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> When you decide to start a business, taxes may be the last thing you think about. </h3><p> <br/> However, not realizing that you owe the self-employment tax as well as income taxes can lead to a nasty surprise when you file your taxes.  This post is aimed at avoiding that costly surprise. </p><p> But, before we discuss the self-employment tax, there are other important steps to take when you become self-employed.  Here are the 7 things to do after you start your own business to avoid nasty surprises:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Set up bookkeeping right away </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even before you think about income taxes, be sure to set up bookkeeping using software like QuickBooks (either online or on your laptop).  You don't want to be scrambling to find receipts at tax time or not be able to tell somebody if you are making money or not.  </p><p> You can save time by downloading from your bank and credit card companies.  If you become wildly successful, you can hire a bookkeeper to take over managing the input, downloading and reconciling.</p><p> If you set up things well, all income and every expense will be properly categorized for your profit and loss statement, or P&amp;L, and for your balance sheet.  The P&amp;L is essential for preparing your tax returns.  The P&amp;L and balance sheet help you monitor your business to see how well you are doing.  The balance sheet will also come in handy if you need to apply for financing.</p><p> To ensure that your bookkeeping is set up well, you may want to consult with an accountant.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Form an entity </strong></h3><p> <br/> For many small businesses, being a sole proprietor is appropriate.  You avoid paying corporate excise taxes and filing annual reports.  For income taxes, you just file on Schedule C of the federal form 1040.  </p><p> However, if you have partners, you may want to form a partnership, corporation or LLC.  Details on choosing are beyond the scope of this post. </p><p> If your business involves risks that could lead to law suits, form a corporation or LLC to shelter your personal assets from liabilities of the business that insurance may not cover.  Make sure that any actions you take for the business are in your capacity as an officer or manager &ndash; i.e., never sign personally.</p><p> To ensure that you make the proper choice of entity, you may want to consult with an attorney.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Get licenses, file annual reports and pay local taxes </strong></h3><p> <br/> Certain businesses require a license to operate.  If you hire an attorney to form your LLC or corporation, she can check this out for you. </p><p> Most entities are required to file annual reports.  If you are not a single member LLC, you also have to file income tax returns for the entity.  The entity in turn provides you with the information for your personal tax return, which would be in the form of a K-1 for an LLC, partnership or S corporation.  </p><p> Your city may impose taxes on the personal property in your business.  Be sure to find out so you don&rsquo;t owe penalties for failing to file and pay.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Buy health and other insurance </strong></h3><p> <br/> In addition to liability insurance, you will want to obtain health insurance if you are no longer working for another employer.  You may get favorable treatment for this expense on your income taxes &ndash; the IRS allows the self-employed to deduct health insurance on the front of your form 1040 &ndash; an &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; deduction.  In this case, the &ldquo;self-employed&rdquo; includes over 2% shareholders of private corporations and members of LLCs.</p><p> You can also purchase insurance to cover damage to equipment, loss of data, identity theft and so on.  </p><p> You may want to ask your accountant or attorney if she can recommend anyone for your insurance needs.</p><h3> <strong>  5. File payroll taxes </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you hire people to work for you and pay them over $600 per quarter in any year, you need to report the compensation.  If they are independent contractors, you file a form 1099 with the IRS.  If they are employees, you file a W-2 with the Social Security Administration.  You also provide these forms to your people for the income tax filings. </p><p> If you have employees, you need to withhold and remit FICA and Medicare taxes.  You have to remit what you withheld and make equal contributions to FICA and Medicare taxes for each employee.  You will file and pay at least as often as every quarter. </p><p> Your employees may also request that you withhold and remit federal and state income taxes (unless you live in a state that does not impose income taxes).  Failure to withhold and pay to the IRS and state can lead to serious penalties.</p><p> Check with your accountant or attorney to see which filings apply to your business and when they are due.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Pay your income tax </strong></h3><p> <br/> One big shock for many who start a business is how much they owe in taxes.  </p><p> When you received a paycheck, you probably did not focus much on the fact that your employer withholds federal and state income taxes and FICA and Medicare taxes. </p><p> More importantly, you never had a chance to spend what was withheld.  However, when you run your own business, you have full access to the pre-tax income, so you have to diligently allocate funds ahead of time so that you don't come up short at text time.</p><p> To avoid owing interest on the taxes due, you make estimated tax payments each quarter to the IRS and state.  Check with your accountant or attorney for payment vouchers and due dates.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Pay the self-employment tax </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you were an employee, your employer withheld FICA and Medicare taxes from you paychecks.  The employer also contributed FICA and Medicare taxes on your behalf</p><p> When you become self-employed, you are responsible for both the employee and employer amounts.  This tax is based on your net self-employment income from Schedule C or the K-1 from your S corporation or LLC, and is calculated and reported on your federal form 1040. </p><p> A lot to remember, right?  Maybe, but knowing and planning ahead is far better than trying to scrape together money in April to cover taxes you did not expect.  <strong>  Good luck with your new business! </strong></p>",

    "content": "<h3> In my experience, the greatest moments for career advancement come in times of uncertainty and disruption. <br/>  </h3><p> I know this sounds counter intuitive but its very true and something most of us overlook or won't admit.</p><p> During highly tumultuous periods, like in an acquisition or management shake-up, the opportunities are actually at their greatest and your competition are at their worst. In these chaotic times, roles change, departments get reorganized and objectives and power shift. If you execute strategically you can find many career advancing opportunities.</p><p> If you operate emotionally (like most people) you can lose out on your best chance to get ahead. While your peers are rebelling to change and worrying what the future may hold, you need to be executing your advancement strategy. </p><img src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51291c09e4b0997773739017/t/5397bb82e4b09fb5ec08f1bf/1402452867962/?format=750w\"/><p>  </p><p> <strong>  Here are some tips for how to embrace change from the book   <u>   <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601633203/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p14_d1_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1N5PZAXHFGJ5R6BCQT2E&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    Stealing the Corner Office   </a>  </u>  : </strong></p><p> A very important first step is to create a Change Playbook so you can take advantage of these moments when they present themselves.</p><p> I find it helpful to document my game plan when I see big changes coming. The process of actually writing my plan down helps to remind me how important it is to be consciously executing purposeful tactics during these periods versus reacting emotionally.</p><p> I recently met with a business partner who confided in me within an hour of meeting him that he had a new boss he couldn't stand. He just couldn't figure out how to deal with him and he and the rest of the team missed their old boss immensely. As much as he delivered the polite version of his plight, it was pretty obvious that he and his peers were not handling this change scenario well. </p><p> A management change is almost universally mishandled by staff who fight against what has already taken place in some naive hope their discontent can actually reverse time.</p><p> In this case, when your peers are all gossiping and griping about the evil new boss, you should be actively networking with him or her and finding ways to be helpful in the transition.</p><p> Getting on the winning side of change is as much about choosing to play on the winning team as it is about any specific strategy. Having a positive attitude and aligning yourself with the eventual winners are your keys to success.</p><p> So when change is afoot, I jot down a few key notes in three basic areas to guide my behaviors. It reminds me that my goal is to get ahead in the company and not to vent my emotions or misgivings about the situation. Here is a sample of what that might look like:</p><p> <img alt=\" Sample Change Playbook\" src=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51291c09e4b0997773739017/t/5397bc2fe4b09fb5ec08f2f3/1402453066013/?format=750w\"/></p><p> The first area I focus on is my Influencer List. It has most likely evolved as a result of the change that has occurred. I make a quick list of who the key players are and who can most profoundly influence my success or failure in the new environment. My only caution is not to let any personal misgivings cloud your assessment of who actually has power and influence. Sometimes we can convince ourselves power hasn&rsquo;t shifted when in fact it has.</p><p> The second thing I take note of is what key transition projects are likely to take place or have been scheduled already. I want to be a part of these and will do whatever I can to participate. These will come in the form of process alignment meetings, systems integrations, best practice sharing and a variety of other events. They all have the goal of smoothing the transition from the old way to the new way. You will participate on these committees and in these meetings ostensibly to help in the transition most importantly you&rsquo;re tactically demonstrating leadership and networking with the winning team.</p><p> The final area I make note of is how I can advance my position during the change period. Specifically, what actions I will take to proactively improve my status. This can include things like booking a meeting with the new boss to understand her priorities and challenges. It might be taking one or two new people out for lunch or dinner after an acquisition. It can be the small things and conversations that reveal the best opportunities for career advancements in a highly dynamic environment. If you see yourself doing the same old routine, or trying to ignore the chaos around you &ndash; you should stop and get involved.</p><p> The most important thing in taking advantage of change scenarios is your attitude. Get on the winning team. Do the opposite of what the masses are doing. Find opportunities to demonstrate leadership in the face of disruption which will often be present during this times. Get strategic during turmoil and you will rise to the top.</p><p> <strong>  Here are three quick tips that will make sure you embrace the changes everyone else hates and ultimately end up on top: </strong></p><li> Make a change plan. You need to actually write down what your plan is or your emotions will likely get the best of you. Jot down some tactics when a major transition occurs to force yourself to act strategically and not emotionally.</li><li> Pick the winner with your mind not your heart. Make an objective assessment of which side is likely to come out on top and join that team. If someone has just bought your company or has just taken over your department &ndash; choose that team. Don&rsquo;t fight against the winning side.</li><li> Leave your ego at the door. If you execute the correct change playbook, people will make fun of you and tease you for being a suck up. Ignore them. Your career is not about making friends, it&rsquo;s about advancement. </li>",

With a more promising outlook, you will be hearing &ldquo;yes&rdquo; more often.</p><h3> My Story <br/>  </h3><p> This week, I issued more requests than normal. And to my great surprise, I heard &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to every single one. The differentiator is that my contacts and I built enough familiarity with one another that their desire to be of help became my reward.</p><p> In past years, my way of practicing negotiation was to on occasion ask favors of employers, co-workers and clientele. The requests weren&rsquo;t earth shaking but I was able to ensure that my style came across well enough to be granted a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; most of the time.</p><p> The one strategy for any request or negotiation, that makes an enormous difference, is to not have your heart set on it. You are able to live with either answer from the other party, or when negotiating, you will be the one willing to walk away.</p><h3> Your Story <br/>  </h3><p> Are you the type of person who is timid about asking for a favor? Business depends upon the ask, and it helps to be well prepared. The fact is that those who excel in sales earn only about 25% of the business they initially approach.</p><p> In business, you need to become accustomed to either answer of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. To ease the pain of so much negativity, one has to have a pipeline filled with sales possibilities at all times. The mind is fixated on the better opportunities that are to be found.</p><li> Are you willing to accept either answer?</li><li> Do you recognize that quickly moving away from the no will lead you more quickly to a yes?</li><li> Is your communication style friendly enough to encourage a positive response?</li><li> Do you grant requests when they come your way?</li><li> Do you believe you are balanced in your give and take?</li><p> As you become accustomed to delivering favors, it becomes easier and natural to also ask.</p><p> Just the simple gesture of offering to share someone&rsquo;s news online will be encouragement for that person to grant your request.</p><p> The ultimate sales strategy is for others to find you as a person with whom it is easy to work. This holds true for job seekers, career advancement, and entrepreneurs.</p><h3> Sales Tips <br/>  </h3><li> When you speak have others hear the smile in your voice</li><li> Show genuine interest in what others have to say.</li><li> Naturally offer help without asking anything in return.</li><li> Volunteer sound introductions.</li><li> When in need of a favor, ask it with appreciation for consideration of your request.</li><li> Practice asking small favors in order to become comfortable with the larger.</li><li> Eliminate attachment to requests.</li><li> Use requests as a training ground for negotiation.</li><li> Become comfortable speaking about money, budgets, and related topics.</li><li> When requests are approved, show sincere appreciation.</li>",

    "link": "do-you-know-the-7-stages-of-the-new-buying-cycle",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Lately, I spent some time thinking about how the B2B buying cycle has changed in recent years.</h3>During my reflection, I realized that one of the most significant changes in how buyers buy today (versus how they bought even five short years ago) lies in the stages of the buying cycle.Since the dawn of mankind, there&rsquo;s been a more or less set process that we all go through when making buying decisions &ndash; a series of steps, designed to help us go from where we are blissfully unaware that a problem even exists, to investing our hard-earned cash in exchange for a solution.<h3> Regardless of the exact terminology used, a traditional, basic buying cycle looks something like this:</h3><h3> <strong>  Stage I &ndash; Awareness </strong></h3>We become aware of a problem, need or challenge facing us, or an opportunity to get captured. This leads to dissatisfaction, and a desire to take action<h3> <strong>  Stage II &ndash; Outreach </strong></h3>We reach out to others, do research and speak with potential vendors in an effort to understand what potential solutions exist, and which might fit our needs best<h3> <strong>  Stage III &ndash; Selection </strong></h3>During the research phase, we develop a preference for one particular vendor or solution. They become what we call the &ldquo;emotional favorite&rdquo;, gradually moving into the position of the winner<h3> <strong>  Stage IV &ndash; Purchase </strong></h3>We purchase the desired product or service, thereby (hopefully) addressing the problem or challenge and meeting our needsThe universe of your average buyer &ndash; and their buying cycle &ndash; has changed pretty dramatically in recent years. The rise of the Internet as a ubiquitous, on-demand, always-open source of information. The amount of content marketing and thought leadership that is available to anyone with a browser.The advent of new technologies, making it possible for startups to compete on even ground with long-established businesses. The increased role of risk, meaning much higher stakes when things go wrong. And the rise of Procurement from an administrative function to a strategic player on the corporate stage.All of this has had a fundamental impact on buyer behavior &ndash; and more specifically, on the steps of buyers go through when considering purchasing new products and/or services.<h3> <img alt=\"New Buying Cycle\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/buying-cycle.png \"/></h3><h3> <strong>  Buyers do vastly more research </strong></h3>After the Awareness stage, buyers now take advantage of all the possibilities available to them to conduct deep, extensive early-stage research on vendors and their products and services. According to <a href=\"https://www.siriusdecisions.com/Blog/2013/Jul/Three-Myths-of-the-67-Percent-Statistic.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Sirius Decisions</a>, &ldquo;67 percent of the buyer&rsquo;s journey is now done digitally. (Our) research shows that online searches are executives&rsquo; first course of action (just like everyone else).&ldquo;The research stage is probably the most important, &ldquo;new&rdquo; stage in the buying cycle. It&rsquo;s not that buyers were not doing their homework before &ndash; it is simply that they have taken things to an entirely new level.If you are in sales, one of your main priorities should be to identify, connect with and support buyers who are currently researching the types of products and services that you are offering. And I don&rsquo;t mean this is a job for the marketing team either: every seller today should personally act as a mini-marketer, providing helpful, relevant and high-quality thought leadership and content to prospects and potential buyers in the research stage.<h3> <strong>  Buyers expect collaboration </strong></h3>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard the old joke. &ldquo;How do you know a salesperson is lying ?&rdquo; Answer: &ldquo;His lips are moving.&rdquo;Unfortunately, the sales profession has gotten a bad rep over the years, with &ldquo;salesperson&rdquo; being synonymous with words like manipulative, self-serving, short-term focused and &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo;.Buyers today are tired of being sold to &ndash; they have seen all the tricks, read all the books and are acutely aware of when sellers are trying to manipulate them.But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that buyers don&rsquo;t want to interact with sellers &ndash; in fact, far from it. In high-end, complex B2B sales, the role of the individual seller in helping sophisticated buyers make purchasing decisions has become more important than ever.In RAIN Group&rsquo;s research on &ldquo;What Sales Winners Do Differently&rdquo;, we uncovered that the #2 factor that makes buyers decide to work with one firm versus another is  because &ldquo;(the seller) collaborated with me&rdquo;.Buyers still (very much) value savvy, well-educated and well-informed sellers who act more like high-end management consultants than the traditional stereotypical &ldquo;salesperson&rdquo;. They want to interact with peers, we can help to explore new opportunities, develop scenarios and gradually develop to a solution that fits for them and their firm &ndash; but they want to do it together.<h3> <strong>  Buyers will negotiate on everything </strong></h3>Welcome to the new reality: everything is negotiable.In the past, negotiation revolve mostly on price. Procurement came in, usually during the final stages of the buying cycle, to help secure a deal that was advantageous to the buyers firm (whilst, of course, retaining a reasonable margin for the seller).In today&rsquo;s world, everything is up for grabs. Payment terms. Project scope. Buy-it-from-you versus build-it-for-me. Knowledge transfer. Intellectual property.Not only will buyers negotiate on more aspects of the deal, but they will often negotiate with several vendors simultaneously. Meaning negotiations take longer to complete, and have become an integral part of the buying cycle &ndash; far from an afterthought.In recent years the buying cycle has undergone tremendous, profound changes. It&rsquo;s not so much that before, buyers were not doing any research, did not collaborate and didn&rsquo;t negotiate. It&rsquo;s that today, these aspects have taken up a much more important, front-and-center role in the buying process.Savvy sellers understand that in today&rsquo;s world, buyers hold more power than before &ndash; but like experienced martial artists, they also understand that understanding how to work with that power can yield tremendous benefits.And here is the real silver lining: sellers who are able to educate their buyers with new ideas and perspectives, collaborate with buyers and help them see how the overall value they offer is superior to other options not only win the deal today &ndash; but build strong, mutually rewarding relationships for the future.",

    "content": "<h3> Throughout our new book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://winningwellbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Winning Well  </a> </u> , David and I talk consistently about the importance of confidence, humility, results and relationships. <br/>  </h3><p> So many of the managers we work with tell us that the hardest part to master is confidence.</p><p> Even those highly successful managers who appear to be Winning Well and making a difference will often take us aside and admit that they sometimes feel like a fake.</p><p> They feel as if their success rests on a knife&rsquo;s edge. One false move, one tiny mistake, and everyone would know they were nothing but a well-spoken fraud.</p><p> This is what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;impostor syndrome.&rdquo;</p><p> Imposter sydrome describes that feeling of strong self-doubt that you&rsquo;re a fake, that your success is due more to luck or your ability to fool people than it is due to your work, and it often comes with your fear of being found out.</p><p> If you let it, imposter syndrome will tie you in knots, ruin your confidence, and undermine your ability to lead your people and achieve your goals&ndash;not to mention screw up your life in many other ways.</p><p> We know. We&rsquo;ve been there too.</p><p> At earlier times in our lives, David and I have felt as if we didn&rsquo;t belonging that boardroom, didn&rsquo;t feel that others would take us seriously, that we weren&rsquo;t as smart, as proficient, as musical, or as experienced as we needed to be compared to that group we were working with.</p><p> The brutal truth is that you can&rsquo;t be the manager you need to be when you&rsquo;re tied up in knots like that. You&rsquo;ll try to overcompensate, or you&rsquo;ll stay silent when you should speak. Either one will kill your credibility and end your influence.</p><p> There are several tools you can use to overcome this self-sabotage. Here are just a few. </p><h3> 5 Ways to Overcome Impostor Syndrome <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Honor Your Past and Your Present <br/>  </h3><p> One of David&rsquo;s mentors said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing to remember where you came from, but it&rsquo;s a foolish thing to think you&rsquo;re still there. &rdquo;</p><p> His point is that your experiences in childhood and earlier life can serve you, help you make good decisions, give you an appreciation for people from all walks of life, and keep you from being judgmental. It would be foolish to leave that treasure behind. But it would be equally foolhardy to not acknowledge today&rsquo;s circumstances. That&rsquo;s intellectually dishonest and dishonors the people who have put their trust in you today.</p><h3> 2. Remember that You&rsquo;re Always &ldquo;Too Something&rdquo; For Someone <br/>  </h3><p> These wise words came from 1999 world champion of public speaking and motivational speaker, Craig Valentine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always too something for someone&rdquo; gets at the absurdity of it all, because once you start looking for inadequacy, you&rsquo;ll always find a reason you don&rsquo;t belong.</p><h3> 3. Laugh at Your Doubts <br/>  </h3><p> When David writes and self-doubt begins to wrap him in its constricting coils, telling him he can&rsquo;t write anything unless it&rsquo;s absolutely perfect, he can almost hug that little voice, laugh at it and say &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you cute?It&rsquo;s hard to be critical when you&rsquo;re adorable.&rdquo;</p><h3> 4. Examine it Before You Swallow It <br/>  </h3><p> Sometimes your doubts might have something to tell you. Maybe there is a new skill you need to learn or a true mistake you can avoid.  How can you tell the difference between legitimate self-doubt and useless insecurity?</p><p> Picture someone tossing you an apple. You don&rsquo;t catch the apple with your teeth, immediately chew it, and swallow it. You catch it in your hand; then you might inspect the apple and decide if you want to eat it. Treat doubts and criticisms like the apple. Don&rsquo;t automatically swallow them. Ask yourself if there is something of value for you here. Create space for curiosity. See what happens. You get to chose whether you take a bite from the apple and internalize the concern or toss it away.</p><h3> 5. Leverage Your People <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most effective tools for dealing with impostor syndrome is simply to focus on the team you serve. They don&rsquo;t really care where you came from, how you got here, whether you have a big house, a small car, good hair, bad hair, or anything else. What they do care about is you you can help them succeed today.</p><p> It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to trip over your own insecurities when you&rsquo;re serving others. This is the reason volunteering is such a powerful experience and why you hear volunteers say they received so much more than they give.</p>",

    "link": "sleep-8-reasons-to-make-shut-eye-a-priority",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Sleep - how much do you get?</p><p> Here's a look at eight reasons to make sleep a priority - no matter how busy you are.</p><h3> 1. Your immune system <br/>  </h3><p> We know that sleep is necessary for a normal functioning immune system. Numerous studies have shown that our immune system works best when we get adequate sleep. In fact, several studies have demonstrated poor responses to vaccines for influenza and hepatitis when subjects were sleep deprived.</p><h3> 2. Memory <br/>  </h3><p> It has been fully demonstrated that sleep is necessary for memory consolidation. Actually, when subjects are allowed a night&rsquo;s sleep after learning new information, they perform much better on testing than those who did not. This pertains to factual memory, also referred to as declarative memory, as well as procedural memory such as learning to ride a bike or swing a golf club.</p><h3> 3. Your emotional well-being <br/>  </h3><p> We know that chronically sleep deprived individuals have a much higher incidence of anxiety disorders and depression. This is probably due to sleep&rsquo;s critical role in emotional processing which appears to mainly take place during REM (dream sleep) but is by no means only confined to this stage of sleep.</p><h3> 4. Brain health <br/>  </h3><p> As I point out in my book Sleep Soundly Every Night, Feel Fantastic Every Day, it is during sleep that our brain performs several regenerative processes. The method of neuroplasticity, where the brain forms new pathways and connections, is very much sleep dependent. Additionally, housekeeping chores such as clearing out various neurotoxins that build up during the day occur at a rate ten times greater during sleep.</p><h3> 5. Tissue repair and growth <br/>  </h3><p> It is during sleep that we produce most of our growth hormone. In fact, this production is most closely linked to deep or slow wave sleep. In children, this is intimately linked with their growth. In adults, it is very important in tissue repair. If you are a body builder or an athlete, it is crucial to get enough sleep to allow your musculoskeletal system to restore itself.</p><h3> 6. Your blood sugar <br/>  </h3><p> We know that sleep deprived individuals have a higher incidence of diabetes. This is because sleep deprivation leads to insulin resistance. As a result, insulin is unable to get into cells and exert its influence. In recent papers, the American Diabetes Association has been stressing the importance of sleep in preventing and treating diabetes.</p><h3> 7. Weight</h3><p> Want to reduce that waistline? Get seven to eight hours of sleep. Insufficient sleep leads to excessive production of a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin is an appetite-promoting hormone. It also impedes the production of leptin, an appetite-suppressing hormone.</p><h3> 8. Your lifespan <br/>  </h3><p> Study after study has shown that those of us who chronically sleep less than seven hours do not live as long. We are far more likely to develop hypertension, strokes, and heart attacks. As a result, we have a shorter lifespan.</p><p> What is the take home message? We need to make sleep a priority. Unfortunately, some in our society consider sleep to be a waste of time. In reality, just the opposite is true. Sleep is necessary for our emotional and physical well-being, and there is no substitute.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The decision to start a business blog is a no-brainer once you&rsquo;ve allocated the resources to do so. <br/>  </h3><p> The more challenging task is figuring out how to create a successful blog that people actually read and how to make an existing blog more efficient in terms of converting leads into sales.</p><p> This week, we answer all of your most pressing questions pertaining to the art of business blogging.</p><p> From there, you can choose to implement what you&rsquo;ve learned in-house or request assistance from our team of digital marketing experts.</p><h3> 7 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Starting a Blog <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. What Should My Blog Goals Be? <br/>  </h3><p> A business blog sucks up time, effort, energy, and capital. Before you start throwing money at the monster, you&rsquo;d better have it on a leash and grounded with a sane strategy. Think of blogging as a journey; before embarking, you&rsquo;ll need a map, an itinerary, and a schedule. Market and topic research is the proverbial equivalent of &ldquo;packing your bags.&rdquo; Before you leave the driveway, set realistic expectations for what you hope to achieve with this trip.</p><p> Keep in mind blogs are not about direct selling. Huffington Post&rsquo;s Danny Wong suggests the following goals:</p><p> &ndash; Tell visual stories worth sharing</p><p> &ndash; Express brand identity</p><p> &ndash; Build an email list through great content</p><p> &ndash; Attract top industry talent</p><p> &ndash; Give partners a behind-the-scenes look</p><p> &ndash; Become an industry thought leader</p><p> &ndash; Connect personally with fans</p><p> &ndash; Capture media attention</p><p> &ndash; Analyze your own data</p><p> &ndash; Facilitate word-of-mouth marketing</p><p> &ndash; Distinguish yourself from the competition</p><p> Of course, you also want to set more tangible,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.b2binboundmarketer.com/inbound-marketing-blog/10-essential-smart-goals-for-online-lead-generation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   S.M.A.R.T. goals   </a> </u> for yourself, whether it&rsquo;s to hit an email click-through rate of 10% or get 10 new customers from your blog this month. Mod Girl Marketing has experience working with businesses to improve results. We&rsquo;ll dig into analytical data to measure where you are now and conduct market research to determine what results you can expect given your particular industry. Together, we&rsquo;ll put together measurable metrics for charting the progress and efficiency of your blog in ways that matter to your bottom line!</p><h3> 2. How Can I Find Out Who Wants To Read My Blog? <br/>  </h3><p> There are many tools to help you identify who is reading blogs similar to yours, but we like to use Sprout Social and Raven Tools Using these interfaces, we can monitor what people are buzzing about on social media, conduct surveys, keep a pulse on the competition, search for online mentions of your brand, and gather demographic data on readers and buyers. Buffer Social has a fantastic post on how to use other tools like  <a href=\"https://en.mention.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mention </a>  and  <a href=\"http://crowdriff.com/riffle/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Riffle </a>  to build and cultivate a healthy blog audience. If you&rsquo;re interested in ways to connect with more readers, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to check out my  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Arsenal of Online Resources  </a> as well.</p><h3> 3. How Often Do I Need To Post? <br/>  </h3><p> We can&rsquo;t all be like  <a href=\"http://mashable.com/people/petecashmore/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mashable&rsquo;s Pete Cashmore  </a> who would post one to five new articles each day, but the good news is: we don&rsquo;t have to be!  In a survey,  <a href=\"http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/07/28/you-must-post-every-day-on-your-blog-misconceptions-new-bloggers-have-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ProBlogger found </a>  that the top reason people unsubscribed from their blog was that they were &ldquo;posting too frequently.&rdquo; The keys to building a successful business blog have less to do with frequency and routine, and more to do with value, persistence and consistency.</p><p> NY Times best-selling author  <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/my-new-blogging-frequency.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Michael Hyatt  </a> suggests the sweet spot is about twice per week (one blog on Monday and one blog on Friday.) His readers explained they just didn&rsquo;t have the time to keep up with much more than that. They wanted more time to digest each blog and believed the blog post quality would be better if published less frequently.</p><p> To stay fresh and relevant, you can supplement longer blog entries with daily social media interactions and media like quotes, links, videos, photos, or podcasts &mdash; which brings us to the question of post length.</p><h3> 4. How Long Does It Have To Be? <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re Seth Godin or David Vandagriff &mdash; and your audience demands it &mdash; you can get away with 66-word posts. However, for the rest of the world, longer is usually better. When we say &ldquo;longer,&rdquo; we mean about 1,500 words or more. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><p> &ndash; Longer posts hit the Top 10 ratings of search engines.</p><p> <img alt=\"Average Content Length of Blog Post\" src=\"http://assets.entrepreneur.com/article/1399675352_2-why-should-create-long-form-content-how-do-it.jpg\"/></p><p> &ndash; Longer posts encourage people to spend more time on your site and develops more trust.</p><p> Entrepreneur Magazine noted that people stayed on the page 40% longer and looked at 25% more pages on the site when they were introduced to a longer page of copy.</p><p> &ndash; Longer posts get more backlinks. </p><p> &ndash; Longer posts get more shares. </p><p> For instance, Quick Sprout writer Neil Patel notes that all his posts with more than 1,500 words receive 68% more tweets and 22% more Facebook likes than his shorter articles. He shares this graphic from an online journal that shows the correlation between word count and social shares:</p><p> Naturally, quality trumps quantity every time. Not every post needs to be a massive tomb of information. Mod Girl Marketing doesn&rsquo;t support a one-size-fits-all approach to blogging. We say it really all depends on your industry, your audience, and your topic. That said, our bloggers&rsquo; word counts do tend to air on the heavy side for the most part.</p><p> A word to the wise: If you&rsquo;re not a trained writer or comfortable with writing, you don&rsquo;t want to attempt the feat of a 2,000+ word post. Bloated, repetitive pieces aren&rsquo;t going to hit your goals or engage your readers. It may also take you more time than it&rsquo;s worth. You want to make the best use of your talents &mdash; and, in some cases, this means outsourcing your blog writing to someone who can crank out quality copy much faster and better.</p><h3> 5. What Should I Post? <br/>  </h3><p> Ah, the million-dollar question! If you&rsquo;ve ever found yourself staring at a blank WordPress entry, you are not alone! It happens to the best of us. That&rsquo;s why spending a few hours brainstorming and devising an organized posting schedule for the month is essential to the success of your business blog. When working with clients, Mod Girl Marketing networks closely with a point person within each company to ensure the blog topics are on-point. We have some clients who like to jot down notes for us to incorporate &mdash; in more poetic and expanded ways, of course!</p><p> Everyone wants that one big viral sensation, but in the long run, useful content always outperforms. As Entrepreneur Magazine notes, the most linked-to article on ProBlogger is &ldquo;What is RSS?&rdquo; and the most linked-to article on GetRichSlowly is on high-yield savings accounts. There are many ways to determine which type of content is most useful to your target audience, but the best way is to conduct market research &mdash; one of our specialties at Mod Girl Marketing.</p><p> Using  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.modgirlmarketing.com/top-12-best-digital-marketing-tools-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   digital marketing tools  </a> </u> , we examine what keywords people are typing into the search engines to find businesses like yours and make online purchases. If you have an existing blog, we look at which topics have performed the best for you. We look at which topics are performing particularly well among your competition and what&rsquo;s trending in your industry right now. We examine your website, your products and your services to identify areas where consumers may want or need more information before conducting business with you. To develop a solid blogging strategy, we usually devise core categories to focus upon, create a blog calendar of specific posts, write according to schedule, and track your progress.</p><p> To get to thinking, check out Amanda Gallucci at iAcquire&rsquo;s great rundown of  <a href=\"http://www.iacquire.com/blog/31-types-of-content-for-every-day-of-the-month\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  31 blog post starters </a>  &ndash; From &ldquo;How To&rdquo; guides and product reviews, to imaginative stories and beginner tips.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> For decades, the gold standard for portfolio construction has been rooted in mean-variance optimization and modern portfolio theory (MPT). <br/>  </h3><p> Starting with a few asset class inputs (mean historical return, standard deviation and correlation), this process produces a series of (allegedly) efficient portfolios that maximize expected return at a given risk level.</p><p> Like any widely-accepted standard, this approach has many benefits. It&rsquo;s familiar, widely-taught and scalable. And when it comes to marketing firepower, what&rsquo;s better than attaching your firm&rsquo;s approach to a Nobel Laureate? (More on this later.)</p><p> To put it mildly, traditional portfolio construction has been challenged many times in the past 50 years. Financial markets have experienced drawdowns of a magnitude and frequency that MPT-based models would not have expected. And diversification has shown its tendency to vanish when it&rsquo;s needed the most.</p><p> Even Dr. Markowitz Agrees. During the chaos of 2008, traditional diversification methods and modern portfolio theory became everyone&rsquo;s favorite scapegoat. Everything we were told about what to expect from our portfolios seemed to have been turned on its head.</p><p> Dr. Harry Markowitz (Nobel Prize-winning father of MPT) addressed these reactions in a number of public forums, including an interview with Research Magazine in August, 2011 where he said:</p><p> &ldquo;We believe that a financial advisor will use the risk-return tradeoff curve of modern portfolio theory more effectively if the advisor knows, in general, the assumptions behind MPT&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;While it is true that the well-advised investor may encounter unanticipated hardships, the ill-advised investor courts almost certain disaster.&rdquo;</p><h3> So What&rsquo;s the Problem? <br/>  </h3><p> This approach of building &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; portfolios falls short in three ways:</p><p> <strong>  1. Simplifying Assumptions </strong></p><p> Asset allocation models and traditional measures of risk (like standard deviation) are rooted in many false assumptions.</p><p> They treat upside and downside risk equally which is completely divorced from investor reality and causes an over-approximation of the incremental reward for additional risk.</p><p> They also assume that security returns and volatility follow constant probability distributions, meaning that there is always an equal likelihood of a positive or negative returns, regardless of recent history. In fact, security returns evidence serial correlation, in that positive (negative) returns are more likely to follow positive (negative) returns.</p><p> But the most egregious (and surprisingly, the most well-known) flaw in MPT models is the assumption that security returns follow a normal distribution. By now, I think we all know that this is not the case at all.</p><p> <strong>  2. Reliance on History </strong></p><p> When models rely on historical inputs and assumptions, their outputs are 100% contingent on one thing being true&mdash;that the future will look like the past.</p><p> And herein lies the problem. Financial markets are complex systems. Advances in mathematics and logical analysis now allow us to appreciate that:</p><p> Markets are often unpredictable and subject to large events.</p><p> They respond to both bottom up and top down influences in a non-additive form.</p><p> Markets produce amazing novelty: some good &amp; some bad.</p><p> Complex systems do not behave in a predictable, stable manner. MPT models assume that asset classes will perform at their average long term returns (ignoring the path of returns) and that the relationships among asset classes will remain historically accurate. Neither are true.</p><p> In the words of Dr. Markowitz, &ldquo;&hellip;the inputs to an MPT analysis are not supposed to be historical average returns, volatilities and correlations.  Rather, they should be forward-looking estimates.&rdquo; (Research Magazine, August 2011)</p><p> As they say, history doesn&rsquo;t repeat itself but it often rhymes.</p><p> <strong>  3. Arbitrary Constraints </strong></p><p> Anyone that has gone through a mean-variance optimization exercise can attest that the outputs can sometimes appear odd, often suggesting an allocation that appears anything but &ldquo;diversified.&rdquo;</p><p> Optimizers commonly allocate too heavily to high return asset classes (e.g. emerging markets) or low volatility assets (e.g. real estate) And based on the average annual returns, standard deviation and correlations input, these would have been the optimal weighting if you could go back 30 years in time.</p><p> But no advisor will recommend that clients allocate 40% to emerging markets or 80% in real estate. Instead, practitioners apply arbitrary asset class constraints to produce a result that&rsquo;s palatable to clients. Is the result an &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; portfolio? Possibly, but most likely it is not.</p><p> These points should not be dismissed as benign or academic. They are meaningful. Simplifying assumptions, unreliability of historical data and arbitrary constraints result in an underestimation of risk and results in portfolios that are at worst inefficient, with expected results that are surely unknown without hindsight.</p><h3> An Alternative Premise? <br/>  </h3><p> Of course, diversification is critically important but it&rsquo;s not the destination. Maybe portfolio efficiency is the wrong goal. Maybe instead of efficiency we should be aiming for resiliency.</p><p> In a future article we will address this notion of portfolio resiliency and share our take on why we believe it to be a far superior destination for asset allocators.</p><p> NOTE: The information and investment results stated herein are hypothetical and dependent upon the assumptions and conditions indicated, which may be superseded by actual market events or other unforeseen and unforeseeable intervening causes.

    "content": "<h3> When was the last time you asked yourself &ldquo;What If&rdquo; without your Fear of Regret leading the conversation? <br/>  </h3><p> What if I make a mistake?</p><p> What if this is the wrong choice?</p><p> What if I give up?</p><p> What if I stay the course?</p><p> Regret is a powerful force that can either have you stay with a status quo that&rsquo;s not serving you, or propel you to make the leap into an unknown and unpromised future.</p><p> Come on. Letting the possibility of regret run your show? You deserve more. In fact, I&rsquo;ll bet you crave more.</p><h3> What Do You Crave? <br/>  </h3><p> To be seen.</p><p> Known.</p><p> Loved.</p><p> Respected.</p><p> Challenged.</p><p> Engaged.</p><p> Constant fear of a bad choice and regret won&rsquo;t give you any of those things.</p><h3> At One Time or Another, Almost Everyone Feels Stuck <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s that feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself if I choose Option A and Option B was the better choice.&rdquo; Most of the time the story ends with people staying put, sticking things out, telling themselves that what they need is more time. What they really need is to let go of that darn fear of regret.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not only fear of an unknown future the keeps you put but fear that you&rsquo;ll regret missing out on something that happens where you&rsquo;re currently planted.</p><p> What if you quit a day too soon? A week? A month?</p><p> Talk about pressure! No wonder being deeply and totally stuck is such a common experience.</p><h3> Choosing Change Without Fear of Regret <br/>  </h3><p> My husband came to me four years ago and shared a potential work opportunity that would take us from our safe suburban environment around the world. We didn&rsquo;t labor over the decision and ruminate on the endless ways we could regret the move. We thought it through and opened ourselves to the call for adventure, a broader world view and friends and family thought we&rsquo;d lost our minds.</p><p> Suddenly other people&rsquo;s fears were being piled on me. They weren&rsquo;t mine, yet I was drowning in them.</p><p> What if you hate it?</p><p> What if it&rsquo;s awful?</p><p> What if the violence is out of control?</p><p> What if your house is awful?</p><p> On and on.</p><p> Easy. We&rsquo;d make another choice and come home. Little in this world is permanent.</p><p> That&rsquo;s when they stared at me like I had three heads. They also would bite their lip and give me a look like &ldquo;Okay, lady. Have it your way but I know better.&rdquo;</p><p> Turned out that they didn&rsquo;t.</p><h3> Change: It&rsquo;s All in Your Perspective <br/>  </h3><p> Your attitude towards change has a heck of a lot to do with  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/big-and-scary-is-all-in-your-perspective/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  your perspective </a> .</p><p> My friends were looking while holding the perspective of &ldquo;things go wrong&rdquo; while I was holding the perspective of &ldquo;things go right.&rdquo;</p><p> Perspective is your POV, your way of seeing. Until it shifts, you won&rsquo;t make the leap.</p><h3> Shift Your Perspective Using This Mental Trick to Embrace Change <br/>  </h3><p> Think about the kinds of what if questions that you typically ask yourself when you feel the pull of change. You know, pondering if you should change jobs,  <a href=\"http://breaktheframe.com/before-you-quit-your-biz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  give up your business </a> , end a relationship or move around the world, etc.</p><p> Now, imagine a tennis court.</p><p> You&rsquo;re on the left-hand side = fear of regret.</p><p> I&rsquo;m inviting you to walk to the right side of the court = can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p><p> Walk there in your mind&rsquo;s eye or physically get up and move to the other side of the room.</p><p> Good. Take a moment to feel into this new side of the court. How would you feel if you can&rsquo;t go wrong?</p><p> Free.</p><p> Empowered.</p><p> Lighter.</p><p> Adventurous.</p><p> Creative.</p><p> Now you ________________________.</p><h3> From this place, I&rsquo;ve got a couple new what ifs for you to ponder: <br/>  </h3><p> What if you are exactly where you need to be?</p><p> What if your next move, whatever you choose, is precisely the right one?</p><p> Whenever you find yourself looking at your life and leadership from the left side of the court, you can move on over to the right. Let go of the fear of regret; change.</p>",

    "link": "do-you-know-what-to-do-or-say-when-facing-a-client-in-grief-or-transition",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p><strong>It is inevitable. As a professional with long-term clients, soon or later you will be face-to-face with a client in grief or transition. What do you do? What do you say?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find yourself at a loss for words, you are not alone. There has never been a financial advisor&rsquo;s guide that explains what to say (or what not to say) and how to handle these potentially challenging and professionally awkward situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I became a 25-year-old widow with a 7-month-old baby boy, believe me, no one knew the right thing to do or say around me, including the financial professionals I needed to rely on. And I&rsquo;ve heard the same stories countless times since then, from more than 2000 grieving people. Instead, what most professionals do is either ignore the painful reality and stick to business, or pick up what other people say and inadvertently perpetuate the mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can do better than that. You can learn to do the right things and offer genuine comfort and support, no matter what your clients go through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is never a good idea to say &ldquo;I know how you feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;I understand just what you&rsquo;re going through&rdquo; because you don&rsquo;t. You are always wrong, and you will alienate your client immediately. What professionals often say instead is &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;re going through.&rdquo; That is better, and in the past, I have endorsed that phrase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as I continue to get feedback from research and in my support groups, I find that many grieving people don&rsquo;t appreciate it. They especially resent it when, as sometimes happens, the words are dripping with drama &ndash; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t IMAGINE what this is like for you!&rdquo; Yet even if you take care not to go over the top when you say it, you risk isolating people. They hear your implication that they are so crazy or outside the realm of normalcy that no one else can even imagine what it&rsquo;s like. And since no one can imagine it, no one can be there and help. It builds a moat around your grieving client that can&rsquo;t be crossed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, it ultimately is not true. We have very active emotional imaginations. Most of us can indeed imagine something of the pain and loss, the empty chair, the unanswered phone. In fact, imagining it is one key to building empathy, which is core to who we are as human beings and serves a crucial function in binding us together in mutually helpful ways.<br />\r\nSo if you aren&rsquo;t supposed to say &ldquo;I know how you feel&rdquo; or &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;re going through&rdquo;, what do you say instead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consider asking one of the following questions, modified for the situation if necessary: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to imagine what you&rsquo;re going through &ndash; would you like to tell me?&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&quot;I think if my child died, my body would actually hurt and I&rsquo;d wonder whether I could trust the view I&rsquo;ve always had of life. Is it anything like that, or what is your experience?&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;You probably have people telling you that they can&rsquo;t imagine what you&rsquo;re going through. If you could enter their imaginations and tell them, what would you want them to know?&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Never assume you know what someone else is experiencing.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, ask open-ended questions and allow a grieving client to tell you, and then let your imagination take you as close as possible. That allows you to respond more effectively and serve your clients in ways others don&rsquo;t know how to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you know how to walk your clients through the toughest times of life, you build trust, loyalty, and referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/five-steps-to-serving-widowed-women\">Five Steps to Serving Widowed Women</a></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ENVintel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blake Wood  </u> </a> , SVP of Product Management | <a href=\"http://www.envestnet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Envestnet  </u> </a></p><h3> Advisors face a common dilemma: managing assets to meet a client&rsquo;s stated risk tolerance with full knowledge that other assets exist that are &ldquo;held away&rdquo;, which are defined as accounts not actively managed by an advisor or custodian affiliated with the advisor's financial institution. </h3><p> <br/> For example, suppose a client has placed $1 Million with an advisor to meet a future capital accumulation goal in 10 years, and is comfortable with only a moderate level of risk.  Given the time constraint, reaching the goal may be a stretch, unless the client either extends the time period or assumes more risk than is prudent. However, further suppose that the advisor is aware of an additional $1 Million pool of client assets held away.  Theoretically, the risk tolerance on a combined portfolio of $2 Million could remain consistent with the client&rsquo;s original risk tolerance, all things being equal, and the future capital goal could be achieved within the client&rsquo;s stated time frame, given that there are more investible assets to work with.  However, FINRA 2111(The &lsquo;suitability&rsquo; rule) says the dually registered advisors, acting in a registered representative capacity with the  broker dealer must have a reasonable basis to believe that a transaction is suitable for a client, based, in part, on the client&rsquo;s profile.  That profile may include other investments which may not be managed by the advisor. Furthermore, those assets held away may directly affect the client&rsquo;s overall risk tolerance, rather than only those assets under advisement.  It can create a conundrum:  how to access information pertaining to all assets (not just the ones under the advisor&rsquo;s purview) to make prudent recommendations and adhere to the best interest of the client.</p><h3> <strong>  Simple Goal.  Complex Execution </strong></h3><p> <br/> The Unified Managed Household (UMH) was intended to help solve that problem.  Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t deliver on the promise.  It was a good idea:  a way to aggregate accounts that cannot be combined, perhaps for tax reasons, and still offer advice on their merits in an asset allocation.  The underlying technology was the key, and unfortunately, it frequently got stuck in the weeds&mdash;focusing on the reporting function&mdash;rather than streamlining portfolio management.  What was missing was deep integration with the advisor platform to allow viewing of and reporting on all assets.</p><p> Some drawbacks are apparent.  For instance, account data required to structure a comprehensive investment strategy can be different depending on the platform on which the account is housed, and thus may require manual rebalancing across different account registrations.  Another obstacle is software limitations (once the transfer of account information is completed) when attempting to align it with a client&rsquo;s goals.</p><p> In addition, a fully integrated plan mandates that capital markets assumptions be synchronized across all accounts.  Assumptions on rates of return, for example, need to be applied consistently to various asset classes.</p><h3> <strong>  Driving Value Through Simplicity </strong></h3><p> <br/> From a client&rsquo;s perspective, the technology solution also needs to be engaging, and needs to both educate and communicate. It should have core functionality that lets the client toggle different assumptions and see projected results.  For example, some clients may be reluctant to bother the advisor with what could be construed as a na&iuml;ve question, such as modifying risk tolerance or reducing investment dollars in a given year.  Giving a client the opportunity to play with these &ldquo;what if&rdquo; options, as well as to revise different retirement dates and investment returns to determine a projected income stream, is key.  Add in the ability for the client to see all accounts on a single page:  a total plan, with all investments, in real time.</p><p> The right technology also can make the advisor&rsquo;s life easier, certainly with respect to reporting.  Ideally, the advisor wants to generate customized reports with various bells and whistles, and deliver them either electronically or in print form.  Many advisors are burdened with the time-consuming task of generating reports, and most would welcome being able to create and save compliance approved templates to deliver future reports seamlessly.</p><p> Other things may be on an advisor&rsquo;s wish list.  Beginning with the paperless onboarding process, and extending through investment selection, trading, and rebalancing, all information should be accurate, recent, retrievable and comprehensive, thus reducing the notoriously complex compliance requirements. Second, all assets (no matter where they are held), need to be centralized, so the advisor can have available the detailed information needed to adhere to regulatory standards. ,</p><p> And because every advisor must accommodate clients by managing smaller, unprofitable accounts from time to time within the framework of a larger relationship, technology needs to make that task easier and more efficient.  Frequently, those accounts are owned by younger clients, who use products and services differently from their parents&rsquo; generation, and they want their advisor to be on the cutting edge of new technology.  Whether it&rsquo;s a new app, product extension, or information resource, the way it&rsquo;s delivered can go a long way to build and cement a loyal and lasting advisory relationship. </p><h3> <strong>  An Integrated Solution </strong></h3><p> <br/> In the past, planning and investment implementation were two parts to the whole.  The process required two separate platforms, and was cumbersome and inefficient.  Today&rsquo;s technology can integrate both planning and investing, and promises true operational efficiencies and clear client communication.</p><p> Clients and advisors alike now can access sophisticated technology with tools to structure the portfolio and make ongoing adjustments in response to changing capital markets conditions. Core functionality means modifications can be synchronized across all accounts, making it relatively simple to examine and address goals, cash flows, and tax planning guidelines.  It translates to one-stop shopping for advisors, thereby negating the need for multiple research and information portals to design an array of options.  Regular releases that deliver new enhancements keep advisors current and offer their clients a range of capabilities under a single, user-friendly platform.</p><h3> <strong>  Leverage and Scale Drive Value </strong></h3><p> <br/> Advisors need a forward looking and innovative business model to drive a higher practice value and deliver a better service product to their clients.  Letting technology do the work of integrating accounts and searching for data means advisors are free to focus on what counts: serving their clients, and doing it better.  That&rsquo;s the way to drive value.</p><p> <strong>  Learn more about us  <a href=\"http://www.envestnet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    here   </u>  </a>  . </strong></p>",

Is it internal staff? Advisors or consultants? End investors? Knowing your audience will help you with the right tone, content, degree of complexity, etc.</li><li> Research the topic and gather background materials related to the topic and/or the SME you&rsquo;re interviewing. You want to ask intelligent questions, be conversant in the topic and be able to probe smartly during the interview</li><li> Once you figure out what kind of insights and information you want from the SME, you can devise questions accordingly. Don&rsquo;t ask more than you need to, be clear and precise when formulating your questions, and give the questions in advance (if possible) to the SME so they can prepare and provide thoughtful, useful answers <br/>  </li><h3> During the interview <br/>  </h3><p> It can be intimidating at times to interview a &ldquo;power player&rdquo; at your company. Here are some tips to handle the task:</p><li> Be relaxed and confident, speak clearly and give your SME time to think about their responses</li><li> Take good notes and, if you&rsquo;re doing a phone call, consider recording the conversation and getting a written transcript. This is a great safety net in case you either missed something in your notes or wrote things down inaccurately. Also, if there was something you didn&rsquo;t quite understand, you can review the transcript to help you make sense of the answers</li><li> Get all the information you need and allow your SME the chance to &ldquo;go off script&rdquo; and offer additional insights they believe could be helpful. Stay focused and respect the SME&rsquo;s time <br/>  </li><h3> After the interview <br/>  </h3><li> Establish post-interview lines of communication. Ask if you can follow up with the SME if required, and invite the SME to share other thoughts or relevant materials if they think of something after the interview</li><li> It&rsquo;s generally a good idea to share your draft article (or at least the quotes you intend to use) so the SME can make corrections or clarify certain points <br/>  </li><p> It&rsquo;s a big responsibility to interview a SME and create an article that best conveys the insights you&rsquo;ve gathered. With good preparation and interview protocol, you&rsquo;ll be on your way to doing a great job.</p>",

You can use the morning hours to either get a necessary task done before the day even really starts or you can partake in another activity that will help ensure your mental, physical or emotional welfare for the coming day by eating a good breakfast, meditating, reading, writing, etc.</p><p> <strong>  How to become a morning person: </strong></p><li> Sleep early and stay consistent about sleeping at a reasonable hour.</li><li> Have all of the following items done before going to bed: <li>  All your bags packed and ready to go for the next day so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything besides pick it/them up on the way out of the house. </li> <li>  The clothes you want to wear the next day should be decided and laid out so you can just put them on after you brush your teeth or shower. </li> <li>  What you want to eat for breakfast (I recommend eating breakfast to help create lasting energy for the day). </li> <li>  A thought out plan for what your morning will consist of. </li></li><li> As soon as you open your eyes, JUMP out of bed and do something active like 5 pushups or 10 jumping jacks. What this does is it gets your energy flowing and literally forces your body to wake up without giving your mind a chance to come in and convince you to sleep for those five extra minutes.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t waste any time before you get your day started. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Habit: Physical Stimulation/Exercise </strong></h3><p> <br/> Looking good and feeling more confident about your physical attraction are just a few of the incidental benefits of exercising. When you give your body the physical stimulation that it craves, your body literally rewards you with happiness in the form of endorphins. Creating this beautiful reciprocal relationship with your body is one of the keys to success.</p><p> <strong>  How to begin an exercise regimen: </strong></p><li> Think deeply about the type of body you want. Do you just want to lose weight? Are you trying to put on muscle? Do you want to tone up?</li><li> Do some research about different activities that will get you the results you crave.</li><li> Determine which of the activities that will help push you towards your goal body seem the most fun to you. Which of these activities do you genuinely think you will enjoy?</li><li> Set aside a specific time in your schedule to engage in the physical activities you choose and try to the greatest extent possible to remain consistent about the times you dedicate towards your physical well being. After a few weeks, your body will be ready for physical activity at the time you ordinarily exercise.</li><li> If you see that your physical activity is starting to feel more like a burden than an enjoyable time of the day, switch it up! Go back to the drawing board and think about different ways to exercise that sound fun and appealing to try. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Habit: Eating Healthier </strong></h3><p> <br/> To operate at maximum productive capacity, you need to have maximum energy levels. Begin paying attention to how your body responds to the different foods you eat and you&rsquo;ll quickly understand the importance of not over-eating and eating nutritious foods that fuel your body with clean energy. You&rsquo;re not dieting, you&rsquo;re just cleaning up your diet.</p><p> <strong>  How to clean up your diet: </strong></p><li> Our junk food intake has to be at a minimum and the easiest way to ensure that happens is by simply not buying soda, chips, chocolate, candy, etc. for your home. Keeping your home clean of junk will help keep your diet clean.</li><li> Try to eat bread and other carbohydrates earlier in the day rather than during dinner and as part of late night snacks.</li><li> Water, water and more water. Water helps keeps you full and fresh. Dehydration manifests in pretty subtle yet aggravating symptoms.</li><li> No matter what the rest of your diet looks like, make sure to eat vegetables and fruits. For your body to operate at its maximum possible potential it needs a strong immune system along with nutrients required to ensure its health and energy. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Habit: Meditating </strong></h3><p> <br/> All day long our minds are racing at 100 mph and most of the time we&rsquo;re not even aware of it. We don&rsquo;t ordinarily think about our thoughts as events that require energy, but every thought that we have requires a certain amount of energy. The thoughts that we really identify with strongly and force us into imagination drain us. Meditation helps patch up the leaking of energy caused by the neuroticism of our minds.</p><p> <strong>  How to implement meditation into your life: </strong></p><li> Full body stretch for 2-3 minutes.</li><li> Sit comfortably in a chair or cross-legged on a pillow on the floor. If you&rsquo;re on the floor, try to sit on the edge of the pillow so you&rsquo;re leaning forward towards your knees as opposed to your back to ensure no pressure on your spine.</li><li> Close your eyes and try to follow your breath. Become aware of the fact that it is taking lace. Your mind will begin talking immediately and all you have to do is see it. It&rsquo;s not about controlling what the mind is saying, you&rsquo;ll quickly realize you can&rsquo;t do that. The point is to simply be aware of what is taking place and come back to your breath when you are taken by the flow of thoughts. <br/>  </li><p> The habits discussed are meant to prepare your body, mind and heart for whatever they&rsquo;ll each be faced with throughout the day. Remember, you are your habits. If on a daily basis you eat a bunch of junk, disrespect your body by failing to providing it with the physical stimulation it needs, and allow your thoughts to run your day, you cannot possibly operate at your maximum potential.</p><p> Just like you need to take care of your car with oil, gas, water, and good breaks to run perfectly, your body, mind and heart need you to take care of them.</p><p> Note on the importance of an accountability partner:</p><p> Why is it so much easier to go to the gym when you have a trainer? Why does it motivate you to work hard when the people around you work harder than you?</p><p> Having someone to help make sure you stick to your goals is one of the keys to changing your habits. When you and another individual make a commitment to keep each other in check, you not only have someone that is counting on you to help them progress, but they&rsquo;re there for you every step of the way helping you through the struggle.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"/category/ideas/insights\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Partners In Grind  </a> </u>  is a free tool that pairs two individuals up who would like to implement the same habit into their lives.

    "link": "a-new-approach-to-tax-planning-with-iovas",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Despite low yields and ongoing volatility, many advisors have a strategy to help their clients manage the market and earn meaningful gains in 2016. But another hurdle approaches on April 15th as tax bills come due. Taxes can be your clients&rsquo; single biggest investment expense&mdash;especially for the high net worth, who can face rates as high as 40 percent or even 50 percent, when Federal and State taxes are combined.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why tax deferral is key. According to surveys by Jefferson National, 96 percent of RIAs and fee-based advisors say tax deferral is important. Yet, less than 20 percent know tax deferral can potentially add 100 bps or more to a portfolio. And more than half said clients have no knowledge about tax deferral beyond 401(k)s and IRAs. Many are missing opportunities to maximize wealth.</p><h3> <strong>  IOVAs: Built for Tax-Advantaged Investing </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first step is investing in qualified plans. But the high net worth can max out low contribution limits. Now a new category of Investment-Only Variable Annuities (IOVAs) can maximize the power of tax deferral with low fees, or even flat-fees, no commissions, and no surrender charges. With an expanded lineup of underlying funds, including more liquid alternatives, low-cost IOVAs can be used for a range of tax-advantaged investing strategies:</p><h3> <strong>  Asset Location </strong></h3><p> <br/> Research shows asset location can potentially increase returns by 100 bps or more&mdash;without increasing risk. In taxable accounts, locate tax-efficient investments taxed at lower long term capital gains rates, including buy and hold equities and ETFs. In low-cost IOVAs, locate tax-inefficient investments taxed at higher rates for short term capital gains and ordinary income, including fixed income, REITS, actively managed strategies and liquid alternatives&mdash;preserving upside without the drag of taxes.</p><h3> <strong>  Tax-Efficient Re-Balancing </strong></h3><p> <br/> Inside low-cost IOVAs, investment income or capital gains remain untaxed. When re-balancing means taking gains, avoid taxes inside an IOVA. When re-balancing means taking a loss, take it in taxable accounts and use for tax loss harvesting.</p><h3> <strong>  Building Personal Pensions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Defined benefit and pension plans continue disappearing. Use low-cost IOVAs to accumulate more. Strategically diversify income during retirement to minimize &ldquo;bracket creep,&rdquo; using Roth and Traditional IRAs, fixed or immediate annuities and systematic withdrawals from IOVAs. No required minimum distributions means non-qualified IOVAs are especially attractive, offering tax-deferred accumulation beyond age 70&frac12;.</p><h3> <strong>  Preserving a Windfall </strong></h3><p> <br/> When selling a business, optimize the after-tax windfall by building a fully diversified portfolio using asset location with a low-cost IOVA.  If there is no immediate need for liquidity, a low-cost IOVA can be used for the entire windfall.</p><h3> <strong>  Legacy Planning and Wealth Transfer </strong></h3><p> <br/> Trust income over $12,150 is taxed at 39.6 percent&mdash;the highest bracket&mdash;plus 3.8 percent net investment income tax. By funding trusts with low-cost IOVAs, you  control when income is generated and when it&rsquo;s taxed. IOVAs often work best with CRUTS, Credit Shelter, Bypass, Revocable and Special Needs Trusts. Or use non-qualified stretch with low-cost IOVAs to generate a lifetime income stream when wealth is passed to heirs.</p><h3> <strong>  Right Time for IOVAs </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s a direct link between paying less in taxes&mdash;and earning higher returns. That&rsquo;s why tax-planning should be a top priority not just now&mdash;but all year long. And now you can to take a new approach to tax planning using a new category of IOVAs. Offering lower costs, more funds and more flexibility, Investment-Only VAs can be used in ways that traditional VAs can&rsquo;t to help clients minimize taxes and increase returns&mdash;without increasing risk.</p><strong> Important Disclosures:</strong><br/>Variable annuities are investments subject to market fluctuation and risk, including possible loss of principal. Your units, when you make a withdrawal or surrender, may be worth more or less than your original investment.<br/>Variable annuities are long-term investments to help you meet retirement and other long-range goals. Withdrawal of tax-deferred accumulations are subject to ordinary income tax. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 &frac12; may incur a 10% IRS tax penalty. Jefferson National does not offer tax advice. Annuities are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by any bank, nor are they FDIC insured.<p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Attention, says Chris Hayes, the moderator of MSNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;All In&rdquo; program, is the scarcest commodity of the 21st century.</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  True. </strong> In her book &ldquo;Reclaiming Conversation,&rdquo; Sherry Turkle writes eloquently about the differences betweendeep attention and hyper attention. Hyper attention is a fractured attention in which we rapidly zip from one point of focus to the next. You and I know. Googling. Tweeting. Facebooking. Instagramming. Ceaseless distraction. Activities like skimming and scanning are often associated with fractured attention. Popular claims notwithstanding, hyper attention equals diminished retention.</p><p> Maryanne Wolf, a cognitive neuroscientist at Tufts University, thought she was immune to the perils of fractured attention. Sure, she saw evidence of fractured attention in most of her students &ndash; but that was other people! Until Wolf sat down one evening to read a novel by Hermann Hesse, one of her favorite authors, and found it difficult to focus on the book. Alarm bells rang.</p><h3> Like it or not, every one of us is impacted by the onslaught of a hyper-attention culture.</h3><p> <br/> In every business situation, we engage with folks who have diminished attention spans. The time-tested essentials of influential communication become exponentially important in our attention-deficit-world.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s remind ourselves of these business essentials.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Lead with your main message. </strong></h3><p> Unless you&rsquo;re in an explicit brainstorming session, nobody wants to hear you think out loud. Folks long to hear a clear message from you. Don&rsquo;t crawl your way toward your main message as you speak. Get to it in the first sentence. Elaborate afterwards.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Lead with your personal energy. </strong></h3><p> When you speak up in a meeting, speak with energy, the moment you open your mouth. You don&rsquo;t have time for a sentence or two to &ldquo;warm up&rdquo; as you get going. If anything, begin with a little bit of extra energy at the start so my attention shifts from the previous speaker to you.  If your energy doesn&rsquo;t grab me from the start, why the heck should I listen?</p><h3> <strong>  3. Lead with the unexpected. </strong></h3><p> When you speak, grab my attention with a colorful phrase, a succinct metaphor, a compelling analogy. If this does not come easily to you, listen to the pundits that offer commentary on television news shows. As annoying as some of them are &ndash; the good ones have mastered these skills. They grab our attention, from the start, with their choice of language. Study, practice, experiment.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Lead with joy. </strong></h3><p> When you speak with a sense of delight, I want to listen to you. Ditto when you communicate with a sense of joy. Please don&rsquo;t be overly measured as you talk. Don&rsquo;t be pedantic. Above all, please don&rsquo;t be boring. No matter how clever your argument is, I will tune you out.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s the good news about fractured attention.</h3><p> <br/> The techniques just listed will help you harness the attention of your audience. Better yet: After her alarm bells rang, Maryanne Wolf was determined to reclaim her facility for deep attention. Wolf discovered that after 2 weeks of determined focus on the Hesse novel, her ability to immerse herself in deep reading returned. Whew.</p><p> Pay attention to attention. Theirs and yours. There is no personal success without it.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;If I only had a crystal ball.&rdquo; Every investor has probably made this wish from time to time.</h3><p> <br/> We would all like a way to avoid the emotional pain and anxiety that are sure to come when our portfolios lose value due to inevitable market downturns.</p><p> Surely a perfect investment would spare us that pain. Suppose a mutual fund manager with a crystal ball knew which 10% of the 500 largest U. S. stocks would earn the highest returns for each upcoming five-year period. Investing only in those stocks should ensure gain with no pain.</p><p> According to an article by Bob Veres, editor of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bobveres.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Inside Information  </a> </u> , someone has looked back over more than 80 years to track such a hypothetical perfect fund. Alpha Architect, a research company, divided the 500 largest U.S. stocks into deciles and imagined a fund investing in only the 10% known to have the highest returns for the next five years. Beginning January 1, 1927, the hypothetical portfolio was adjusted every five years. If you could have purchased it then and held it to the end of 2009, you would have earned just under 29% a year. Lots of gain, no pain at all, right?</p><p> Except for the particularly bad bear market that started in 1929, when you would have seen your investment plummet 75.96%. Or the one-year period starting at the end of March 1937, when the fund would have fallen more than 44%.</p><p> Or the nine more times over the years that the fund dropped by 20% or more. It lost 22% in 1974 when the S&amp;P 500 was up 20%. In 2000-2001 you&rsquo;d have watched it plummet 34% while the S&amp;P 500 was only down 21%. Or how about the 20% drop from the end of September through the end of November 2002, at a time when the S&amp;P 500 was sailing along with a 15% positive return.</p><p> Yes, the long-term returns in this &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; investment were amazing. The full ride, however, offered many opportunities for anxiety and even terror, when investors would have been strongly tempted to bail.</p><p> Alpha Architect concluded that even if God&mdash;who presumably doesn&rsquo;t need a crystal ball to have perfect foresight&mdash;were running this mutual fund, He would have lost a lot of investors. During the rough patches, many would have lost faith in His management skill.</p><p> Investors who are ultimately successful learn to hang on through thick and thin, knowing that markets eventually recover. Yet even if we could choose a perfect investment,  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/weekly-column/passive-investing-lower-costs-lower-risk-better-returns\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   staying with it for the long term  </a> </u>  is a challenge.</p><p> One of the reasons market declines are so frightening is that they happen much faster than market gains.  <u>  <a href=\"http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2016/02/why-bear-markets-are-so-painful/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ben Carlson  </a> </u> , author of A Wealth of Common Sense: Why Simplicity Trumps Complexity in Any Investment Plan, looked at all the bear markets and bull markets going back to 1928. The bull market rallies averaged 57% returns, while bear markets averaged losses of 24%. The bull markets lasted an average of 474 days. The bear market drops were more intense, compressed into an average of just 232 days before the next upturn.</p><p> Even when, by percentage, the gains far outweigh the losses, the more gradual pace of the bull markets doesn&rsquo;t attract our attention in the same way as the heart-stopping downturns of bear markets.</p><p> Veres calls the Alpha Architect research &ldquo;a lesson in humility and patience.&rdquo; We can&rsquo;t look into the future with a real crystal ball. However, looking back at market patterns with an imaginary one can help us protect ourselves from our own tendency to bail out in the face of adversity.</p>",

These people are not easy to lead!AND&hellip;if you recognise, understand and appreciate the gifts they bring, rebels can be an immensely valuable asset.<h3> <strong>  If you recognise the gifts they bring, rebels can be an immensely valuable asset. </strong></h3><h3> Here are 5 ways to bring out the best in workplace rebels:</h3><strong> 1. Make an effort to consciously recognise rebels in your organisation.</strong>Start to see their value (this blog and the list above should help for starters). If you&rsquo;ve read my post that went viral &ndash; <u> <a href=\"/grow/leadership/weird-is-good-why-dissonance-fosters-innovation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Weird is Good: Why dissonance fosters innovation </a></u> &ndash; you&rsquo;ll know what gems lie in the &lsquo;not so ordinary&rsquo;. Appreciating &lsquo;different-ness&rsquo; and actively seeking to find what strengths lie in divergent thinking is a solid first step.<strong> 2. Accept that, like a finely tuned Ferrari, they might be hard to handle, temperamental and impetuous,</strong>but if you focus on their strengths it can result in a wilder (and more progressive) ride than your Toyota Previa. Specifically, you could spend more time with them understanding their perspective &ndash; get under the hood, get behind the wheel with these rebels. Ask them: where do you see the opportunity in this situation? If this was your organisation, what would you do? What&rsquo;s the idea that would get you fired? (Then peel it back a tad). Get exquisitely familiar with what they are passionate about and see where you can put that to good use.<strong> 3.  <u>  Coach them </u>  on how to channel their passionate,</strong>troublemaker ways in a politically savvy and non-aggressive manner. Help them to learn how to be a &ldquo;good troublemaker&rdquo; #oxymoronoftheday.<strong> 4. Give them a voice.</strong>Identify situations and opportunities where their unconventional attitude might be just the ticket. The cash cow that&rsquo;s about to dive into dog territory? The project that is floundering? The business unit needing a rocket up its proverbial? Let your rebel take a look (with clear boundaries of course).<strong> 5. Get clear (then get them clear) on the difference between skillful challenging and just being a negative pain in the butt. </strong>Focus their development on behaviourally acceptable ways to challenge. This post gives you some tips for starters on how to challenge effectively.<strong> Sidebar:</strong>the rebel to keep is one who still delivers in their role. The rebel to kick to the curb is the one whose performance in their role is consistently sub-par. Unconventional thinking is not an excuse for non-performance.If nothing else, when you strike a rebel in your team, don&rsquo;t immediately dismiss them as a problem child that needs to be &lsquo;managed out&rsquo;. Try to understand them and the gifts they can bring to your organisation.<h3> As Steve Jobs once said&hellip;</h3>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes&hellip; the ones who see things differently &mdash; they&rsquo;re not fond of rules&hellip; You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can&rsquo;t do is ignore them because they change things&hellip; they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.&rdquo;",

Why? Because no matter how much the gender gap is mentioned in political speeches, and no matter how wrong we know the disparity is, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be going away any time soon. According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   American Association of University Women&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  recent report &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Simple Truth About the Gender Pay Gap  </a> </u> ,&rdquo; women earn an average of 79 cents to the dollar compared to men. Women of color and older women fare even worse. In other words, 79 cents is the best-case scenario, and it&rsquo;s a pretty bad starting point.</p><p> When it comes to saving, this earnings gap is magnified. With lower earnings, women have 20% less discretionary income available for saving. Less savings means women are less prepared for retirement, less able to retire as early as men do, and often have less retirement income even when they do stop working. The result: a shorter, less comfortable retirement. It&rsquo;s no wonder women tend to suffer from &ldquo;bag lady syndrome,&rdquo; that less-than-pleasant term for the fear of ending up penniless and homeless. And while it may sound extreme, this fear is very real for far too many women.</p><h3> Of course, the gender gap isn&rsquo;t the only dynamic at play here. </h3><p> <br/> Women&mdash;particularly baby boomers and older&mdash;were raised with the idea that a solid financial &ldquo;plan&rdquo; meant finding a reliable man to provide financial support, and maybe getting a teaching credential just in case. To find a husband, women often spend their limited resources on presentation (clothes, makeup, hair, nails, and more) in hopes of attracting their financial security blanket. While younger women may scoff at the idea, in reality, the myth that men are some sort of financial guardian for women is still alive and well. Perhaps even worse, women tend to hand over the financial reins to their male partners, often hiding their heads in the sand when in comes to money. It&rsquo;s a dangerous way of thinking. It taints our relationship with money, including our ability to be financial grown-ups and a full economic partner. It inhibits our financial confidence, and it limits our ability to take charge of our financial health and close the gender gap once and for all. </p><p> My client Lydia is a great example. When her husband Jim died seven years ago, figuring out how to transfer assets and how to invest the money was the last thing she wanted to deal with. Jim had always handled the money, and she felt lost in this &ldquo;whole new world&rdquo; of financial planning. Jim&rsquo;s stockbroker offered to help by rolling Jim&rsquo;s annuity into a new one. When Lydia signed the agreement, she didn&rsquo;t understand the surrender charges on the new annuity or even what she was signing. The broker played the role of helping the grieving widow well while he captured a hefty commission for himself. Lydia came to me when she sensed she&rsquo;d been betrayed. Luckily, we were able to unwind the transaction, and since then she&rsquo;s become educated and financially empowered. I only wish she&mdash;and many women like her&mdash;had never been in the situation in the first place.</p><p> Whether a woman is married, divorced, widowed, or single, I believe half the battle in closing the gender gap is changing our attitudes about money. The gender pay gap has barely budged in more than a decade, so it&rsquo;s likely to be with us for some time, but here are six ways we women can do our part to help change the game:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Be financially self sufficient in your marriage or any relationship. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I can&rsquo;t tell you how many women I&rsquo;ve worked with who &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; their partners to do right by them and were bitterly disappointed. Take equal responsibility for your financial health. Remember: building your financial future isn&rsquo;t anyone else&rsquo;s job. It&rsquo;s not your husband&rsquo;s job. It&rsquo;s not your advisor&rsquo;s job. It&rsquo;s yours.</p><h3> <strong>  2. If the bottom line goal is to create wealth, make erasing debt your #1 priority. </strong></h3><p> <br/> If bringing home 21 cents less then men for every dollar you earn makes you mad, consider this: If you have $5,000 in credit card debt, you could be paying as much as 40 cents more on every dollar you spend. Consumer debt compounds negatively, drags on your wealth, and strips away your ability to &ldquo;outsave&rdquo; men. Do everything you can to eliminate the debt you have today, and be realistic about spending to be sure it doesn&rsquo;t creep back up in the future.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Invest in yourself. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Make financial choices that increase your earning power. Learn new skills. Get your MBA. Earn a professional certification. (Note: &ldquo;Investing&rdquo; in Botox, designer handbags, and little dogs are not part of this plan!)</p><h3> <strong>  4. Invest early and often to take advantage of compounding. </strong></h3><p> <br/> The more your money has time to grow on its own, the more wealth you&rsquo;ll have to fund your retirement. Start as soon as possible and increase the amount you invest and save each year. If you get a raise, save half of it and spend the rest. </p><h3> <strong>  5. Getting divorced? Hold on to assets that generate long-term wealth.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> While you may feel emotionally attached to your home, a house is not an investment asset. Focus on retirement funds and other savings vehicles that can produce income 20 years down the road.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Maximize your Social Security benefits. </strong></h3><p> <br/> With lower earnings, it may be tempting to start claiming Social Security as soon as you're eligible, but delaying your claim just eight years from age 62 to 70 can increase the value of your benefit by as much as 76%. For women, that pay raise can do wonders in helping support a longer lifespan.</p><p> I hope the gender pay gap will someday become a thing of the past. Until that happens, make it your mission to change the things you can control. Get educated about financial planning, take responsibility for your financial future, and be sure you&rsquo;re on track for a long, happy, healthy retirement.</p>",

    "title": "Should You Be Trusted Just Because You're a Professional?",
    "link": "should-you-be-trusted-just-because-youre-a-professional",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a consumer, a user of professional services myself, <strong>  I&rsquo;m tired of hearing from professionals that they should be trusted just because they are labelled professionals. </strong></p><p> Recently, and for only about the zillionth time, I asked &ldquo;the question&rdquo; that I always ask professionals, and got &ldquo;the answer&rdquo; that I pretty much always get back.  This time though, I WAS the militant consumer, and responded accordingly.</p><p> Picture the scene:  I am seeking professional advice; and am a begrudging consumer.</p><p> Begrudging because this is dealing with the medical world, where you don&rsquo;t actually get to choose your professional, and I didn&rsquo;t want to be there at all.  I am, in these circumstances, the very definition of &ldquo;militant consumer&rdquo;.    That militancy is influenced (for me at least) by the perception that in the medical world the professionals seem to choose amongst themselves to determine who the most appropriate professional is, and do so on the basis of some sort of roster of who is due for the next new Mercedes. However, I digress&hellip;</p><p> So my &ldquo;professional&rdquo; was allocated to me, and all other professionals stood aside and left us to it.  That doesn&rsquo;t help my trust issues to begin with&hellip;</p><p> My newly appointed professional then shakes hands and promptly launches into the giving of recommendations and advice.  We haven&rsquo;t even discussed the weather or how my football team will do this weekend&hellip;just straight into business.   At the very least the professional in this example is guilty of being an utter bore.  My trust levels are not improving.</p><p> As a consumer I am actually miffed that we didn&rsquo;t get to talk about my football team.  Or the weather.  Or some other trite but safe subject to begin with.  I am miffed because I actually need that chit-chat part at the beginning:  it helps me connect and establish some basic understanding and sharing of values.  It enables me to understand the professionals judgement on particular players or strategies &ndash; things that I understand, and which could actually help me form a view as to how the professional thinks, assesses information and delivers opinion.  And that is pertinent to me.</p><p> Anyway, the professional is in full flow and impressing the daylights out of themself with their own cleverness, and blathering in jargon which has already made me begin planning my own funeral mentally (simply because that seems a more enjoyable experience), and I&rsquo;d had enough.  So I asked the question:</p><h3> &ldquo;Why should I do what you say?&rdquo;</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  The response was the classic: &ldquo;because you can trust me. I am a professional&rdquo; </strong></h3><p> <br/> My response was something new I guess:  &ldquo;Yeah, well there are professional thieves, and professional assassins, and professional politicians&hellip;.they&rsquo;re all called professionals and I wouldn&rsquo;t automatically trust one of them.  So why should I trust you?&rdquo;</p><p> The conversation sort of went downhill from there, and we agreed that perhaps some other Mercedes-needing-professionals should be consulted&hellip;and the reason was simply because of the arrogant assumption on the part of the professional involved here that I should just shut up and listen, and take their word as gospel, because they are a member of a &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; profession.  &ldquo;Trusted&rdquo; according to who? 70% of consumers in some statistically invalid survey?  That isn&rsquo;t a strong enough reason for me to place my health, wealth or future in their hands.</p><p> Why do professionals think that they are automatically entitled to &ldquo;Trust&rdquo;?</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the newsflash: we &ndash; the professionals &ndash; are not entitled to be trusted.</p><h3> Trust is earned.</h3><p> <br/> It is not conferred by title.  It is not conferred by technical qualifications either. There are plenty of well credentialed crooks doing time right now.</p><h3> Trust cannot simply be claimed by a professional.  Trust is given to the professional by the client.</h3><p> <br/> That line of thinking might not fit in with a professional&rsquo;s own super-ego position, however to quote Billy Joel:</p><p> <strong>  It's too late to fight  <br/>  It's too late to change me  <br/>  You may be wrong for all I know  <br/>  But you may be right </strong></p><p> The point is that as a consumer I may not be an expert in YOUR professional field, but I am not an idiot either.  And ultimately I want to be in control of my life and my choices.  So YOUR role Mr or Mrs Professional is to help guide and shape my thinking, and the choices that I make.  When we &ndash; the advisers &ndash; are consumers we totally get this, don&rsquo;t we?</p><p> Yet nearly every professional I question regarding their value proposition when we are not the consumer, but are thinking as an adviser only,  comes up with a variation of the same answer:  &ldquo;You should work with me because I am trustworthy. I am a professional&rdquo;</p><h3> You are a professional?  Cool.  Good for you.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean I trust you however.  Not yet.  I will decide whether I do or not in due course&hellip;</h3><p> <br/> The link between being a professional, and that in itself being a trusted position is one which we make.  Consumers will not necessarily make the same link.  Even if they do connect &ldquo;professional&rdquo; with &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo; automatically, that connection is not a compelling reason to choose any particular professional, is it?</p><p> Because if a consumers belief set is &ldquo;professional = trustworthy&rdquo; then a professional claiming trustworthiness is more likely to be treated with suspicion than anything else.  After all, if &ldquo;professional = trustworthy aren&rsquo;t all professionals trustworthy &ndash; including you?  Why would you need to stress the point about me being able to trust you?&rdquo;  The claim actually creates doubt, rather than reinforce trustworthiness.</p><p> Take it from a militant consumer (of some professional services):  Claiming trustworthiness as point of difference does not help a professionals cause.  It is either trite and meaningless because I decide whether you are to be trusted or not, or alternatively it is simply a ticket to the game because all market participants operate at the same ethical level and your claim doesn&rsquo;t separate you from any other professional.</p><p> I believe that professionals can do themselves a massive favour by dropping claims of trustworthiness. Instead, just prove that you can be trusted.   <strong>  Earn it through your actions. </strong></p>",

    "title": "Advisors: Three Concepts to Gain More Client Referrals",
    "link": "advisors-three-concepts-to-gain-more-client-referrals",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In working with financial advisers every day, I appreciate the critical importance of new client introductions to a business from its existing clients. It&rsquo;s one of the most effective ways to grow a client base. Some advisers are extremely natural and comfortable using this marketing method and some unfortunately are not, which ultimately impacts the growth of their business.</p><p> I prefer to use the word &lsquo;introductions&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;referrals&rsquo;, as it has a much better connotation and leads to a better outcome. Whilst I acknowledge that this style of marketing is successful for the profession, it&rsquo;s not your client&rsquo;s job, at the end of the day, to market and promote your business. That responsibility lies solely with you. However, human nature being what it is means that when we experience a valuable service or purchase a product we like, we&rsquo;re likely to tell others.</p><p> With all that in mind, what makes a business successful at gaining new clients through their existing ones? Whilst I&rsquo;d like to say that if you take this magic pill you&rsquo;ll receive the magic number of new clients you&rsquo;d like, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that. Again, with human nature being what it is, what one person does may not appeal to another. Similarly, what one advice business does, may not resonate with another.</p><p> There is a common thread, though, that I have found while talking to, working with and learning from advice businesses across Australia. Successful advice businesses share the following principles. The question is, to what extent do you?</p><h3> <strong>  1. Ensure clients understand the full value of your advice </strong></h3><p> <br/> People talk most about your work when they really understand it. Unfortunately, not all clients, while they may have taken your advice, really understand its true value. Who is to blame? Is it the client, for not taking the time to understand? Is it you, for not adequately communicating its value? Or is it simply because the client has never had to make a claim and therefore can&rsquo;t really appreciate the value of your advice, yet?</p><p> New introductions come faster when clients recognise the extent to which you can improve their lives, and have already done so. They must be able to understand all your services and what it means to make a claim. They must also be able to explain to others what you do. I find the best way for an adviser to communicate, educate and position the value of their advice can be achieved in two ways.</p><p> The first is through the emotional experience &ndash; having the feeling they know that, should something happen to them or a loved one, they will be financially secure. The second is through sharing the many stories of when a client has made a claim and the fantastic result the adviser was able to deliver them. It doesn&rsquo;t always have to be a story about one of your clients. It can quite easily be a story about other clients &ndash; there are plenty of these great stories being shared around the industry. Share them and help clients to understand the value of your advice so that they can share those stories too. How many stories do you tell? How many of your clients are also sharing those stories?</p><h3> <strong>  2. Discuss the subject of business/professional growth with your clients </strong></h3><p> <br/> Growth is a natural part of life. It demonstrates that you are a positive, optimistic, and enthusiastic person. In fact, have you ever met someone who didn&rsquo;t appreciate a person who is positive and active about advancing themselves, whether personally or professionally? I know I haven&rsquo;t. We thrive by being around those who are positive and want to develop. The problem is that some people tend to become indifferent about advancing themselves, and for those that wish to, sometimes feel they shouldn&rsquo;t share that for fear of being adversely judged. Having surveyed hundreds of clients of financial advisers, I can share with you first hand that clients expect their adviser&rsquo;s businesses to grow and want to be part of a success story.</p><p> Have you noticed that when you have a growth mindset, other people seem to match your level of excitement? Yet many professionals consider it taboo to discuss their desire to grow their business by referral&mdash;especially with existing clients. The common reaction is, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t discuss or ask for referrals. It will make me look cheap or salesy.&rsquo; One important point I will make here is that asking for &lsquo;referrals&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t considered a modern day marketing method. It&rsquo;s more about positioning, encouraging and giving. That said, if you don&rsquo;t ask, you won&rsquo;t get!</p><p> Celebrate your business success. Let clients know that they are part of a business that is growing and that you would be honoured to help protect their family and friends just like you have for them. Have the confidence, the conviction and the commitment!</p><h3> <strong>  3. Say thank you </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;m known for saying that gifts are not required when a client introduces a family or friend to your business, because it can make the relationship awkward. What if you forget to give an introducing client a gift one time, which then may lead them to feel uncomfortable? Again, this is not a modern day marketing method. What do you do, then, to acknowledge that someone has been introduced to your business through an existing client and hope to get more of those introductions?</p><h3> Say thank you!</h3><p> <br/> It alarms me the number of times clients of financial advisers have told me that they have given their adviser a friend&rsquo;s name, but never heard what happened! Where have all the manners gone? When you ask a client what they want, they&rsquo;ll tell you. A simple thank you is all that is needed &ndash; a thank you card, email, or phone call. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult. If, throughout the year, the same client is responsible for growing your business because they have introduced all your new clients to you, then you may think about something special for them.</p><p> Every time a client introduces someone, gifts are not needed. But a thank you is.</p><h3> What now?</h3><p> <br/> Encourage everyone in your business to tell one story to every client at each meeting. I&rsquo;d even suggest stretching that to each strategic business partner, too. It will help them understand your value.</p><p> Get excited about the growth of your business and start weaving it into conversations with clients. And remember, when anyone introduces someone to your business, say thank you.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  Ben Cooper </u></p><p> We&rsquo;ve all been there before. You&rsquo;re perusing Twitter or Facebook and stumble across a headline that catches your eye. It looks interesting at first glance, maybe even shareable. But alas, after opening the link, you quickly realize this article is not quite what you thought it was&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  FOOLED! </strong></p><p> You&rsquo;ve just become a victim of a misleading headline. Some clickbait is easy to spot when it comes from a notorious offender, but other examples are much more difficult to recognize. We&rsquo;ve highlighted the most common types of misleading headlines found all across the news spectrum to help prevent you from being tricked.</p><h3> <strong>  Sponsored content </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Scientist reveals a major lie about heart health&rdquo; ─ &ldquo;6 credit cards with rewards you have to see to believe!&rdquo; ─ &ldquo;This quick fix will have your computer running 10x faster.&rdquo; Promoters have become increasingly savvy in how they disguise advertisements as news stories. These headlines are often embedded between articles on web platforms of credible outlets and can be extremely difficult to discern from original content. Be vigilant when browsing and make sure to recognize the information included in these paid-for posts is likely biased.</p><h3> <strong>  The clich&eacute;, excessively short headline </strong></h3><p> <br/> The ironic part about these headlines is that they are usually accompanied by excessively long articles. Regardless, they tell you very little about the actual facts and usually break typical headline rules like avoiding small words such as &ldquo;and,&rdquo; &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;the.&rdquo; Some examples include &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s biggest problem,&rdquo; &ldquo;The last man standing&rdquo; or &ldquo;A trip to remember.&rdquo; These headlines give you next to nothing in terms of information and bait readers into clicking to find out more.</p><h3> <strong>  SOURCES: Unattributed information offers unreliable perspective </strong></h3><p> <br/> We see it all the time in today&rsquo;s digital age. Journalists want to be the first to report new information and outlets have increasingly lax policies when it comes to citing anonymous sources. Without knowing where the information is coming from, how can we know if it&rsquo;s credible? Also, how do we know this &ldquo;person close to the situation&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have an ulterior motive? Investment bankers often leak potential M&amp;A or IPO news to reporters to drum up interest. But the tip could also be a last-ditch effort to save dying deal negotiations. The bottom line is we can never know for sure, and headlines citing anonymous sources could turn out to offer unreliable information.</p><h3> <strong>  The leading question </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;What went wrong with the economy?&rdquo; ─ &ldquo;Is this the end of the world as we know it?&rdquo; ─ &ldquo;What is the biggest threat to your health?&rdquo; Some headlines often pose a question to draw in readers. Usually they are questions people are generally interested in having answered. However, more often than not, readers are sadly disappointed after realizing three paragraphs in that the article has no intention of actually responding to the original inquiry, leaving the reader irritated and bereft of any concrete explanation or new information. This can be especially frustrating and chalked up as a big waste of time. Questions as headlines can offer value in certain instances, but they must be done right.</p><p> Given the explosion of free online content, outlets are forced to distinguish their news stories to drive web traffic. From this perspective, the clickbait phenomenon makes sense, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why catchy and perhaps misleading headlines are so much in vogue. It is the easiest way to survive in the extremely competitive modern media environment. However, that doesn&rsquo;t excuse readers from being lazy. Plenty of strong, well-reported news stories exist; they&rsquo;re just a little harder to find. Stay vigilant when reading and keep a critical eye to avoid being fooled.</p>",

    "title": "How to Create a Culture of Action",
    "link": "how-to-create-a-culture-of-action",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Over a decade of creating and leading insight teams has taught me that two aspects of team culture are critical for customer insight teams to make a real difference to the wider business. One is collaboration between the different technical discipline (to deliver  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/breadth-customer-insight/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   holistic customer insights  </a> </u> ), the other is action-orientation, galvanising the team behind a vision of driving change in the real world. This goes beyond delivery of technical analysis or Powerpoint, to focus on the decision &amp; action needed to deliver commercial results and improved experiences as judged by your customers.</p><p> As with most cultural challenges, it takes time, determination and consistency in leadership. Mostly through getting it wrong first, which seems to be how I&rsquo;ve learnt most of my leadership lessons, I have discovered a few tips which help embed this action-orientated culture. None is a panacea and each need to be practiced consistently and equitably, so they become assumed and just embedded in the &ldquo;the way we do things round here&rdquo;. Anyway, enough soap-boxing from me, here are those tips from the trenches:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Filter out requests that won&rsquo;t drive action:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> As with most systems, garbage in = garbage out, so the most sensible place to start with culture change is the start of new work processes. Here it&rsquo;s important to train and support your analysts in challenging new requests for work and importantly using incisive questioning to drill down to the real need. By focussing on what the business/internal-stakeholder really needs, not just what they want, it should be possible to uncover the real motivation for the proposed work. An analyst should make clear that the reason for this questioning is two-fold: (a) to better understand the real need so as to identify the most appropriate solution (across a number of potential technical approaches) or identify that existing work could meet that need; (b) to check what action will be taken as a result of answering that question. The latter is what is critical to this culture change. If such questioning/challenge reveals that it&rsquo;s really just of academic interest to another leader and there is no commitment to take action on the results, then you should back your analyst in declining. Customer Insight work only adds value if it is acted upon and you cannot afford for costly technical resource to be tied up satisfying someone else&rsquo;s intellectual curiosity or desire to appear smart.</p><h3> <strong>  2. All output must include recommendations:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once the brief has been completed and technical work completed, the important work of writing up the results and  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/analysts-storytellers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   telling a compelling story to engage the business  </a> </u>  begins. Another expectation which any customer insight leader should make clear to their team is that this output (often in PowerPoint) must include clear recommendations for action. Wherever possible this should include timely decisions or actions that the business can be taking promptly, even if they are only interim steps before a final solution. But even if the insight work has simply identified the need for more data or further work to answer the question, that must be drawn out as a clear recommendation, alongside any investment or change needed in the wider business to avoid being is this situation again. Consistently requiring clear recommendations which force the business to take decisions on action, including sending work back to analysts as unacceptable without these, will drive change.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Refocus your progress updates on action taken:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Regular profess update meetings or calls are a feature of most insight teams. Depending on your organisational culture and personal management style, you may do these weekly, fortnightly or monthly and may favour &ldquo;morning prayers&rdquo;, mid-day meeting or end of the day &ldquo;wrap ups&rdquo;. However, you do it, as a leader what you choose to focus on in these meetings often conveys more in terms of culture than your words. Requiring updates to be structured in terms of the action they are aimed to drive (i.e. improvement in commercial metric or improvement in customer experience scores) and protecting time to check-in on progress with the required business decisions and actions needed to achieve these, will speak volumes to your managers and team. It is key to make clear that in assessing everyone&rsquo;s performance, you want the acid test to be war change they have driven in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, not just efficient process following or delivery of great looking slides. This does raise the bar and require your team to influence stakeholders in other teams, attend key meetings and even &ldquo;walk the floor&rdquo; &ndash; but getting out there is great for showing to the wider business and your team that you care about the difference being made.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Communicate to top-table with final outcomes:  </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve shared previously some  <u>  <a href=\"http://customerinsightleader.com/opinion/can-influence-top-table/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   tips for influencing once in the boardroom or exec committee  </a> </u> . A key part of engaging these directors is communicating in terms of what matters to them. Here, leveraging the regular updates you receive in terms of action being taken and communicating them in terms of the outcomes being driven (improved incremental income/profit or improved NPS et al) can make a huge difference to how customer insight is perceived. I have seen many a director over the years turn from scepticism to passionate support once they experience that their customer insight leader doesn&rsquo;t just want to bore them with technical jargon but rather is actively engaged with how insight is improving the key commercial numbers and ensuring better customer experience. Coupled with visible cooperation with Marketing and Operations, to ensure the insight &ldquo;baton&rdquo; is safely passed to those teams owning taking action and that you continue to run with them to ensure it works in practice, can build positive impressions which deliver support in the boardroom .</p><p> I hope those tips help. None is rocket science and I&rsquo;m sure only serve as a reminder of best practice you know already, but hopefully that&rsquo;s a good thing too.</p><p> As a final comment, just let me say that this also has benefits for your customer insight team members. Almost every analyst/researcher that I&rsquo;ve employed over the years wants to make a difference. They want all those hours in the office to count for something &ndash; to result in an improvement they are proud off. So, although it can seem like more work for them to start with, I have seen delivering the above culture also be welcomed by a team who start to sit up straighter and believe in themselves more. The sense of pride they experience in being a key part of your business and not just being good at what they do but delivering insights that really matter, is a huge benefit. In these days of so many businesses struggling to recruit and retain analytical talent, it can also bea real source of competitive advantage.</p><p> In fact working on your customer insight team culture could be a far better investment than the latest shiny software or more external data. It might just be your only sustainable competitive advantage in the coming &ldquo;talent wars&rdquo;.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> How much fun it is to dream about what you would do if there were no limitations to consider. <br/>  </h3><p> Every day, I talk with financial advisors who finish the sentence &ldquo;in a perfect world&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;go independent&rdquo; because they yearn for greater freedom, flexibility and control, and want to eliminate bureaucracy from their life&rsquo;s work.</p><p> These are the folks that have entrepreneurial DNA, love the idea of creating a legacy and building a sustainable enterprise. And so, they begin to explore what going independent really means by looking at different models and getting educated about what it takes to be a successful business owner.</p><p> We seem to be reading more and more about yet another corner office team leaving the employee-model behind and either launching their own RIA or joining a quasi-independent firm like HighTower. To be sure, after much due diligence, a growing percentage of former employee advisors are choosing to break away from W-2 status because they realize that everything about independence is appealing to them: The freedom they will have, the superior long term economics, the ability to create a customized model that will allow them to service their clients in a more bespoke fashion, and the ability to act as a true fiduciary.</p><p> But, there are also a good percentage of advisors currently practicing in the broker dealer world who are intrigued by the notion of independence, yet in the end, realize that they just aren&rsquo;t as entrepreneurial as they might have imagined.</p><p> <strong>  This is usually true for one of two reasons: </strong></p><li> The desire to monetize their business in the short-term is greater than the value they place on the long-term economics of business ownership. Said another way: they aren&rsquo;t willing to take the leap of faith that going independent requires, being willing to give up big up-front money in return for building equity.</li><li> What it takes to be a good advisor doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equate to being a good business owner, so once they realize what&rsquo;s involved in managing an independent practice, they decide they are better suited for life as an employee.</li><p> So what do these advisors wind up doing&mdash;the ones who are sure that their current firm is no longer the right one? What do they do if they crave more freedom and flexibility than they have now?</p><p> <strong>  One of four things happens: </strong></p><li> They move to another major firm for the next nine years (the length of the forgivable loan attached to a transition package) and figure they are young enough to go independent later on. (This allows an advisor to monetize now for maximum short-term gain and then move later to satisfy their as yet unfulfilled entrepreneurial spirit.)</li><li> They decide to ditch the notion of independence altogether, realizing that the name brand and turnkey support of a big firm is essential to them.</li><li> They choose to stay put, making peace with what&rsquo;s been frustrating them and deciding that, in fact, the grass wasn&rsquo;t any greener elsewhere.</li><li> They choose to move to another firm (wirehouse, regional or boutique). They know that there is leverage in being recruited and they will be paid an outsized transition package and be given things like a greater expense budget and more support. And they will work with the firm to craft a value proposition that can be shared with clients to let them know that the move is being made in order to better serve them.</li><p> Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a &ldquo;perfect world&rdquo;&mdash;yet that doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t consider and pursue options that might be &ldquo;perfect enough&rdquo;. </p><p> Regardless of whether an advisor goes independent or chooses to remain an employee, personal economics always need to be considered, along with one&rsquo;s own motivation for change and risk tolerance. And only then can one define &ndash; and live in &ndash; their own version of a perfect world.</p>",

    "title": "Are Challenger Banks Better than The \"Big Four\"?",
    "link": "are-challenger-banks-better-than-the-big-four",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Challenger banks have been a black cloud looming over the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; for the past few years. <br/>  </h3><p> The traditional high street banks have been braced for these challengers to shake things up and create an entirely new environment, just as budget airlines did to the aviation industry in the nineties. And with the FCA keen to see consumers benefit from &ldquo;effective competition&rdquo; for regulated financial services, the time seems right.</p><p> However, while those working in the industry are tracking every move of the challengers and what they offer, this awareness has yet to filter down to customers. With the big four still holding over 90 percent of the UK market, and consumer awareness of challenger brands failing to gain momentum, is the impending shake-up going to happen, and if so, when?</p><p> The big four are portrayed as clunky behemoths held back from innovating by complicated legacy infrastructure that is creaking at the seams. In just the first few months of 2016, customers of some of the major banks have experienced cashpoint outages, data breaches and system failures. What is interesting, and at odds with consumer behaviour in other industries, is that customers are not reacting by switching brands in their droves to new suppliers &ndash; despite the seven-day switch service introduced by the Government in 2013, which makes switching current accounts easier than ever. So why the complacency?</p><h3> 1. The path of least resistance? <br/>  </h3><p> New challengers are offering faster, cheaper transactions with greater flexibility than ever &ndash; yet customers are still hesitant to switch. Banking is seen by customers as a chore, and many customers lack confidence in financial planning matters. Consequently, spending time researching and understanding different banking products, switching to a new bank or account, and then getting used to a different way of doing things, is something that many customers avoid. This is why UK customers are collectively losing out on &pound;3 billion through money sat in low-interest savings accounts. And it&rsquo;s why the challengers may well continue to struggle to gain traction against the tried-and-tested big banks. </p><h3> 2. Step forward the challengers <br/>  </h3><p> The challengers to traditional retail banking take several forms. First off, supermarket retailers such as Tesco, M&amp;S and Sainsbury&rsquo;s were quick to head into the banking space with uncomplicated current and savings accounts. It made sense; these are heavily data-rich organisations, putting them in prime position to offer customer-centric services. They have the on-street presence through stores across the UK, and can interact directly with their customers without huge start-up costs.</p><p> The next wave of challengers concentrated on putting the customer at the centre of their communications. Virgin crashed into the market in 1995 with Virgin Money, branding their high street outlets as stores, rather than branches, with a new focus on customers&rsquo; individual needs. Metro Bank arrived in 2010, introducing a softer side to the retail banking market with their mission to create &ldquo;fans not customers&rdquo;. Growth for these new players has not proven easy, however &ndash; Virgin Money only has 75 stores nationally, compared to Lloyds&rsquo; network of nearly 1,300 branches &ndash; and there has also been a string of banking start-ups that have failed during the same period, the most well-known of which is Prudential Banking&rsquo;s internet bank, Egg, established in 1998. The costs of creating a high street presence to rival that of the big four make the direct high street challenge almost impossible, and without a high street presence to back them up, online banks have historically struggled to gain traction and retain customers for the long term.</p><h3> 3. Don&rsquo;t talk, tap <br/>  </h3><p> A new breed of mobile-only and mobile-first banks is hoping to reverse those trends and succeed where others have struggled. And in an age where laptops are being replaced by mobile devices, where people trust new brands like never before (think Uber, Netflix and Airbnb), and where we are moving to mobile for more and more of our daily tasks and activities, these new banks may just have their timing right.</p><p> Atom bank intends to build relationships with customers by never being more than one atom away from them, using mobile technology to enable seamless integration into everyday life. Atom, along with Starling, Fidor and Open bank, all recognise that the new age of customers demand to use services on the go. These customers live on their mobile phones and expect to be able to complete all of their transactions that way. These new players hope that customers will value the fast and convenient features and services, from biometric authentication to digital wallets, above a traditional high street presence.</p><p> This low cost-base proposition allows the mobile banks to lead with low-interest loans and high-interest savings. And the new breed is also tapping into cultural trends, such as social networking and online communities, to appeal further to today&rsquo;s customers and to help them self-serve. Fidor even links its number of social followers to its interest rates, and is using a community-centric model to help enable it to serve its 300,000 customers with just 32 employees.</p><h3> 4. Unify to achieve scale <br/>  </h3><p> Whether the challengers succeed or not, customers will benefit from this period of market disruption, as it is forcing traditional banks to reassess their services and ensure they remain competitive. My view on the future of retail banking is ultimately one of unity. I expect there will be further challenges to the incumbent banks, but there will be two long term survival strategies: stick to a niche market, serve that market well and own the space; or work together with the traditional banks to gain scale. The incumbents will need to innovate faster and faster, but tied down by legacy systems and processes, they cannot do it alone. The challengers offer technological innovation and slick customer experience in spades, but may struggle to gain traction against customer inertia and to navigate the regulatory banking landscape. Joining forces would be mutually beneficial to both the incumbent and the start-up &ndash; and ultimately the customer.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I was on a treadmill for my annual physical and the attending physician suddenly shouted for me to stop&mdash;immediately. <br/>  </h3><p> He said the test was showing I had ischemia, a condition wherein the heart does not get enough oxygen and stops beating, resulting in instant death.</p><p> The FBI sent me to a heart specialist and prohibited me from participating in firearms or any activity that involved physical exertion. The ischemia scare was a life-changing event for me; it&rsquo;s the primary reason healthy athletes drop dead.</p><p> I suffered a long period of high-magnitude stress. In the months that followed, it was determined that my heart gulps for oxygen, corrects itself, and recovers quickly. While my physical condition was eventually diagnosed as excellent, I had suffered my first health crisis.</p><p> A challenge is amplified when we don&rsquo;t see it coming, when we don&rsquo;t have any control over it, and when it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve never had to deal with before.</p><p> I had to find a way to get through this challenge, so I turned to <u>  <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2011/04/building-resilience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   research conducted by the U.S. Army on Post Trauma Stress Disorder (PTSD)  </a> </u> . We all deal with stress, trauma, and crises in different ways.</p><p> When faced with a traumatic event, most people react with symptoms of depression and anxiety, but within a month or so are physically and psychologically back to where they were before the trauma. They accept responsibility for their actions, forget about blaming others, and move. That is resilience.</p><p> The study found that some have a tougher time and may need counseling and medication to get through. There are a few individuals, however, who actually have  <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  post-traumatic growth </a> . They, too, first experience depression and anxiety, but within a year they are actually better off than they were before the trauma, crisis, or challenge.</p><p> These were the people I needed to learn from, and so do you if you&rsquo;re in leadership, a business owner, or an entrepreneur because you&rsquo;ve also faced your share of challenges. If you have mental toughness, you will learn from your experiences so you are stronger than when you started. </p><p> Mental toughness is managing our emotions, thoughts, and behavior in ways that set us up for success.</p><p> Here are 3 tips on how you can use mental toughness to help get you through any challenge:</p><h3> 1. THINK ABOUT YOUR CHALLENGE DIFFERENTLY <br/>  </h3><p> Soldiers who experienced a crisis or trauma were able to reframe the trauma in such a way that they could extract meaning from it.</p><p> Although they are able to reinterpret their situation, it is not blind optimism or disingenuous positive thinking that creates the change. The suffering is real; the difference is that they use positivity as a mental framework for turning their suffering into achievement and self-improvement.</p><p> ACTION: Post-traumatic growth does not mean you will be free of the memories or grief. If you try to put your life back together and pretend that nothing has happened, you&rsquo;ll remain fractured and vulnerable. But if you accept the breakage, you can cultivate growth within yourself, become more resilient, and open to new ways of living.</p><h3> 2. USE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE WHEN TALKING ABOUT YOUR CHALLENGE <br/>  </h3><p> Mental toughness in the face of crisis and trauma is not simply about coping; it is intentionally choosing to change the way your see yourself and the challenge you are experiencing. It is not choosing to be a victim.</p><p> It is estimated that we say between 300 to 1,000 words to ourselves per minute. If we speak positively to ourselves, we can over ride fear, worry, and anxiety when faced with adversity or trauma. Emotions are processed by the limbic brain system.</p><p> Brain imaging has shown that negative emotions interfere with the brain&rsquo;s ability to solve problems and other cognitive functions.</p><p> ACTION: Since the brain responds so powerfully to negative emotions, you must intentionally choose positive thoughts to interrupt the brain&rsquo;s tendency toward negativity.</p><h3> 3. SHARE YOUR CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS <br/>  </h3><p> People who experience post traumatic growth are able to do so only when they deepen their relationships with others. Their depth and appreciation for those relationships is extraordinary.</p><p> Soldier Fitness programs have identified these key areas as essential for resilience and post traumatic growth:</p><li> Re-connecting with families, relatives, friends, co-workers, and neighbors. Positive growth from trauma is nurtured by supportive relationships.</li><li> Volunteering, in whatever capacity, to ease the pain and suffering of the general population. The benefit we receive when helping others is as great as the feelings of wellbeing from those we help.</li><li> Asking help from other people when everything seems insurmountable. This is the time to let go of individualistic attitude in favor of collective efforts.</li><li> Turning to one&rsquo;s faith as a source of solace and comfort. Numerous studies have discovered that religious and spiritual activities can moderate depression and stress.</li><p> ACTION: You are stronger than you think you are. Remember to focus on how to change your emotions, thoughts, and behavior when a challenge or adversity comes your way.</p><p> Consider the words of Warren Buffett in a recent Wall Street Journal article: &ldquo;The truth is, everything that has happened in my life&hellip; that I thought was a crushing event at the time, has turned out for the better.\"</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Operating a small business is no small feat. <br/>  </h3><p> You need to establish a name for yourself by generating leads, meet a myriad of goals, connect with bazillions of potential prospects, and a seemingly endless list of more to-do&rsquo;s; all while trying to compete with larger-than-life corporate entities. Starting a business among already established corporate giants can feel a lot like the story of David and Goliath, yet you are unsure if it will end in the same way.</p><p> In order for the small-timers to fill David&rsquo;s shoes and conquer those unconquerable foes, one must apply every tool, service, solution, tip, and trick that makes tangible sense for their business. And thanks to the wonderful age we live in, there is a bounty of options available to increase the odds of success. The problem is finding the best of the best.</p><p> Mobile devices have made it possible to run a business while on the go; a supreme luxury in today&rsquo;s insanely fast-paced society. It is for that reason that we are going to check out 5 powerful business applications to help you conquer your Goliath and build your business into a top competitor.</p><h3> #1: Workflow <br/>  </h3><p> This personal automation tool helps keep mundane and frivolous tasks at a minimum by acting on your behalf for the less than desirable duties at hand.  <u>  <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Workflow  </a>  &rsquo;s </u> drag-and-drop interface makes creating various plans of action incredibly simple. The iOS compatible app can call an Uber for you to ensure you aren&rsquo;t late for your next meeting, create PDF&rsquo;s to be shared with clients, post images to Twitter to keep audiences engaged, and loads more essential tasks. Simply set the criteria for a certain action to take place, and once that condition has been met, Workflow will do the rest. Best of all is that Workflow integrates with various apps like Dropbox, Evernote, and Facebook, with over 200 actions that you can eliminate from your daily routine.</p><h3> #2: Expensify <br/>  </h3><p> Starting a small business likely has you jetting from coast to coast trying to land deals. In that time, you are sure to rack of plenty of expenses that need to be tracked; that&rsquo;s where  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.expensify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Expensify  </a> </u>  comes in.</p><p> Expensify provides &ldquo;expense reports that don&rsquo;t suck&rdquo; by allowing users to scan and organize receipts simply and easily. The app&rsquo;s &ldquo;smart&rdquo; mode even fills in various fields like purchase amounts automatically. But it doesn&rsquo;t just track receipts as users can record time, mileage, and other things as well. At the end of the trip, you will have a detailed expense report ready to go.</p><h3> #3: Nintype <br/>  </h3><p> Emails are the foundation of corporate communications, which means that there are loads to shift through and respond to each and every day. When responding on a mobile device, keyboard size is sure to slow down the process.  <u>  <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nintype/id796959534?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Nintype  </a> </u>  eliminates that sluggishness forever.</p><p> This app leverages various combinations of double taps and swipes to help users to type over 100 words per minute. Backspace slides, edge slide shortcuts, and a correction bar at the top makes sending emails from smaller screens a synch. If you prefer normal typing, however, Nintype accommodates that as well.</p><h3> #4: Periscope <br/>  </h3><p> Live-streaming video is hotter than ever as everyone from Facebook to Google hoping in on the action.  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.periscope.tv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Periscope  </a> </u> , however, is still one of the most powerful and popular applications for this type of video solution.</p><p> Periscope is an incredible tool for helping businesses gain awareness and notoriety through broadcasting live Q&amp;A sessions, how-to tutorials, special offers, and more. Live streaming presents the gift of getting up close and personal with viewers to build authentic, meaningful relationships with audiences. An invaluable opportunity for those who are just starting out.</p><h3> #5: Evernote Scannable <br/>  </h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/id883338188\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Evernote Scannable  </a> </u>  is the best thing since  a smartphone when it comes to managing contacts and documents from a mobile device. Users can scan and digitally store everything from receipts to contracts, business cards, and pretty every other type of document you could possibly need. Plus, Evernote Scannable has tons of other useful features like pulling LinkedIn information for business cards that are scanned, sending documents via text and email, file exporting and conversion tools, and so much more.</p><p> Running a business is a really challenging undertaking; growing it is even harder. Let technology do the heavy lifting so you can enjoy the fruits of your labors. Go get &lsquo;em.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> If you&rsquo;re like us at Startup Connection, you have big ambitions. You don&rsquo;t see the world as it is; you see it as it could be. <br/>  </h3><p> We pride ourselves on this style of thinking, and we admire anyone who shares this kind of vision.</p><p> Sometimes, it gets hard to keep reaching for the stars, so that&rsquo;s why we put together Five Big Ideas Every Entrepreneur Needs to Hear in today&rsquo;s post to give you the inspiration you need to keep pushing forward with your business on the pathway to success.</p><h3> 1.  &ldquo;What would you do if you weren&rsquo;t afraid?&rdquo; &ndash; Sheryl Sandberg <br/>  </h3><p> We love this kind of thinking because it&rsquo;s so incredibly vital to remove fear as the chief motivator of our decision-making.</p><p> Yes, you should weigh risk when making decisions, but fear is different than risk. Risk says, &ldquo;Hey, if you do this, you have a 40 percent chance of losing $20,000 per month.&rdquo; Risk then leaves it up to you to decide.</p><p> Fear says, &ldquo;Oh no, you can&rsquo;t do this! You might lose $20,000 per month and embarrass yourself and not be able to pay for your kids&rsquo; college!&rdquo; Fear doesn&rsquo;t leave you the room to decide. It tries to bully you into doing what it wants.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re able to do what you want and conquer fear, you&rsquo;ll be amazed and what you can accomplish, and how much more fulfilled you are, along the way.</p><p> <img alt=\"big idea 3\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.startupconnection.net/wp-content/uploads/big-idea-3.jpg?resize=300%2C188\"/></p><h3> 2.  &ldquo;The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.&rdquo; &ndash; \"Think Different&rdquo; campaign for Apple by Chiat Day <br/>  </h3><p> Apple has had some of the best ads of all-time because they focus on the values of the company, instead of the offerings. In their &ldquo;Think Different&rdquo; campaign, they asserted that big ideas can change the world. It&rsquo;s true.</p><p> When you have big, bold ideas, some people are going to find that a little crazy. That&rsquo;s okay. Maybe it takes a little crazy to change the world.</p><p> <img alt=\"big idea 2\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.startupconnection.net/wp-content/uploads/big-idea-2.jpg?resize=300%2C158\"/></p><h3> 3.  &ldquo;A vision without execution is hallucination.&rdquo; &ndash; Thomas Edison <br/>  </h3><p> We preach this very principle here at Startup Connection all the time. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times we&rsquo;ve seen a truly good idea struggle to get off the ground because the person or team behind it wasn&rsquo;t adept at implementing it.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, ideas matter. Ideas are where it all gets started. Without great ideas, you will always have a tough time. But, once you have that idea, you need to build the infrastructure and processes to put it into action &ndash; otherwise the idea has no value. As an entrepreneur with tons of ideas, it can be easy to forget that, so always take time to remind yourself of this truth.</p><h3> 4.   You will make mistakes. Treat them as learning experiences. <br/>  </h3><p> Have you ever made a mistake? If you answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; then you have a much bigger problem than the person who answered &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ve never made a mistake, then that means you&rsquo;ve lived your life by making the safest possible decisions and never ventured outside of your comfort zone and never learned a whole lot.</p><p> Society often perceives mistakes as failures. That&rsquo;s usually not true. If you make a mistake, you usually learn something for next time, and that makes you smarter and more experienced. The only time you fail by making a mistake is when you don&rsquo;t learn anything and keep making that same mistake.</p><h3> 5.  Why are you different, how do you communicate your difference, and does anyone care about it? <br/>  </h3><p> Herein lies the key to marketing. Anytime you&rsquo;re developing a new product, make sure to address these three questions. If your product is like everyone else&rsquo;s, then there really isn&rsquo;t a need for it. If it is different but you can&rsquo;t communicate that difference clearly or without spending millions upon millions to educate the consumer, that&rsquo;s a red flag. And, if your difference is something insignificant or irrelevant to your consumer, then your difference doesn&rsquo;t have any value.</p><p> Seek to stand out, but do it in a way that means something to your consumers, and make sure it&rsquo;s a difference that you can clearly and easily explain.</p><p> These are things we believe here at Startup Connection. Being an entrepreneur is hard work, and to get where you want to go, you need to think big, believe in yourself, and make sure you have developed sound mechanics to actually get there.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Thinking about going inbound, creating content, getting more leads? </p><p> Check out these marketing mistakes that RIAs, financial advisors, and investment managers can smartly bypass on the road to raising revenue:</p><h3> 1. Not Going Inbound <br/>  </h3><p> Inbound marketing is different than traditional outbound marketing: it seeks to inform, educate, and answer questions when consumers are ready to learn &ndash; not, as much traditional advertising does, which is to interrupt. Inbound marketing has changed the way fund marketers can reach potential buyers. It&rsquo;s all about attracting the right people, educating them with the right content, and converting them into leads at the right time.</p><h3> 2. Creating Content Without a Strategy <br/>  </h3><p> Before you create content, you need to figure out what content you need to create that will drive people to your website who might want to buy your stuff. You'll need to map your content to your target audience, create a list of keywords&hellip;and then develop the content. So: strategy first, then tactics.</p><h3> 3. Not Committing to a Creating Compelling Content <br/>  </h3><p> A successful inbound marketing strategy takes diligence and patience in the creation and distribution. It's important that clear goals are defined on the outset. But the content also needs to be driven by the tone and format that will engage and resonate with your potential investors. How long did it take to build Rome? Or any successful venture? Probably not overnight.</p><h3> 4. Not Focusing on Finishing a Few Things Fantastically <br/>  </h3><p> To successfully invest in inbound marketing, you need to build your marketing components gradually over many months, and take each step one at a time. The key is to prioritize.</p><p> Do one or two things well, then do more. For example, you may first want to build our your blog to 50 or 100 posts, then repurpose the two best post into excellent eBooks. Or you may want to focus on creating your social media program first. Even with social media, it may be best to focus on one platform first, say Twitter, and become a master Twitterer before developing your Google+ program. Other content, such as infographics, webinars, and email marketing can be saved for the next phase of content development.</p><h3> 5.  Not Setting Goals SMART Goals <br/>  </h3><p> What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; goal? It&rsquo;s a goal that is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. Peter Drucker, in his book &ldquo;The Practice of Management,&rdquo; coined the phrase in 1954&hellip;it still obtains.</p><p> Specific. Every goal should have a number, like \"write two blog articles a week\" - not \"write more blogs.\"</p><p> Measurable. If you want to know if you are reaching your goals, you&rsquo;ll need a yardstick of real numbers.</p><p> Attainable. Fancy hard goals may look good on paper, but if they are not realist or otherwise not attainable, why commit to them? Be honest and true about capabilities.</p><p> Relevant. Your goals should actually matter to your business. Let's say you're a unicorn food company that has 100 stores that will only accept 10 boxes of unicorn food in their store. In this situation, your goal likely shouldn't be to \"increase production of unicorn food from 1,000 per month to 5,000 per month.\" While it's great you have more product, if no one is going to buy them, why bother?</p><p> Timely. Stick to your deadlines! If you keep pushing it back, your goals lose credibility and the system falls apart.</p><h3> 6. Not Using Content You've Already Got <br/>  </h3><p> You don't necessarily have to reengineer your website and marketing materials. Better to simply optimize the material you already have.</p><p> If your website is already wonderful, you may just want to add targeted calls to actions and landing page links. If you have a series of brochure guides, you can repurpose it into an eBook, pitch book, blog post, or webinar.</p><h3> 7. Not Having a Blog <br/>  </h3><p> Don't have time to start or maintain a blog? Analyze this: a financial blog that educates investors and potential clients about what you can help make you a thought leader. A blog can help show that your firm is knowledgeable about what concerns your clients. And the more posts you have the more authority &ndash; and indexed pages - you potentially possess.</p><p> Potential clients, if they are not referred to you, will start their research online. Which RIA or financial advisory firm do you think they will choose to contact?</p><p> As an advisor for client portfolios, you may often counsel clients how to best invest to meet long-term goals. If one of your long-term goals is to create more assets under management, you may want to consider building your firm&rsquo;s blog.</p><h3> 8. Relying Too Much on Google Search for Potential Clients to Find You <br/>  </h3><p> Compelling content does not create overnight traffic, leads, phone calls, appointments, or new clients. From the time a potential clients first sees you online to wiring that first deposit may take three months, six months, a year, or more. So what do you do in the meantime? Just wait? Should you continue to rely on traditional lead sourcing like referrals, events, seminars, and just being super special?</p><p> Well, no, of course waiting is not the answer. But social media and pay per click advertising may provide a quick boost of visibility, recognition, and revenue, both in the short term and the long term.</p><h3> 9. Having an Outdated Email List <br/>  </h3><p> How old is your email list? Unless you've scrubbed it in the past three months or so, well, probably not. Expect attrition and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. Subscribers will unsubscribe over time, or opt out, or move from one job to another without letting you know, or will simply forget why they were on list in the first place. You&rsquo;ll always need to refresh the list with fresh fruit.</p><h3> 10. Talking About Yourself Too Much <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s not about you. It&rsquo;s about what you can do for your clients. Your marketing should be focused on helping prospects find answers to their fresh needs, questions and concerns. By adding value for your prospective investors, you potentially add long-term revenue to your practice.</p><h3> 11. Asking for the Sale Way Too Early <br/>  </h3><p> Not all investors are ready to sign up for one on his or her first visit to your website. But you probably knew that. Some content is better for folks who are in the awareness stage (the know they have a problem, but haven&rsquo;t quite figured out how to approach solving it). If your typical sales cycle is six months from first content to dotted line with your current marketing methods, the same time might be required for leads brought to you via inbound.</p><h3> 12. Not Analyzing Enough <br/>  </h3><p> Track the metrics! But only those that count. How much additional website traffic are you looking to get each month from Twitter, LinkedIn, other social media sites; from pay per click advertising; and from organic search?  Are you looking to track specific blog post traffic? Do you know what&rsquo;s working? Some blog post draw better than others; some tweets are awesome, some fall flat; some eBooks produce phone calls, others not.</p>",

Visualizing that new Apple Watch on your wrist or that Caribbean vacation is a no-brainer, but it&rsquo;s a lot tougher to think decades into the future.</p><p> The internal war between want and should is a constant battle. You can intellectually reason the whys of saving for retirement or college or not overspending your cash flow. But the electric connection in your brain&mdash;the one that rationalizes all the reasons why tomorrow will take care of itself&mdash;overtakes rational thought.</p><p> And therein lies the problem.</p><p> That all-or-nothing mentality is a recipe for dissatisfaction. If you live only for today, the financial ramification in the future is disaster.</p><h3> If you live only for the future, your happiness today suffers. The right answer? Try a little balance.  <br/>  </h3><li> Begin with a list of your unmovable MUSTS. What is non-negotiable when it comes to your financial goals? It might be education, retirement, living debt-free or something else that touches the core of your beliefs.</li><li> Understand what those goals mean in terms of time, available dollars and the amount of risk you are willing to take. Without quantifying the end number, you&rsquo;re pretty much in the dark (and don&rsquo;t forget to take the affects of inflation into account).</li><li> Know that there are various types of risk. In terms of your life goals, there&rsquo;s the risk of something not happening and the risk associated with the growth of your assets to meet your objective. You need to address both.</li><li> Know your cash flow&mdash;what comes in and what goes out. If you don&rsquo;t know your numbers, you&rsquo;re pretty much finished before you start.</li><li> Create a list of &ldquo;now&rdquo; or short-term goals that would increase your life satisfaction, along with their financial cost.</li><li> Recognize that without creating more income to cover your wants and needs, your only option is to reduce your expenses. Consider whether you can shift your spending without feeling miserable.</li><li> Nothing happens to increase your happiness unless you take action. Getting stuck on all the variables does you no good. Start now and refine as you move forward. For example, if saving for retirement is vital&mdash;make sure you are contributing to a retirement plan. It might not be the &ldquo;right&rdquo; number, but it&rsquo;s a start until you get a better handle on what it&rsquo;s going to take.</li><li> Get help if you need it. If you lack the financial knowledge, get help. Work with a qualified fee-only planner who can help you define and refine your thinking in terms of your life and your money.</li><p> Or&mdash;on the other hand&mdash;you could do nothing.</p>",

    "link": "the-top-reasons-why-actively-managed-funds-underperform",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Trying to pick individual stocks is a losing game, and this doesn&rsquo;t just apply to individual investors. It&rsquo;s also true for professionally run, actively managed mutual funds. <br/>  </h3><p> Actively managed funds are tasked with picking a collection of stocks and bonds that will outperform market indices, or benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow. They&rsquo;re armed with Ph.D. analysts, hundreds of interns, and tools and research to which very few of us have access &mdash; but they can&rsquo;t consistently beat their benchmarks by enough to justify their costs.</p><h3> Long-term underperformance</h3><p> <br/> Eighty-six percent of actively managed funds failed to beat their benchmarks in 2014, according to the <u>  <a href=\"http://www.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices scorecard  </a> </u> . &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; you may say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only one year.&rdquo; But 89% of funds failed to beat their benchmarks during the past five years; 82% failed to do so during the last decade.</p><p> The following data helps illustrate how unlikely it is for active managers to beat the market over longer periods. During a one-year period, a high percentage of active managers in some categories may outperform their benchmarks. But over five- and 10-year periods, fewer active managers outperform.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Percentage_of_Actively_Manged_Funds_That_Outperform_Benchmarks_001.png\" width=\"929\"/></p><p>  </p><p> Some managers do outperform the market, but picking a winning manager is as tricky as picking winning stocks. If you still think you can find &ldquo;a good manager&rdquo; who is the exception, consider this widely accepted Wall Street rule of thumb: Past performance doesn&rsquo;t guarantee future performance. A manager who outperformed last year may not do it again this year.</p><h3> Reasons for underperformance <br/>  </h3><p> There are a few main reasons actively managed funds underperform, aside from picking the wrong investments:</p><h3> <strong>  FEES </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Many actively managed funds charge 1% to 2% per year in management fees, while a passively managed exchange-traded fund could charge as little as 0.1% to 0.2% per year. And many actively managed mutual funds are loaded funds, which means you&rsquo;ll pay a sales charge, typically between 4% to 8% of your investment, when you buy or sell the fund &mdash; though the fee may decrease the longer you stay invested. Compounded over time, these higher fees can eat up a lot of gain, reducing overall returns.</p><h3> <strong>  TAXES </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Because actively managed funds try to time the market and pick winners, they buy and sell positions frequently. These transaction costs reduce the fund&rsquo;s returns, and all the buying and selling can also create taxable gain. Fund managers have no incentive to avoid this because they simply pass those taxable gains on to you, the shareholder.</p><h3> <strong>  MARKET EFFICIENCY </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Some argue that markets are becoming more efficient, making it difficult to identify overvalued or undervalued stocks. The efficient market hypothesis states that stocks are constantly adjusting to news and information, and thus their share prices reflect their &ldquo;fair value.&rdquo; In simpler language, other than in the very short term, there are no undervalued stocks to buy or inflated stocks to sell. This makes it virtually impossible to outperform the market through individual stock selection and market timing.</p><h3> An unsustainable approach <br/>  </h3><p> Whether active management can outperform is a controversial topic. Many experts dismiss the science and say that they can indeed beat the market. Some of them may even do so for a year or two, or even five, but what about over the long run? It&rsquo;s simply not sustainable, and to think otherwise is dangerous.</p><p> If the data shows that the vast majority of the brightest and most well-equipped professional investors can&rsquo;t beat their benchmarks, why should you believe anyone who says they can?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Leon Morales </u></p><h3> It has been more than seven years since the financial crisis, yet some firms continue to have significant violations due to poor cultures of compliance, FINRA Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Ketchum said in a statement. <br/>  </h3><p> \"This year, FINRA will be looking for firms to focus on their culture and whether it is putting customers first and promoting risk management adaptable to a changing business environment,\" Mr. Ketchum said.</p><p> Recognizing that all of us have behavioral biases that are unique; building a firm culture can be one of the most important goals of the Financial Advisory Firm. Using  <u>  People analytics </u>  to develop a client-centered solution breeds a culture of increased AUM without sacrificing integrity and authenticity of the firm goals.</p><p> This latest move comes after the Wall Street regulator listed firm culture as a 2016 examination priority. FINRA has defined culture as firm norms-those practices and behaviors within the workplace that have a &ldquo;profound influence&rdquo; on how firms run their business and manage conflicts.</p><p> FINRA is asking firms to provide information <u>  <a href=\"http://securitiescompliancesentinel.foxrothschild.com/compliance-and-supervision/culture-shock-finra-begins-targeted-enforcement-of-firm-culture/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">    around eight general areas  </a> </u> , including the polices in place that establish firm culture, how those core values are communicated and in what ways the firm measures and assesses the impact of those standards.</p><p> <strong>  Use these suggestions to develop your own &ldquo;Cheat Sheet&rdquo; to ensure you are proactive in meeting these objectives. </strong></p><p> 1. Use a validated Risk Profile Solution that assists the Advisor in identifying the best-suited investments that match the client&rsquo;s natural risk tolerance and return requirements, thereby, reducing complaints later on when the client&rsquo;s natural behavior surfaces and he/she reacts negatively.</p><p> 2. Create a platform with transparency into those Risk Profile and Behavioral Bias factors for both the Advisor and the Client. This will provide documentation of an environment that is focused the true Client needs, as well as, how the Advisor might be biased differently than the Client. Identifying mismatches and performing periodic reviews of transactions based upon this information will ensure accountability for the Advisor not to place the client in a non-suited investment.</p><p> 3. Develop a behavioral bias learning environment so that the Advisors understand how hard-wired behavior is a major factor in how the client will react to different investments and market volatility. This can be done by using a behavioral bias discovery process and engaging the client in the process to help manage their emotions and expectations.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> For the past couple of years, I have been honoured to participate in Implement Now, a virtual summit that brings together thought leaders and subject matter experts across a wide range of practice management areas. <br/>  </h3><p> This article provides additional details and links for my 2016 discussion with summit organizer Kristin Harad on the topic of how to curate great content. </p><p> In this article, I will cover the following topics:</p><li> Six reasons WHY you should curate content</li><li> WHAT topics you should be sharing</li><li> WHERE you can go to find great content</li><li> HOW to curate and share content effectively</li><li> HOW frequently you should share content</li><li> HOW to measure the results of curation</li><h3> Six reasons WHY you should curate content <br/>  </h3><p> Curation is a foundational social networking strategy for adding value to your network and increasing your visibility. The target audience for your curation activities include your existing clients, as well as centers of influencer, prospects and professional peers. Content curation is NOT marketing. It is much more about building and enhancing your reputation.</p><p> Before we launch into the details about how to curate and share content, I want to review the key reasons WHY a financial professional would want to make content curation a fundamental basis of their social networking strategy.</p><br /><p> <strong>  Here are six reasons that you should consider: </strong></p><p> 1. Shows people what you know &ndash; Consistently finding and sharing high quality content related to topics about which you are knowledgeable actually demonstrates your knowledge. Writing original content is not the only way to exhibit subject matter expertise and thought leadership.</p><p> 2. Adds value to &ldquo;too much information&rdquo; &ndash; We live in a world where information is so plentiful that it can overwhelm people and actually lose value. Sifting through the vast amounts of information and sharing only the best content is truly creating value when people are overloaded by too much information.</p><p> 3. A generous act of giving &ndash; You know the feeling of gratitude you have when someone recommends a book to you and you read it and just love it? Sharing great content with people is similar. People feel gratitude toward you when you share something that answers their questions or helps them.</p><p> 4. Share and show your personality &ndash; Many financial advisory businesses are built on relationships. And people need to know you, like you and trust you in order to want to do business with you. Curation is a great way to show not only what you know, but how you think and what you care about. Showing some personality gives people something personal to like, something they can relate to.</p><p> 5. Drives engagement &ndash; By actively sharing interesting, funny and thoughtful content in social networks, you create opportunities to engage people in discussions. It is precisely these discussions that allow you to nurture and deepen relationships within your social network.</p><p> 6. Increases visibility &ndash; Let&rsquo;s face it, people are busy and their attention is limited. Frequent sharing of high quality content in social networks is one strategy for staying visible and gaining attention. Even if people are not clicking on every article you share, they are aware you are there and trying to add value.</p><p> Now that I&rsquo;ve clarified WHY curation of content is such an important part of one&rsquo;s social networking strategy, let&rsquo;s turn to how to put in place a system for sharing great content consistently.</p><h3> What topics you should be sharing <br/>  </h3><p> Determining what topics you should be sharing is the first step in building a curation plan.</p><p> The most important question to consider when sharing content is this:</p><p> <strong>  WHAT DOES YOUR AUDIENCE WANT? </strong></p><p> Many financial professionals mistakenly approach social networking as a marketing activity and fall into the trap of focussing too much on sharing content on topics that tie back to products or services that they sell.</p><p> Curation will be an effective strategy for you to be visible and get people&rsquo;s attention only if you focus primarily on what information they want. Of course, you should also focus on topics that you know about. So the intersection of what your audience wants and what you have knowledge about is the sweet spot for content curation.</p><br /><p> Here are some ideas for curation topics in which your audience is likely to have some interest:</p><li> Personal finance &ndash; Topics like budgeting, tax planning, and retirement planning are of interest to a wide range of people.</li><li> Financial literacy &ndash; I love topics related to financial literacy, especially how to teach kids good money habits, because these topics are likely to be shared among parents or even inter-generationally between grandparents and their adult children with kids.</li><li> Productivity tips &ndash; Almost everyone works for a living, so good ideas about how they can adopt more productive work strategies and habits is of interest to many people.</li><li> Networking tips &ndash; Similarly, networking is an importance activity in many business and professional settings and fresh new ideas about how to make effective connections is popular content.</li><li> Leadership &ndash; This is one of those topics that works wonders. It both helps you demonstrate leadership qualities in yourself, while also attracting people who see themselves as leaders.</li><li> Health and fitness &ndash; Many of us could stand to get more exercise and/or lose a few pounds, so topics such as how to eat well when travelling on business or two-minute stretches you can do in your office are very popular.</li><li> Happiness and the good life &ndash; People&rsquo;s life goals often revolve around being happy, living a good life and having a rich family life. Finances are seen as merely a path to these life goals. Focus on people&rsquo;s true life goals.</li><p> Curation is about finding great content and sharing it. It presents you with an opportunity to share your interests and personality with your audience. All people have personal interests above and beyond their professional expertise. Perhaps you are interested in a certain period in history or an historical figure, perhaps technology and gadgets, or sports, or space exploration, or fine wine and dining. Maybe you&rsquo;re an amateur musician or a hobbyist of some kind. You may have some community causes that are near and dear to your heart. These are all potentially good topics to integrate into your content curation because the reveal something about YOU that some members of your audience can relate to.</p><p> Finally, I always recommend that people look for content that is &ldquo;evergreen&rdquo; &ndash; that is, it stands the test of time and would be as relevant in a month or a year as it is now. That is not to say that you should never share timely information that is relevant; of course, you should. But content that is not tied to a particular event or date can often serve you well over a longer period of time.</p><h3> WHERE you can find great content to share <br/>  </h3><p> There is no shortage of great content to share online, but finding it among the vast amounts of boring and unremarkable content can be a challenge.</p><p> Of course, what constitutes &ldquo;great content&rdquo; is somewhat subjective and open to each person&rsquo;s opinion and perspective. I obviously bring my own biases to this discussion, but I also bring a lot of experience pouring through content to find just the right content to share with my own clients and prospects.</p><p> Here are some strategies I have used to find great content online:</p><p> <strong>  1. Find content on LinkedIn Pulse </strong></p><p> Most financial professionals are already using LinkedIn regularly and the Pulse news section of LinkedIn offers lots of relevant, easy-to-share content for your network. It can be tricky to find the LinkedIn Pulse section because of the notoriously awful user interface and navigation within LinkedIn, but if you log in to LinkedIn and click  <u>  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/discover/ </u>  you should get there.</p><br /><p> LinkedIn Pulse allows you to follow thought leaders (such as Richard Branson, Sallie Krawcheck, Mohamed El-Erian, etc.), channels (including topic areas such as Leadership &amp; Management, Economy, Banking &amp; Finance, etc.) and even individual publications (eg., Harvard Business Review, The Economist, The New York Times, etc.) and then makes suggestions of content you may be interested in. A regular visit to LinkedIn Pulse will usually reveal an article or two worth sharing to your LinkedIn network.</p><p> <strong>  2. Use Twitter to share what influencers share </strong></p><p> Twitter is widely used as a way for people to share content with their audience and this makes it a great place to find great content to share with your audience.</p><p> Start by finding influencers and thought leaders on Twitter that are sharing good content in areas that are of interest to you. This takes some time, but you don&rsquo;t need to find thousands or even hundreds of these influencers on Twitter. All you need is to follow a dozen or so active Twitter sharers to find some good content to share with your audience.</p><p> Once you have identified your best Twitter sources of relevant content, you can track them conveniently using a Twitter list. Create a Twitter List for any group of Twitter accounts you want to pay attention to and then view that list to see only those users&rsquo; Tweets. Twitter Lists can be public or private. If public, then the Twitter accounts you add to the list will be notified and anyone can see the list on your Twitter account. If private, no notification is sent to users when you add the to the list and only you can see the list. Private Twitter Lists are a great tool for monitoring a small number of high-value Twitter accounts.</p><p> Finally, Twitter makes it easy to mention the author or source of a great piece of content that you share and you should not miss an opportunity to give credit where credit is due. One of the greatest benefits of curation is engagement. Mentioning content creators or other sharers is one of the best (and easiest) ways to build engagement in your network.</p><br /><p> Note: Twitter has recently introduced a curator tool of its own for identifying Tweets in a particular topic and curating a stream of public Tweets that can be embedded on your website. To try it out for yourself, login to Twitter and visit  <u>  Twitter Curator </u> . This video offers basic instruction in how to use Twitter Curator.</p><p> <strong>  3. Strategic searching with Google Alerts </strong></p><p> Google Alerts have been rumored to be on the chopping block for some time now, but while they are still around they are a useful tool for identifying topical content to share.</p><p> Google Alerts basically allow you to create a Google search and have the updated result emailed to you on a regular basis (weekly, daily or as they happen). In my experience, Google Alerts can be very helpful when you are looking for very specific search terms, for instance if you are monitoring for references to a person&rsquo;s name (perhaps your own) or a specific company. It&rsquo;s great to have this information emailed to you as soon as Google registers it in their search engine.</p><br /><p> However, broad search terms are far less effective in Google Alerts. Much like a broad search term might return results that contain the keywords, many of the results can be irrelevant to what you&rsquo;re looking for. Google Alerts suffers the same problem and often requires you to spend additional time to filter the results that are emailed to you. This can still be a source of great content discovery, but often involves more time than you may have.</p><p> To access Google Alerts, login to Google and visit  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/alerts\" target=\"_blank\">   https://www.google.com/alerts  </a> </u>  then you can add, edit or delete any number of alerts.</p><h3> 4. Curate the curators <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most reliable ways to find great content to share is to pay attention to others that are curating content. Curate other curators. After all, they&rsquo;ve already poured through vast amounts of content and picked out what they think is best. These kinds of lists represent powerful shortcuts to finding great content for your audience.</p><p> Here are a few of my top sources of amazing content for my audience:</p><li> Dave Pell&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://nextdraft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   NextDraft  </a> </u>  &ndash; Dave curates a free daily newsletter with at least 10 links to topical and high-quality news stories.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/best-newsletters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   20 curated newsletters  </a> </u>  &ndash; Dave Pell isn&rsquo;t the only one curating content for free. Buffer has compiled 20 of the best free newsletters with content to share, including Atlantic editor Alexis Madrigal and Austin Kleon.</li><li> <u>  What the NYT are reading </u>  &ndash; Who wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in what editors and writers at the NYTs are reading? You can subscribe and they&rsquo;ll tell you.</li><li> What Tadas Viskantas is reading &ndash; Blogger Tadas Viskantas maintains a popular financial blog entitled  <u>  <a href=\"http://abnormalreturns.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AbnormalReturns.com  </a> </u>  in which he curates content virtually every day. This is a treasure trove of high quality content.</li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://ritholtz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ritholtz&rsquo;s Big Picture  </a> </u>  &ndash; Barry Ritholtz is an influential financial blogger that regularly shares his morning and evening reading. This stuff is gold!</li><h3> How to curate and share content effectively <br/>  </h3><p> Social networking platforms are designed for sharing content. Located at the top of LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and virtually any social network is a place for you to share your thoughts and ideas, or an article you want your audience to read. Native sharing like this is fine, but it&rsquo;s time consuming and since it all happens in real time you need to dedicate more time to sharing throughout the day and week.</p><p> Many regulated financial advisors may have a compliance-mandated social media platform that they are required to use in order to share content to their social accounts used for business purposes. There are a variety of such platforms in common use, including  <u>  <a href=\"http://hearsaysocial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hearsay Social  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://socialware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Socialware  </a> </u> , etc., but this article will not cover the specifics of using any of these platforms.</p><p> Instead, I want to focus on how to curate content to a variety of social networks and will highlight the use of  <u>  <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Buffer  </a> </u>  as a tool for scheduling and distributing curated content to your audience.</p><p> The goal in curating content is to create a continuous stream of high value content for your audience and to do this in as efficient a manner as possible. Content needs to be distributed continuously and consistently to your social networks so you maintain visibility.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve found Buffer to be the ideal platform for managing this distribution of curated content. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d suggest you use Buffer. First, create a Buffer account and connect your social network profiles to your Buffer account (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ pages, etc.).</p><p> Then, for each social account, you can set up a schedule for sharing which acts like a queue. Say you want to share 3 times a day to Twitter, at 7:30 am, 1:30 pm and 9:00 pm, and you want this to be your schedule for all 7 days of the week. That means each week you have 21 slots to fill in your Twitter distribution schedule with high quality content. Each time you add content via Buffer, it will go to the end of your Twitter queue. (Note: In the sample screen below, I have 9 scheduled Twitter sharing slots each day, for a total of 63 slots for the week.)</p><br /><p> Working with this kind of scheduling system allows you to sit down on Sunday, for example, and find 21 great pieces of content you want to share. Then you can let Buffer distribute those shares to Twitter at the pre-set times through the week and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about maintaining your Twitter feed manually. This is a highly efficient way to share content with your audience.</p><p> This same queuing mechanism applies to all of your social accounts. You set the schedule and then add the content and Buffer distributes it.</p><h3> How frequently should you share content <br/>  </h3><p> One of the most common questions I&rsquo;m asked is how frequently you should share content to your social accounts.</p><p> There is no hard and fast rules about frequency of content sharing. Some studies have suggested more frequent sharing sharing is beneficial, but to a limit. Other studies suggest that sharing on certain days and at certain times times produces better engagement, but the benefits are typically marginal.</p><p> In my own experience, I find engagement can come at any time of day, depending on the quality of the content. Weekends are as good a time as weekdays to share for a similar reason that early mornings or later evenings are good times to share: busy people are often catching up on social network activity they may have previously missed.</p><p> In the end, each person needs to find the right frequency that works for them and their audience.</p><p> However, I would suggest that you consider the characteristics of the social networking platforms you are sharing to. Twitter, for instance, is by its nature a higher frequency platform. Most of your Tweets are not going to be seen by the vast majority of your audience since people typically use Twitter sporadically through the day. In order to be visible to more of your audience, you need to be Tweeting more frequently throughout the day.</p><p> Sharing once a day or once every few days is not going to help your visibility on Twitter, whereas sharing 3, 6 or even 12 times a day on Twitter will increase the likelihood of your Tweets being seen.</p><p> LinkedIn is typically less of a frequency medium, but sharing more frequently can also work on LinkedIn. Sharing valuable content, say, one to three times a day on LinkedIn will help you stay visible while not annoying your connections.</p><p> And this is where everyone needs to find their own comfort zone with sharing frequency. Your followers and connections have complete power to tune you out if you are boring or annoying them. So stop worrying about over-sharing. If you are truly committed to finding and sharing great content and adding value to your networks and audience, the quality of your sharing will encourage people to stay connected with you even if they feel you over-share a bit. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;d always recommend starting slow and gradually ramping up the frequency.</p><p> One final note on re-sharing. Most social networks exercise some form of filtering so that not all of your content reaches all of your connections, followers and friends. And not everyone is online all the time waiting to read what you are sharing.</p><p> Buffer&rsquo;s data analysis tools (based on data they get from your social accounts) can tell you which shares get the most engagement. Your most popular shares are giving you feedback that shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored. People clicking on and re-sharing content means they LIKE that content. You should be re-sharing your most popular content in your networks because of this feedback. On Twitter, you can re-share a popular Tweet, perhaps with a slight variation on the text. Same on LinkedIn or Facebook. This is one key way for you to get clarification about what content your audience wants.</p><h3> How to measure results of curation <br/>  </h3><p> The proper measure of success in curation activities is engagement. How many people are viewing your content &ndash; what is its reach? How many people are clicking on or sharing your content &ndash; is engagement with your content rising?</p><p> We&rsquo;ve already touched on how Buffer can be used to gauge engagement and then leverage this data to re-share popular content.</p><p> Twitter offers detailed analytics (https://analytics.twitter.com/) for measuring engagement for each Tweet. Dividing the total number of engagements by the total number of impressions for a given Tweet, Twitter calculates an engagement rate for each Tweet. A variety of other audience metrics are available via the Twitter analytics site.</p><br /><p> LinkedIn Premium accounts offer some analytics related to profile views and shared content in your activity feed. Profile views on LinkedIn is a reasonable way to get at overall engagement since it represents some level of interest in you. LinkedIn also allows people to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; you without being a connection and that&rsquo;s another good measure of engagement. Followers on LinkedIn receive automatic updates when you publish long form articles on LinkedIn or share content on your activity feed.</p><p> Finally, you&rsquo;ll know you are having success with your curation activities when you start to receive anecdotal reports from your network that they appreciate the content you are sharing. You will meet with a client or receive a call from a prospect and they will mention that they like the content you are sharing and find it very valuable. You can be assured that there are others in your network that feel the same way.</p><p> Keep it up. Return on your investment in finding and sharing great content is within reach!</p>",

    "link": "5-tips-on-how-not-to-sound-like-a-salesperson",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> First, let&rsquo;s start with the real problem which is that most sales reps just don&rsquo;t know how to really engage and talk to people. That&rsquo;s really the bottom line.</h3><p> <br/> Most sales reps are more interested in pitching their products or services and don&rsquo;t treat the people they are speaking with like people. A long time ago, my first sales manager gave me a great lesson in how to talk to and treat people. He said, &ldquo;People are just people. They are just like you. They want to be respected, they want to be listened to, and they don&rsquo;t want to be sold to. Show a real interest in them and treat them with kindness and you&rsquo;ll go a long way&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> What&rsquo;s so interesting, however, is that although this sounds so easy to do, for some reason, sales reps seem afraid to engage and ask questions of prospects because they think that as soon as they give them an opening they are going to get the door shut in their face. Most aren&rsquo;t going to be interested &ndash; as we know &ndash; but many are. The way to deal with both of them is to learn how to engage and just talk to them.</p><p> Here are five tips and scripts that will help you get better at the crucial skill of relating to people so you don&rsquo;t sound like a sales rep. Use these and you&rsquo;ll soon find yourself way ahead of your competition. Here are some tips for working with gatekeepers:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Tip number one is to always, always use please and thank you &ndash; especially with gatekeepers.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> In fact, the more times you use the word please in your opening, &ldquo;Hi, could I please speak with _________, please?&rdquo; the more successful you&rsquo;ll become. The more polite you are with the gatekeeper, the more polite and helpful they will be with you&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  2. The second way to work with gatekeepers is to use the &ldquo;I need a little bit of help please,&rdquo; technique.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The key to using this is that you have to stop here and wait for the other person to respond. You&rsquo;d be surprised by how many people use this technique but combine it with, &ldquo;I need to speak with the person who&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> This doesn&rsquo;t work. This doesn&rsquo;t engage the person on the other end of the phone. You absolutely must give the other person a chance to respond to you before you continue.</p><h3> <strong>  3. When you do get the decision maker on the phone, please, do not use that tired old phrase, &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Nothing identifies you as a disinterested salesperson more than that worn out line. Instead, use this:</p><p> &ldquo;Hi is that ________? Hi _________, this is _______ _______ with ___________, how&rsquo;s your Monday (or day of the week) going so far?&rdquo;</p><p> Now I know it sounds like the same thing but it is not. First, no one is saying it, and because you&rsquo;re talking about the current day they are in, you can almost hear them think about their day and answer honestly. If they ask you how your Monday is going as well, always thank them for asking first before you move into your script.</p><p> Again, this may seem like a small technique, but it makes a BIG impact.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Introduce the reason you&rsquo;re calling in as short of a time as possible and then ask them an engaging question. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Most sales reps start their calls with a paragraph or two description and this is where the &ldquo;speaking at&rdquo; people comes in. Instead, mix your opening up with something like:</p><p> &ldquo;__________, briefly, the reason I&rsquo;m calling you is that I see on LinkedIn that you run an inside sales department and I was just wondering how often you work with outside trainers or consultants to help you improve your results?&rdquo;</p><p> The key here is to get them involved in the conversation early &ndash; even if you fear a negative response. And ALWAYS hit your mute button and let them talk&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  5. The last tip for today is to always be prepared for the objections you get with a scripted response that doesn&rsquo;t challenge your prospect, but rather, that allows them to feel heard and respected. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s how you can handle the, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested,&rdquo; objection:</p><p> &ldquo;No problem _________. Please realize that I&rsquo;m not calling to sell you anything today, rather, I&rsquo;m just calling to see if what we have might be a good fit for you and if I can help you down the line. Let me ask you&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p> Do you see how this doesn&rsquo;t push back on them? Using a response like this will get you much further than challenging them as so many sales reps still tend to do.</p><p> By using the above techniques (and developing many more), you&rsquo;ll begin to actually have conversations with the people you speak with and you&rsquo;ll differentiate yourself from the hundreds of other sales reps who are pitching and annoying them. This will make their day, and yours, much more enjoyable and profitable.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Let&rsquo;s take it back to 1997, when the first recognizable social media site was born &ndash; Six Degrees (it actually goes way back depending on your definition of social media, but let&rsquo;s start here).  It wasn&rsquo;t a great success, but it touched on everything we consider social media to be today.  It enabled users to create a profile, invite friends, organize groups, and search other users&rsquo; profiles&hellip;all to be better connected.  It was essentially based on a theory that no one is separated by more than 6 degrees of one another. </p><p> Since 1997, the concept of social media hasn&rsquo;t changed much, but the growth in this space within the last 2 decades has proved that it&rsquo;s here to stay.  Who knows what social networking will look like in the next decade, but it&rsquo;s clear that as long as there is supply and demand (for just about anything), there will be a need to have a digital brand, share information globally, and measure what&rsquo;s resonating efficiently.  Social media went from being rejected to &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just a fad&rsquo; to an inescapable obsession to the most necessary tool in the toolbox for both individuals and businesses&hellip;in a matter of few years.</p><p> <strong>  &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a choice on whether we do social media, the question is how well we do it.&rdquo;  - Erik Qualman </strong></p><p> Today, most companies understand that they have to invest in social programs, despite the hazy ROI models.  Of course, there are still some non-believers (perhaps just waiting for the numbers to work), but they&rsquo;re probably a lost cause now.  If your leaders haven&rsquo;t committed to social media yet, then it&rsquo;s safe to say they are doing you and the business a disservice.  They are truly setting you up for failure.</p><p> But what does &lsquo;investing in social media&rsquo; mean?  There are 4 components to a successful social media strategy:</p><h3> <strong>  Presence </strong></h3><p> <br/> The first step in doing anything on social media is having a presence, and figuring out which one to start with can be overwhelming.  In the beginning, all you need is just ONE presence on the RIGHT social channel.  So identify the right network by asking these questions:</p><li> What networks does the industry have a presence in? (Find out how businesses present themselves, how they engage, and if it&rsquo;s working)</li><li> What networks are my clients/customers on? (Simply ask them and use social network demographic data)</li><li> Does it make sense for my brand and content? (Think through how you want to deliver your message &amp; knowledge&hellip;images, videos, firm-curated articles, personalized private messages?) <br/>  </li><p> Then, pick the best fitting network:</p><li> Personal &amp; Professional: Facebook, Twitter</li><li> Just Business: LinkedIn</li><li> Image-based: Instagram, Pinterest</li><li> Video-based: YouTube, Vine</li><li> Location-based: Yelp, Foursquare</li><li> Audio-based: Podcast, Anchor</li><li> Interest-based: Google+ <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Content </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once you have a presence, it&rsquo;s essential to engage your network.  Unfortunately, just having a profile still means you&rsquo;re invisible to the world, but the moment you post your thoughts, you&rsquo;re on-air worldwide.  Imagine the social landscape as a big, never-ending cocktail party, where your presence is equal to attending a free event that everyone was invited to (not so special), but as soon as you share your story and knowledge, you attract a nice group around you.  There&rsquo;s some back and forth, lots of learning about each other, and then, all of a sudden, you stop talking.  Your group, naturally, scurries away because you are no longer interesting.  On the other hand, picture yourself talking too much and not letting others speak.  You&rsquo;re now irrelevant.</p><p> The key to growing and sustaining your network is sharing valuable, authentic thought leadership in a consistent manner.  Content can come in all shapes and sizes - a tweet to acknowledge something, a comment to Congratulate, a blog post to express original ideas, a reshare of a CNN editorial, a firm-branded article, or even a private one-on-one message &ndash; but if you continuously track what is working within your network and find the right balance, you&rsquo;ll be the life of the party.  Typically, depending on your industry, organizations may limit you to a content library or mandate pre-approval on your self-authored messages.  And this is perfectly fine&hellip;as long as the library is fully stocked with compelling, fresh content and there is a well-resourced team to review your free form messages real-time.</p><h3> <strong>  Analytics </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here&rsquo;s where it gets tricky &ndash; businesses tend to do a good job with establishing a social presence and offering quality content, but dollars seem to run out right about now.  Most organizations don&rsquo;t invest resources, time, and technology into social analytics&hellip;and this is where we can finally measure ROI!  Let me be clear, when I say &lsquo;social analytics&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m not just thinking about the number of likes, comments, shares, and impressions, I&rsquo;m thinking big&hellip;Big Data&hellip;big. </p><p> With a well-defined strategy, your organization should develop predictive social analytic models to effectively listen, gather, assess, and respond to social behaviors and engagement.  This would help you build a complete view of an individual&rsquo;s needs and identify business opportunities at the right time.  For example, Lynn shares a picture of a beautiful ring on Instagram with #isaidyes, #engaged, and #2018wedding hashtags.  This one post can conclude that she&rsquo;ll be in the market for a wedding dress, wedding bands, photographers, perhaps a wedding planner, maybe even honeymoon destinations, etc.  If businesses offering these products or services tracked &lsquo;engagement&rsquo; hashtags or phrases, they would easily be able to create targeted campaigns, increasing the chances of winning Lynn as a customer.  If you&rsquo;re a financial advisor, let&rsquo;s say, it&rsquo;s the perfect time to present a Facebook ad about &lsquo;determining a couple&rsquo;s risk-tolerance&rsquo;.  If Lynn or her fianc&eacute; are fiscally responsible, she may click the ad to complete the risk assessment, generating enough information for the advisor to reach out and potentially secure a good prospect.</p><h3> <strong>  Integration </strong></h3><p> <br/> There&rsquo;s so much that social media can offer, but when it&rsquo;s interwoven with the way you do business, magic happens.  Similar to analytics, organizations rarely get this far.  However, when they start integrating social presence, content, and analytics to existing practices, companies turn into true &lsquo;social businesses&rsquo;.  This means that they have stopped looking at social media as just a marketing channel, and have realized that when it&rsquo;s plugged into the firm&rsquo;s CRM system, customer service plans, supply chain communication routines, internally-built applications, etc, employees are much more productive and transparent.  Along with improving internal processes, the biggest benefit of an integrated social business is the seamless experience you can offer to your clients/customers. </p><p> Let&rsquo;s go back to being a financial advisor &ndash; when Lynn clicked on the Facebook ad, she was directed to my website where she can learn more about me and access the risk assessment.  Later I get an alert notifying me that Lynn viewed my LinkedIn profile, followed by the results of her risk assessment (so she did complete it!).  This prompted the system to ask if I wanted to create an account for Lynn in our CRM (yes, please!).  Since she viewed my LinkedIn profile, I also visit her page to get to know her more and then send her a private message.  I mention a few common interests, the risk assessment results, and ask if she would like to connect.  This message automatically gets saved in her CRM record, along with every other conversation I (or anyone else in the organization) have through email, text, phone, social, and in-person thereafter.  Even with this basic kind of integration, the journey for you and your prospective client will surely be personal, memorable, and consistent.</p><p> Overall, if your organization&rsquo;s social media strategy doesn&rsquo;t consider these 4 factors, the hazy ROI model we previously temporarily ignored will continue to be unclear.  In order to fully take advantage of what social media has to offer today and perhaps be ready for the next decade, companies have to become a social business. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Substantial change in the business world is nothing new. What&rsquo;s new are change drivers and the speed of change.</h3><p> <br/> The practice of &lsquo;change management&rsquo; has been utilized for many years to help organizations process and successfully implement changes as broadly and deeply as specific changes warranted.</p><p> However, prior change management strategies and methods aren&rsquo;t capable of addressing the vast changes organizations face today.</p><p> Today digital trends &ndash; AKA &ldquo;the digitization of everything&rdquo; &ndash; are primary drivers in the synchronized growth of multiple technology innovations. If harnessed right, these innovations will enable companies to engage with customers better, faster and on a broader scale. And, digital tools help gather the right customer information, use it to achieve a deeper customer understanding, and respond with better, more personalized customer experiences and greater contextual relevance. Looking forward, the inability to execute at this level will reduce offerings to commodities with little customer value.</p><h3> Implications to Organization Structure</h3><p> <br/> Company leaders who comprehend the extent of change required also understand inherent challenges in developing a comprehensive and flexible digital strategy that obsoletes current business and operating models. Embracing a digital environment mandates correct and simultaneous execution of numerous individual tasks, requires complete cross-channel connectivity and continuous customer, supplier, employee and stakeholder engagement. No small feat. Highly talented leadership is required to focus innovation and differentiation, prioritize investments and effectively communicate the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; throughout their organizations.</p><p> PwC&rsquo;s 2015 Digital IQ&reg; Survey* identified 10 critical capabilities correlated with strong financial performance. Survey results showed huge disparity between &ldquo;Digital IQ&reg; Leaders&rdquo; and study laggards. Leaders &ndash; who embraced and implemented these 10 attributes in their organizations &ndash; realized revenue and profit growth at twice the rate of study laggards.</p><h3> 10 Critical Digital Attributes</h3><p> <br/> 1. CEO champion <br/> 2. Digital leaders set strategy <br/> 3. Executive team engaged <br/> 4. Strategy-sharing across organization <br/> 5. Outside-in approach <br/> 6. Driven by competitive advantage <br/> 7. Effective use of business data <br/> 8. Proactive cybersecurity <br/> 9. Digital roadmap <br/> 10. Consistent measurement</p><h3> PwC&rsquo;s Digital IQ survey also identified the top three reasons businesses are pursuing rapid digital integration:</h3><p> <br/> 1. Grow revenue 45% <br/> 2. Create better customer experiences 25% <br/> 3. Increase profits 12%</p><h3> Implications for the Workforce</h3><p> <br/> The extensive changes required to transform a business &ndash; from business model through everyday tasks &ndash; into an agile and responsive team environment of constant changes is a formidable challenge for business leaders in every industry.</p><p> However, leaders in high-tech industries, such as telecom, feel even greater pressure to execute quickly, smoothly and comprehensively.</p><p> Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T&rsquo;s chairman and CEO** believes complete reinvention is the only way toward a successful future. He views obsolescence as the alternative. However, achieving such a huge goal will require retraining AT&amp;T&rsquo;s 280,000 employees. Mr. Stephenson doesn&rsquo;t mince words. He believes employees will soon need to be able to make swift business decisions in the face of a &ldquo;fire hose of data&rdquo; continuously coming into the company. Continuous learning is not optional.</p><p> Two years ago AT&amp;T began a program that helps pay for some of the education and new skills required for employees in many future AT&amp;T jobs. In a recent interview, Mr. Stephenson voiced his views.</p><p> &ldquo;There is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning will obsolete themselves with technology.&rdquo;</p><p> Not surprisingly, some employees around during AT&amp;T&rsquo;s numerous breakups and reinventions aren&rsquo;t interested in participating in yet another reinvention of &ldquo;old Ma Bell.&rdquo; Some, close to retirement, can hold out. Others will likely have few career options without obtaining new skills.</p><h3> Future</h3><p> <br/> Looking forward, businesses must adapt, learn, retool, repeat&hellip;or face failure.</p><h3> Action Items:</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  1. Evaluate employees&rsquo; current knowledge status relative to that needed for future success. </strong> Identify ways to effectively communicate to different employee groups what will be required in the future for jobs similar to those they hold now.</p><p> <strong>  2. Prioritize future increased technology (and other) skill needs. </strong> Focus first on the areas, levels and specific job functions where the need is greatest &ndash; and failing to increase skill sets is likely to create business issues first.</p><p> <strong>  3. Develop a plan to help employees gain the required knowledge and skills. </strong> Help can include holding courses at work, allowing employees to take courses nearby during work hours, paying for some or all of the cost of their education, helping with related situations and expenses such as daycare, caregiving, etc. Given the sizeable investment the company has for employees, it&rsquo;s important for the company to very prominently demonstrate its investment &ndash; not only in future job skills &ndash; but also in valuing each employee willing to make this future commitment. <br/>  </p><a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/advisory/2015-global-digital-iq-survey/key-findings.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> *PwC 2015 Digital IQ Survey</a><br/>**Hardy, Quentin, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/technology/gearing-up-for-the-cloud-att-tells-its-workers-adapt-or-else.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\"> Gearing Up for the Cloud, AT&amp;T Tells Its Workers: Adapt, or Else</a>, The New York Times, February 13, 2016",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  &ldquo;Robo advisory&rdquo; is the internet interface of investing, a new breed of online financial advisors who use computer models and algorithms to both design and manage investment portfolios. </strong> Successfully competing in this new investing environment will demand:</p><li> An understanding of the power of branding in professional services and development of the marketing tools necessary to build and support your brand;</li><li> Commitment to increased scalability through use of increasingly sophisticated technology; and</li><li> Multichannel delivery systems with a multigenerational and multitalented advisory team to straddle the growing age range and preferences of profitable investors. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  &ldquo;It is change, continuing change, inevitable change that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be.&rdquo; &mdash; ISAAC ASIMOV </strong></p><p> Maybe nowhere is Asimov&rsquo;s advice more apropos than in the wealth management industry today. Financial advisors face mounting challenges in all phases of their business, from scalability and pricing issues to paradigm shifts in client behaviors and expectations. Time-tested business models are being questioned due to enhanced technological innovation, increasing availability of big data and the stunning, continued growth of the number of financial products available.</p><p> Perhaps none of these issues has received as much scrutiny for its disruptive power as the rise of the so-called &ldquo;robo advisory.&rdquo; Speculation that computers may make human advisors obsolete has attracted major media attention. Venture-capital-backed robo startups are proliferating. Whether the opinion of the majority of investors will shift &mdash; and is followed by action &mdash; remains to be seen. Nevertheless, even though high-net-worth investors are currently the lifeblood of the professional advisory business, next-gen investors are coming of age and cannot be ignored. The &ldquo;mass affluent&rdquo; population next-gen investors now represent in large numbers is a powerful source of potential growth for these high-tech online advisors.</p><p> There is no question that the times, as Bob Dylan sang, &ldquo;they are a changin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Is your practice prepared to meet the challenge? Here&rsquo;s how you can respond to this new competitor and even thrive in the new wealth management landscape.</p><h3> <strong>  What is Robo Advisory? </strong></h3><p> <br/> You may have read the headlines about financial analysts and advisors being &ldquo;replaced by robots.&rdquo; What exactly is this new upstart technology?</p><p> Simply put, robo advisory is the internet interface of investing. A new breed of online financial advisors uses computer models and algorithms to both design and manage investment portfolios. Many provide automatic portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting; some offer &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; services for larger investors, adding in a human advisor who can assist with detailed portfolio reviews and fund selection processes. Common among them is that all have lowered the bar on investment minimums.</p><p> Starting an investment relationship with a robo firm often begins with a simple online questionnaire that establishes goals and objectives as well as tolerance for risk. Coupled with vastly different gradations of service, access and interactivity, it is somewhat difficult for individual investors to determine the best choice for their needs.</p><p> In addition to the savings inherent in their automated business models, robo advisors tend to invest in vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p> A decreased cost for investing plus the ease of online access present an acknowledged attraction for some investors. But what else is driving this swift rise to notoriety? And what can we expect the growing impact to be? First, let&rsquo;s set some context.</p><h3> <strong>  Who Uses Robo Advisors? </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> The most commonly reported characterization of a robo advisor&rsquo;s target is the mass affluent and mass market investor who doesn&rsquo;t meet the typical minimum investable assets criteria of professional financial advisors and fiduciary managers. These individuals are, on average, younger; very technically savvy; value ease and convenience; and don&rsquo;t mind getting investment advisory services online or via an interactive voice response (IVR) without any human intervention. 1</p><p> Corroborating that view are descriptions of client bases from two of the more successful robo advisor startup firms: 2</p><li> Firm 1 &ndash; 75% of clients are younger than 50, with an average age of 30-something and work as professionals earning approximately $150,000 per year; fees range from 0.15% to 0.35%, depending on account size</li><li> Firm 2 &ndash; 90% of clients are under age 50; 60% under 35; no advisory fees are charged on the first $10,000 but larger amounts of assets under management are charged 0.25% Research shows, however, that digital channels should not be thought of as only for Gen X and Gen Y. Boomers own their fair share of tech devices and should not be ignored. 3</li><p>  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-10.32.50-AM-2.png\" width=\"512\"/></p><p>  </p><p> One of the surprising turns many upstart robo firms are taking is offering their low-cost automated services to financial advisory firms. Other robo firms have begun to offer their own staffed advisory platforms, creating hybrid high-tech/high-touch offerings that may appeal to younger boomers as well as Gen X and Millennials as these groups accumulate wealth and develop more complex asset management needs.</p><h3> <strong>  The Evolution of the Investment Management in Industry </strong></h3><p> <br/> The investment management industry has undergone serious change across several decades, but no more so than the game-changing developments of the last several years. The recent bull market has been a key driver fueling the changes along with increased regulation, changing consumer behavior, advancements in technology and a dramatically more complex competitive landscape. 4</p><h3> <strong>  Regulatory Challenges </strong></h3><p> <br/> Reaction to the 2008 financial crisis produced an unparalleled level of regulation. New and complex requirements affect a wide range of issues from capital and liquidity requirements to offshore investments and tax and income transparency.</p><h3> <strong>  Changing Consumer Behavior </strong></h3><p> <br/> The aftermath of that crisis caused a paradigm shift in clients&rsquo; views of the financial services industry. Investors in all demographics are becoming more pragmatic and are searching for knowledge, credibility and visibility into their portfolios.</p><p> This is especially true among the Gen Y or &ldquo;Millennials&rdquo; segment, the generation coming of age in the 2000s. The largest age cohort since the Baby Boomers, it is being aggressively solicited by many large financial services providers as well as robo firms. Though they are more financially literate than older investors &mdash; and connected to news, information and each other to an unprecedented degree &mdash; they are also the most cynical when it comes to financial advice. As demographers and market historians point out: they were children when the NASDAQ bubble burst in 1990 and most were in college for the 2008 explosion as they watched their parents&rsquo; investments fall at a speed the industry had never seen. 5</p><p> Consumers&rsquo; daily experience online also contributes mightily to the impact on the wealth management profession. Google, Amazon, Facebook, et al, fuel client expectations of instant connection, selection and gratification, any time, any place, via any device. And social media enables anyone to share their investing experience (including their advisor&rsquo;s performance) with peers.</p><h3> <strong>  The Acceleration of Technology </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another key factor is the quest for artificial intelligence or AI, the intelligence of machines that is fueling disruptive change across several industries. At present, there is said to be more than 143 firms working in artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley alone.</p><p> In 1997, the IBM computer Deep Blue bested world chess champion Gary Kasparov using what is today thought of as rather &ldquo;simple&rdquo; if-this-then-that programming. In 2011, IBM&rsquo;s &ldquo;cognitive computer&rdquo; named Watson, competed against the two all-time top winning &ldquo;Jeopardy!&rdquo; competitors &mdash; and won. That required the computer to understand the game&rsquo;s answers, which are posed in natural language, search its massive database to find (or actually more accurately, build) the correct response, format it as a question to comply with game rules, and do it in record time to beat the other contestants to the buzzer. The machine&rsquo;s performance displayed a level of artificial intelligence scientists had been trying to achieve for years. 6</p><p> Forms of such AI at work &mdash;&ldquo;robo&rdquo; services, if you will &mdash; are everywhere, some more transparent than others. Can it be any surprise that AI is now at work in investment management?</p><h3> <strong>  Could the Human Voice Be Replicated? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Can consumers actually suspend their disbelief and accept computer-generated content as easily as they would human responses? The answer is, they do it every day but may not realize it.</p><p> Automated content generation is becoming the norm on the Web, on newswires, in newspapers, books and even on Wall Street. Sophisticated algorithms and natural language generators are behind a stunning number of news reports and articles published every day to audiences who admit they cannot tell the difference between &ldquo;robo journalism&rdquo; and content composed by humans. An example from two sports reports:</p><p> &ldquo;Things looked bleak for the Angels when they trailed by two runs in the ninth inning, but Los Angeles recovered thanks to a key single from Vladimir Guerrero to pull out a 7&ndash;6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;The University of Michigan baseball team used a four-run fifth inning to salvage the final game in its three-game weekend series with Iowa, winning 7&ndash;5 on Saturday afternoon (April 24) at the Wilpon Baseball Complex, home of historic Ray Fisher Stadium.&rdquo;</p><p> Which is which? The first was generated by machine, the second by a human. 7 The Associated Press uses a platform called Wordsmith to &ldquo;write&rdquo; more than 3,000 financial reports per quarter. The Los Angeles Times uses Quakebot to analyze geological data and Homicide Report for murder reporting, and Quill from Narrative Science is now generating financial reports for T. Rowe Price and USAA, among others. Even the CIA uses bot content generators. 8</p><p> The software gets better every year. Quill can actually take direction to &ldquo;angle&rdquo; a story for certain audiences, such as softening the blow of a loss by a beloved sports team for its fans. 9  Kristian Hammond of Narrative Science estimates that 90% of news could be generated by robot journalists by 2020. 10</p><p> The &ldquo;content&rdquo; that online robo advisors deliver via algorithms happens to be portfolio designs, currently based on rather straightforward suitability questionnaires. Given rapid development in AI, however, how long before they are able to respond to behavioral nuances of their clients &mdash; just like a human?</p><h3> <strong>  The New Competitive Landscape </strong></h3><p> <br/> While the major full-line brokerage houses continue to invest heavily in enhancing their web presence and level of interactivity to attract and retain clients, the new, do-it-yourself robo business models are gaining traction among retail investors. These disruptive entrants are appealing to certain investor demographics and psychographics by delivering investing experiences that meet the information and service expectations of many &ldquo;new age&rdquo; consumers.</p><p> The race to leverage new technology and capitalize on changing consumer sentiment is opening doors for very well-funded nontraditional startups to infringe on a once very exclusive club. This is different than the online trading environment in the 1990s because:</p><li> Regardless of age, more people are comfortable with internet bill pay, research and access to information that informs their purchases; and</li><li> People tend to trust the Internet above a human being. There is a belief among many investors that algorithms don&rsquo;t lie and are unbiased. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The Investment Industry Response </strong></h3><p> <br/> The industry response to all these environmental forces is nearly uniform.</p><li> A trend to using big data to define market segments (e.g., level of risk tolerance, wealth measures, life stage)</li><li> Increased investment in web presence and level of interactivity, not only to engage client and prospects but also to meet new regulatory requirements in a cost-efficient manner</li><li> Close examination/reevaluation of service offerings and pricing</li><li> Heavy focus on operational efficiency to protect margins from erosion</li><li> Full-service firms reiterating the value of human advice <br/>  </li><p> The implications for investment advisory point to downward pressure on margins and a dramatic alteration in business as usual. The question becomes whether you need to buy robo advisory services for your clients, and if not, how you immunize your practice against the perceived competition. Following are several key best practices for consideration.</p><h3> <strong>  What Can You Do To Protect and Grow Your Firm </strong></h3><p> <br/> Successfully competing in today&rsquo;s investing environment will demand:</p><li> An understanding of the power of branding in professional services and development of the marketing tools necessary to build and support your brand;</li><li> Commitment to increased scalability through use of increasingly sophisticated technology;</li><li> Multichannel delivery systems with a multigenerational and multitalented advisory team to straddle the growing age range and preferences of profitable investors; and</li><li> Building unique portfolios differentiated from those available at robo advisory firms.</li><h3> <br/> <strong>  Your Brand is Your Promise &mdash; Build it and Promote it </strong></h3><p> <br/> First, reevaluate who you are today, what you want to become tomorrow and where you fit &mdash; or aspire to fit &mdash; in the range of advisory service models. As Exhibit 2 illustrates, the more comprehensive and customized your offerings, the better your opportunity to truly differentiate yourself in an increasingly competitive world.</p><p> Please click <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-rise-of-robo-advisory-post-40416\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> to read the full white paper.</p><p> ___________________________</p>1 The Race to Easy: Reevaluating the Wealth Management Technology Strategy.

    "content": "<h3> It is the long history of humankind that those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed. &mdash;Charles Darwin</h3><p> <br/> Effective collaboration is at the core of successful business partnerships, but it is a balancing act. Collaboration can result in better products and services but can also be time-consuming and negatively affect profitability. We recently completed a survey of over 130 business partners, looking for trends in how they collaborate to create satisfying, and profitable, partnerships. In reviewing the results, one of the issues we looked at was whether there were differences in how the gender mix of the partnership affected satisfaction among partners.</p><h3> Men and women collaborate for greater profitability; less satisfaction</h3><p> <br/> In our study, those in mixed-gender partnerships were the most satisfied with the monetary success of their firms (91% monetary satisfaction rate) followed closely by those in the all-male partnerships (87%), with all-female partnerships lagging significantly. Just 62% of those in partnerships comprised of women were satisfied with the monetary success of their business.</p><p> But the monetary success of mixed-gender partnerships may come at a cost. When we look at satisfaction with partners, the results were reversed: mixed-gender groups were least satisfied with their partners. About two-thirds said that they would choose all of the same partners again vs. almost 91% of all-female partnerships.  Seventy percent of all-male partners said they would choose the same partners again.</p><p> These results support academic research about gender in work teams, generally:  that gender diversity is good for profitability, but not-so-great for overall satisfaction. A 2014 study on gender-diverse work teams by MIT and George Washington University found greater satisfaction among those working on same-gender teams, but that mixed-gender teams were more productive.  In fact, this study estimated that mixed- gender teams can add 41% in additional revenue.   The authors theorized that those on same-gender teams were more satisfied because they were more likely to socialize with those they work with, but that this led to lower productivity.</p><h3> Profitability is not what drives partner satisfaction, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the business itself, the work you do&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Across all partnerships in our study, though, profitability is not the strongest driver of satisfaction.  Most (52%) considered &ldquo;the business itself, the work you do&rdquo; to be of primary importance.  This may be why, though profitability is highest among mixed-gender groups, satisfaction is lowest. It may also be that mixed-gender partnerships are generally larger groups of partners.  There may be other elements of control and communication that are lost in bigger partnerships that also lead to lower satisfaction rates.</p><p> For all-female partnerships it may not be a matter of socializing, but collaboration, that leads to lower financial satisfaction. Academic research indicates that women tend to have a more collaborative style.  It may be that those in all-female firms gain satisfaction from the quality of their work, which is achieved through strong collaboration among partners, but this approach can be less profitable.</p><p> As in most studies of trends, what is most important is what the tradeoffs might mean for achieving the financial and personal success in your own partnership.  Awareness of these issues can help set expectations that allow you to maximize the benefits, and minimize the challenges, of your partnership.</p><p> Adapted from The Partnership Resource <u>  <a href=\"/category/workforce/partnerships\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2015 Survey Results and Analysis  </a> </u></p>",

    "content": "<h3> Life is chaotic, fast-paced, and overwhelming.</h3>You feel exhausted, busy yet not productive, and it&rsquo;s causing you to disengage. Does any of this describe you or your team? If so, keep reading!Today&rsquo;s culture of work is no easy feat. With all the responsibilities, decisions to be made, people asking for direction and guidance, and the quality and quantity of work required; it can become so overwhelming you simply don&rsquo;t want to do it anymore and disengage completely because you have lost control.<h3> Watch for Warning Signs</h3>I&rsquo;ve watched this happen to some of my peers and not all had a positive turnaround.Well, little did I know, my turn for this experience was coming in late 2015. I&rsquo;d grown my business to a tremendously successful level, yet the passion I once had was flagging. My level of engagement was dipping as I went through the motions of work, and it started adversely affecting my personal life, my health, and my team.In fact, I was disengaged to the point of considering going back into the corporate workforce versus running a business and giving up everything I worked so hard to achieve. That&rsquo;s when I knew something had to give.Putting myself first was not something that was top of mind, yet it was the exact prescription that was the solution to my challenge. I had to practice what I preached to so many business owners, advisors, and team members. That was my &ldquo;A-ha!&rdquo; moment, a positive turning point that&rsquo;s paid major dividends ever since.<h3> The Big Question:</h3>When was the last time you gave yourself permission for breathing room to collect your thoughts and reenergize yourself?  Life is so much better now that I have given myself that breathing room!Here is your roadmap of 10 steps to enhance your quality of life and take control:<strong> 1. Purposefully disengage</strong><li> Be okay with saying NO without explaining yourself</li><li> You don&rsquo;t have to attend every conference that is available</li><li> Unsubscribe frequently</li><strong> 2. One internally focused day per week</strong><li> Your business can&rsquo;t evolve if you don&rsquo;t focus on how it is working or not working</li><li> Be better for your clients by focusing on how you run your business</li><strong> 3. Turn off your sound on your computer to avoid the dings and pings</strong><li> These are unnecessary distractions and will break your focus</li><li> Email will always be waiting for you, so be strategic about when you check it</li><li> Turn off app notifications &ndash; do you really need to know who posted what on Facebook?</li><strong> 4. Wrapping up at 5 pm</strong><li> Working longer doesn&rsquo;t mean you are more productive, it just means you are working longer</li><strong> 5. 10k a day minimum</strong><li> Break it down &ndash; 1,000 steps every hour &ndash; this will clear the fog throughout the day</li><strong> 6. Unplug</strong><li> Take a 1-hour minimum break from all electronics during the day</li><img alt=\"Profile of a beautiful woman relaxing lying on a couch at home\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/far-east-hospitality-oasia.jpg \"/><strong> 7. Eat more frequently</strong><li> Don&rsquo;t go without breakfast as this is the kick start to your day</li><li> Smoothies are your friend and they&rsquo;re quick and easy</li><li> 2 snacks between breakfast, lunch and dinner</li><li> Protein at every meal</li><strong> 8. Exercise 5 minutes a day to create consistency</strong><li> Create small targets you can&rsquo;t possibly miss, you can always do more</li><li> The gym is not always the answer</li><li> Amazing how much your body starts to change and it is NOT a mental challenge to get it done</li><strong> 9. Take a nap &ndash; sleep your way to the top! </strong><li> The National Sleep Foundation recommends a short nap of 30 to 40 minutes for &ldquo;improved alertness and performance&rdquo;</li><li> <a href=\"http://michaelhyatt.com/why-you-should-take-a-nap-every-day.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Naps help avoid burnout </a>  and make you more productive without interrupting your nighttime sleep</li><li> When fatigue sets in, a nap allows you to manage your overall energy, mental, and physical stamina</li><strong> 10. No electronics 1 hour prior to bed</strong><li> The blue light has been shown to keep you awake close to bedtime</li><li> Consider tinted safety glasses in the evening to block out blue light from devices</li><li> Uvex UV Extreme is my preference and so attractive to wear</li><img alt=\"uvex\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/category/grow/development\"/><h3> Conclusion: Give Yourself the Space to Breathe&hellip;</h3>Give yourself breathing room to think, create, develop, and plan out your strategy both personally and professionally. Do not wait until you are burnt out to change your path. Decide to take control of your life and make good choices today.Every journey begins with a single step&hellip;and hopefully a good night&rsquo;s sleep!",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/danielle-stitt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Danielle Stitt  </u> </a></p><h3> If a blank screen fills you with dread, use our handy 15-step template to give your financial services blog posts punch, consistency and even a little SEO juice. <br/>  </h3><p> Blogs can be extremely useful financial services marketing tools. In offering genuinely helpful information, it helps your brand stand out from the crowd. This is good for the reader AND it&rsquo;s good for you: driving suspects along the buyer journey to become customers and ultimately, even evangelists.</p><p> But with the internet awash with content, there&rsquo;s no room for a ho-hum blog&hellip; well there probably is room but it&rsquo;s on page 156 of the search engine results where no-one will ever read it. And like the philosophical question &ldquo;If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&rdquo;, you have to ask yourself &ldquo;If my blog appears beyond page 1 on Google and no-one reads it, does it really matter that I wrote it?&rdquo;.</p><p> Existentialism aside, how do you get your ideal customer to read it? The answer is to produce content that&rsquo;s worth reading. Of course you need to optimise it, distribute it, use your influencers&rsquo; reach to amplify it and a bunch of other activities that&rsquo;ll keep you at your desk into the wee hours, but we are going to focus here on helping you create a vast forest (perhaps even one that is visible from space!), one beautiful tree at a time.</p><h3> Enter the ultimate financial services blog template. <br/>  </h3><p> This is your new best friend. It means you no longer need to start with that scary blank screen and it lets you focus on your message, all within a consistent framework.</p><h3> Step 1: Identify your target audience and where they are in the Buyer Journey <br/>  </h3><p> Which of your buyer personas are you writing this blog post for and at what stage of the buyer journey are they? We cannot emphasise enough the importance of having your ideal reader in mind before you put finger to keyboard. Think about who they are, what they want to achieve or avoid and what information they need (and you want to provide) right now. Remember we discussed  <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/mapping-your-content-to-the-buyers-journey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mapping your content to the buyer&rsquo;s journey </a> .</p><h3> Step 2: Decide what one thing you want your reader to know <br/>  </h3><p> If, after reading your blog, someone asked your persona what the article was about, what one message would you want them to relay back to you? This is your key takeaway. Every great blog needs a key takeaway because that&rsquo;s what makes it worth your persona&rsquo;s time to read it.</p><h3> Step 3: Create a short list of a few possible titles <br/>  </h3><p> The first title you choose probably won&rsquo;t be the final title you publish. At least start with a working title that gives your blog post direction and unity. If nothing else, it&rsquo;ll stop your writing rambling off course.</p><p> Once your post is written, revisit your list of possible titles to find the one that accurately reflects the blog post&rsquo;s content, is intriguing enough to motivate your persona to want to read more and is optimised for search i.e. has your target keyword(s) in it.</p><h3> Step 4: Use a framework to logically structure your post <br/>  </h3><p> The typical blog post consists of:</p><li> An introduction: Describes the pain or aspiration your target reader is experiencing and promises them a solution</li><li> A body: Steps them through the solution(s) providing information that teaches them something new or gives them a framework for thinking through the solution for themselves</li><li> A conclusion: Summarises the post with a brief statement that wraps up what your readers just learned</li><h3> Step 5: Frame the problem in your introduction <br/>  </h3><p> The introduction tells your persona that you understand their problem or desire and you are the right person to help them with it. The sole purpose of the introduction is to set stage for the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of your post thereby motivating your persona to keep reading. Write a lousy introduction and you risk losing your persona&rsquo;s interest as they click away to something more compelling (crazy cat video anyone?).</p><p> And just because your introduction appears first doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to write it first. Often you&rsquo;ll find it easier to write this section last.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown on a killer intro:</p><li> Write a compelling opening sentence that introduces your personas problem or objective</li><li> Explain the problem or objective in a little more detail</li><li> Provide a transition that moves from the pain/need to an overview of the solution</li><h3> Step 6: Provide the solution in your blog&rsquo;s main body <br/>  </h3><p> This is where you deliver value to your persona. You need to follow through on your promise to provide a solution and ensure that you do so in an easy to understand way, which may be challenging in the financial services industry. Visuals are a great way to make complex information more digestible and lists can help you be concise. In fact, use whatever mix of paragraphs, bullet points, images, graphs etc you feel your persona will appreciate.</p><p> When your target audience does not consist of subject matter experts, another good way to explain complex concepts and make them interesting is to use relatable analogies. This helps to connect something completely unfamiliar to the individual and make it relevant. For example, a problem starting to face insurance companies is that a good majority of millennials, being young and healthy, see life insurance as an unnecessary expense. In this case an analogy the company could use is: &ldquo;Getting life insurance is like waiting to clean your room &ndash; the longer you wait to start, the bigger the burden becomes.&rdquo;</p><p> Don&rsquo;t worry too much about word count. Yes, your blog post should be more than 300 words from an SEO perspective (and really, how deeply can you cover a topic in less than that?) but rather than sticking to a minimum word count, stay focused on providing information that your persona needs and can action in some way.</p><h3> Step 7: Put it into perspective in your conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> The conclusion is where you summarise what your persona has learnt. You can spell out for them how they&rsquo;ve benefited from reading the blog and ask them a question that invites them to respond to you or challenges their own thinking. Are you up for the feedback? (See what I did there? No need to answer, I was just showing you what a concluding question could look like!)</p><h3> Step 8: Hyperlink to other useful information <br/>  </h3><p> While you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about word count, it isn&rsquo;t practical or very reader-friendly to cover in detail everything you mention in your blog post. This is where hyperlinking to other resources can be helpful for those readers that want to dig further into a particular topic.</p><p> It also shows your persona that you&rsquo;re across the topic. By referencing other content you demonstrate you&rsquo;re widely read on the subject and therefore a subject matter expert.</p><p> Second, linking to other content on your website helps position your brand as source of information on related topics; perhaps even a first-stop for when your persona needs help. It also helps cross-promote your content, giving it a greater chance of being read more widely.</p><p> Finally, outbound hyperlinks i.e. links to websites beyond your own, help with your search engine rankings. While inbound links i.e. links from other websites to yours are most valuable, outbound links also provide cues to Google that you&rsquo;re an authority on your subject and therefore worth bumping up the search results.</p><h3> Step 9: Finalise your title <br/>  </h3><p> Now that the post is written, you can decide what title best describes its content. You&rsquo;ll need to find a balance between descriptiveness, SEO-friendliness and Buzzfeed style click-bait. I like to use the free tool  <a href=\"http://www.aminstitute.com/headline/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Emotional Value Marketing Headline Analyser </a>  or  <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Coschedule&rsquo;s Headline Analyzer </a>  to test some headlines for their likelihood of driving a human to click through on a blog post. It&rsquo;s not a silver bullet but it does help choose words with greater impact to include in a title.</p><h3> Step 10: Always include a Call-to-Action <br/>  </h3><p> Alec Baldwin&rsquo;s character in the movie &ldquo;Glengarry Glen Ross&rdquo; taught his sales people ABC &ndash; Always Be Closing. While I&rsquo;m not advocating the hard sell at the end of all your blog posts, I am encouraging you to think about what you want your persona to do next. It could be as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; as to read more of your content or interact with your brand via the comment box. At the other end of the spectrum and if the persona is closer to wanting to make a purchase decision, you could ask them to leave their contact details for one of your client services team can follow up. This comes back to Step 1 where you decided who you were writing for and where they were at.  </p><h3> Step 11: Edit <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s very difficult to edit your own work. Ideally have someone in your team take the role of editor. A good editor will help the brand&rsquo;s voice stay true without washing out the uniqueness of each author&rsquo;s style.</p><p> A second pair of eyes will also help with simple hygiene issues like typos, grammatical errors and gaps in logic. It&rsquo;s just part of good quality assurance.</p><h3> Step 12: Get visual <br/>  </h3><p> As humans we are driven by visuals. Try to include at least one photo or image in every post, first so it&rsquo;s more interesting for your reader but also so that when the blog post is published in social media channels, it includes a thumbnail image to entice a clickthrough.</p><p> There are plenty of royalty-free images to choose from if you don&rsquo;t have a corporate image library already. In Google click on Images &gt; More Tools &gt; Usage Rights to filter for images that can be used commercially. We also like stock image libraries like iStockPhoto and Shutterstock which have inexpensive options.</p><h3> Step 13: Optimise your post for search <br/>  </h3><p> We asked at the beginning whether it&rsquo;s even worth writing a blog if no one reads it so don&rsquo;t run the risk of no one reading it! Search engine optimisation (SEO) is a giant, ever changing topic all to itself so we won&rsquo;t tackle it here. What is worth mentioning is having a couple of keywords you&rsquo;re targeting in mind when writing your blogs and including them as you write (or edit). If you&rsquo;d like a blog template from an SEO perspective, then we are happy to share the one we developed for ourselves. Just email  <a href=\"mailto:askus@bluechipcommunication.com.au\">  askus@bluechipcommunication.com.au </a>  and we'll send it to you.</p><h3> Step 14: Publish and promote <br/>  </h3><p> Of course publish your post on your website (or wherever your blog lives) but don&rsquo;t stop there. We are big fans of spending as much, if not more, time on promoting your content as you did on creating it. Think about all the places you can promote your blog post, including your social media channels, tapping influencers both online and offline, revisiting old content to update with links to the new content if appropriate, boosting with paid spend, inclusion in email signatures, encouraging staff to share with their networks and the list goes on. Develop a checklist of promotion activities you can run through every time you publish.</p><h3> Step 15: Measure and improve <br/>  </h3><p> Make sure measuring and reporting the performance of your posts becomes part of your blogging rhythm. Visitor numbers are one metric to track but perhaps more interestingly you can track engagement, length of time on the page and clicks on the call to actions to get a sense of how interested your persona is in the topic.</p><p> This is great information for informing your content ideation and ensuring you are creating content your persona is interested in.</p><p> Most importantly, it will mean someone will be listening when that tree falls in the forest.</p>",

When teams come together, truly working together, sharing their skills and passion, in pursuit of a shared objective their collective energy creates results far beyond the ability of individuals working separately.</p><p> As leaders, it is our responsibility to get our ego, pride, and hidden agendas out of the way so that we can build and inspire our team to create good, collective energy.</p><p> So, once you&rsquo;ve set aside your behaviors that inhibit collective energy, how can you then tap into this energy in your team?</p><h3> Feed their passion <br/>  </h3><p> We all want to find meaning in our work, to make a valuable contribution to something important. People find energy in their passions, this energy is compounded when you identify and feed the passion of your team. Give them something to believe in; something worth collaborating for, something worth giving their all for and you will tap into the collective energy of your team.</p><h3> Tap into their experience <br/>  </h3><p> Everyone has something unique to offer. People want to be challenged and given the opportunity to use their specific skills and knowledge to meet the demands of those challenges. When you tap into the experience of individual team members while bringing them together in pursuit of a shared goal, you are tapping into the collective energy of your team.</p><h3> Show them respect <br/>  </h3><p> What do your employees desire more than anything else? They want to be valued and respected. When you show respect for your employees, you show them that you have confidence in their abilities, that you value their contributions, and that you trust their judgment. If you want to tap into the collective energy of your teams, you must show them respect on both and individual and a team level.</p><h3> Share the leadership <br/>  </h3><p> A team is not a hierarchical machine; it is a living organism where roles and leadership are in a constant state of flux. An employee with a great attitude might serve best as the leader when the team becomes frustrated. Other employees may lead at different times based on the requirements of the current task. Another employee might have the organization and planning skills necessary to lead the initial planning process. You will tap into the collective energy of your team when you allow leaders to emerge naturally when their strengths meet the immediate needs of the team.</p><h3> Tap into Your Team&rsquo;s Collective Energy <br/>  </h3><p> As a leader, it is your responsibility to make sure your team is working well together. The most successful leaders tap into the collective energy of their teams and create environments where everyone feels engaged and valued.</p><p> Each team member is an expert in something; they each serve an important purpose. Feed their passion. Tap into their experience. Show them respect. And, share the leadership. When a team brings their collective energy together and focuses on a shared objective, the results of the team will by far surpass the potential of each individual working alone.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> No one wants to dwell on a topic like their own demise, but it is one that needs to be discussed as part of your overall financial plan.</p><p> How do you want your assets divided when you pass on?</p><p> It&rsquo;s a complicated issue, and one that you will need to think about carefully.</p><p> The worst thing you can do is put off dealing with this issue because it makes you uncomfortable.</p><p> Talk to your financial advisor, get some legal advice, and avoid these common mistakes that far too many people make when it comes to updating your estate plan.</p><h3> Mistakes to Avoid When Updating your Estate Plan <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Failing to Make a Legal Will <br/>  </h3><p> What happens if you die without a valid will in British Columbia? As of March 31, 2014, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/09013_01#part3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Wills, Estates and Succession Act  </a> </u>  determines how your estate will be divided.</p><p> Your spouse would be entitled to $300,000.00 from your estate. He or she would also be entitled to the household furnishings and half of the residue of the estate &mdash; regardless of the number of children you have. <br/> The law does not guarantee a surviving spouse the right to remain in the matrimonial home after you pass away. Your surviving spouse does have the option of using the $300,000 he or she is guaranteed to receive to buy the matrimonial home from the estate. (If you own your matrimonial home as joint tenants, this provision does not apply.)</p><p> The legislation also deals with the situation of people who die without a will and who have children from a previous marriage. In this instance, your current spouse&rsquo;s entitlement is cut in half to only $150,000.00. The balance of the estate is divided in half, with one portion going to your spouse and the other one being split among your children, regardless of which marriage they were born from.</p><h3> 2. Neglecting to Update your Will <br/>  </h3><p> Your will should be updated as circumstances in your life change. If you get divorced, you will probably want to make a new will (unless you want your former spouse to inherit a portion of your estate). You will also want to write a new one if you decide to remarry.</p><p> Other situations where you will need to update your will would be if one of the beneficiaries dies or if you sell an asset that you mention in it. If you acquire a major asset, you&rsquo;ll likely want to update your will to provide instructions for it on when you pass on. You may also change your mind about how you want your estate divided, and this will mean consulting a lawyer to make changes to your will.</p><p> Once you update your will, consider registering a  <u>  wills notice </u>  with the Vital Statistics Agency. You would pay a small fee to register a document stating that you have made a will and where it is kept. The Agency does not keep a copy of your will or have access to any of its contents. Your next of kin would be able to search the Wills Registry to make sure that they have the latest version of your will after you pass on.</p><h3> 3. Writing your Will on your Own <br/>  </h3><p> Going the DIY route is not the best choice when making your will. You may miss out on some important details that can make a big difference to your estate, such as failing to include all of your assets or using incorrect wording. This is a situation where you really need to consult with an attorney.</p>",

    "content": "<p> David brought up an interesting point this week. While polite, reasonable, and respectful behavior (definition compliments of merriam-webster.com) is not typically the topic of conversation in financial circles, I submit that it should be. Whether &ldquo;we&rdquo; are in business, finance or government, &ldquo;we&rdquo; are people and people get things done by first building relationships with other people. Without civility, relationship building is impossible and the result of that, sadly, is being played out before our eyes in real time.</p><p> Thank you, David, for your words and example. Even over the years when you and I have disagreed, our mutual respect and behavior in a polite and reasonable manner had led to the building of a very enjoyable relationship.</p><p> David&rsquo;s views are his own. But my guess is that all of us are somewhat frustrated with the political drama regardless what &ldquo;side of the aisle&rdquo; we are on. I&rsquo;m sharing to emphasize the importance of looking beyond what we see on the surface or read in the headlines to ensure that what we are gleaning is reflective of what the speaker truly conveyed, instead of a version of what someone else wanted us to hear. </p><p> <strong>  Perception, after all, is equally or perhaps even more important than reality. </strong></p><p> As you read through, keep our &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask&rdquo; motto in mind. If you have a question for David or any of our 20+ expert instructors just <u>  <a href=\"mailto:ask@fixedincomeacademy.com\">   ask@fixedincomeacademy.com  </a> </u> .</p><h3> <strong>  A Note on Civility </strong></h3><p> <br/> By <u>  David Horner </u> , Ph.D., Chief Economist, Fixed Income Academy</p><p> Note the difference between the mud slinging that is characterizing two of the Republican candidate&rsquo;s campaigns and the demeanor of Fed officials debating monetary policy.</p><p> Worse than the controversy surrounding the childish &ldquo;food-fight&rdquo; between Trump and Cruz&rsquo;s over their wives is the most recent &ldquo;dirty trick&rdquo; associated with the Republican establishment. The desperation of less right-wing Republicans such as Jeb Bush has now spread to the legal arena. As I view the video associated with the charge against Trump&rsquo;s campaign manager, this is an attempt of &ldquo;anti-Trumpers&rdquo; to further derail the Trump campaign, nothing more. Indeed, Trump&rsquo;s secret service guard was so concerned about the reporter filing the suit that they too were trying to prevent the reporter from &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; Trump. Although I am not a Trump supporter, it is clear that the mainstream of the Republican Party has been co-opted by a group of corrupt operatives.</p><p> In contrast, consider the policy debate over monetary policy between the hawks and doves. When Charles Evans, perhaps the most dovish FOMC member, defends his position, he always shows respect for the hawks who disagree with him. Moreover, he weighs the pros and cons and, unlike lawyers and politicians whose &ldquo;job&rdquo; is to present only one side of the equation in order to boost their client or candidate&rsquo;s chances, he admits the factors that do not support his position. Hawks likewise are every bit as civil, both sides trying to debate and determine what policy is best for the country. </p><p> Frankly, the media has, in many cases made the situation worse rather than better. They seem to want to promote a fight. Several commentators interpreted Yellen&rsquo;s recent speech as a &ldquo;smack-down&rdquo; of the hawks. This is simply not true. Rather, she made her case forcefully. And, as indicated in the Fed section below, much of what she said clearly went over the heads of the media pundits. But her words were not lost on the Fund managers and financial economists that I respect. Hence the positive market response to her speech.</p><h3> <strong>  Monetary policy and the Fed  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Chair Yellen&rsquo;s speech before the Economic Club of New York reiterated the points made in her March 16 press conference following the most recent FOMC meeting. However her talk, made in the presence of economists and business leaders was more detailed and supported by a number of research and clarification footnotes. On balance, investors took the speech as being even more bullish than the press conference.</p><p> Although gratified by the economic recovery, Yellen&rsquo;s main theme was that a premature hike in policy rates is the most dangerous policy mistake that the Fed could make and Yellen is very clear on this! As I have written a number of times, the best way to get nominal rates up to a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; rate in the longer run is to keep policy rates &ldquo;too low&rdquo; in the short term. Moreover, as Yellen also points out, although it seems lost on the CNBC commentators, when rates are already near zero, the danger of raising rates prematurely swamps the danger or getting behind the curve (the footnotes in her speech to the economic clubs documents the research in this regard). Extraordinary measures are needed to get the economy out of a recession if policy rates are zero. Conversely, the measures needed to get inflation under control are straightforward and well understood.</p><p> Another error I hear over and over from smart but seemingly deaf commentators, is that the Fed keeps telling us the economy is in &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; shape. Are they not reading or listening to Fed officials? They constantly cite that the economy is on a slow, but positive track. They underscore the robust job increases and low inflation that has characterized the recovery (these are their mandates). Yes they acknowledge that growth is slower than they would like, productivity is weak and wages are not increasing as fast as they would like. But they have little to no control over these factors which are affected by fiscal and tax policy and by regulation. So the Fed is not saying the economy is in terrible shape. Rather they are saying that a policy mistake at this point, most notably, hiking policy rates too quickly, could put the economy into a slide and this is the worst possible outcome. It is better &ldquo;goose&rdquo; the economy and to accept a higher than optimal rate of inflation to that market rates rise to a point where they once again can serve the normal function of allocating capital efficiently. </p><p> Having made the case for and agreed with Yellen&rsquo;s cautious and gradual policy, I still think the Fed will raise rates at the June, September, and December meetings, one more hike than the recent median of FOMC members expectations and one less than their expectations at the end of the year. </p><p> My reasoning is straightforward. I think that:</p><li> Given recent aggressive policy moves and coordination by G20 countries, the world economy will gradually move to a better footing than the most recent IMF downgrade (see my political note at the end of the report),</li><li> Following the yearend slowdown, the U.S. economic growth is beginning to improve,</li><li> Inflation will be higher than the current Fed forecast. </li><p> In other words, the Fed will raise rates for optimistic economic reasons</p><p> Whether you agree or disagree, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you. Cheers!</p>",

    "content": "<p> The other day a client called me for advice about an important sale he was involved with. His firm was making its final presentation that very week. I did my best, but the problem was that he and his team had made some important mistakes much earlier in the business development process. It was now too late to rectify them.</p><h3> Their position was weak. They were lost in a strange city because they had made several wrong turns earlier in the trip.</h3><p> <br/> I see very basic but often fatal mistakes made all the time during the sales process&ndash;frequently by very sophisticated professionals. I&rsquo;ve personally made more than my share of them during my career. Here are the 12 most common ones:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Not preparing </strong></h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;d be surprised how many client executives have complained to me about the poorly prepared people who come to pitch them on their services. My father always told me, &ldquo;There is no substitute for genuine lack of preparation.&rdquo; Well, it&rsquo;s true. Research the individual you&rsquo;re meeting with as well as their company. Establish the agenda in advance&mdash;find out if there&rsquo;s something in particular they are interested in. Make sure you know who will actually attend your meeting. Don&rsquo;t walk in and ask, &ldquo;So tell me about your business&rdquo; (yes, really, people use this as an opener&hellip;it&rsquo;s probably the last time they ever see the prospect&hellip;)</p><h3> <strong>  2. Not walking in as a peer </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many potential engagements are lost in the first ten seconds because the presumptive advisor or service provider doesn&rsquo;t walk in and act like a peer. Acting like a peer has a mental and a physical side to it. Mentally, you must believe you belong in that senior executive&rsquo;s office. You must be fully convinced you have something very, very valuable to offer. Physically, you have to stand tall and exude confidence. But you also have to show you&rsquo;re humble though your tone and your curiosity.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Trying to accomplish too much in the first meeting </strong></h3><p> <br/> In a very first meeting, you must focus on a limited number of objectives. You need to focus on:</p><li> Building rapport and trust</li><li> Establishing (indirectly, through questions and client examples) your credibility</li><li> Understanding the client&rsquo;s most pressing issues&mdash;their agenda</li><li> Creating enough interest to invite another meeting <br/>  </li><p> In most first meetings you are NOT trying to &ldquo;be sure to mention products X, Y, and Z&rdquo; or &ldquo;Discuss our newly opened Singapore office.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re NOT trying to get commitment to a project or deal. You&rsquo;re NOT trying to simultaneously talk in detail about the project you&rsquo;re doing at a lower level in the organization while making a pitch to reorganize the entire company. And so on&mdash;you get the idea. Don&rsquo;t load that first conversation down with too much or it will sink to the bottom very quickly.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Rushing the sale </strong></h3><p> <br/> As Diana Ross and the Supremes sang, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hurry love.&rdquo; If you try and rush the sale you&rsquo;ll come across as &ldquo;salesy&rdquo; and unsophisticated. Some sales can happen in one meeting; others take ten meetings. But in all cases you have to get the foundations in place. Is there an urgent issue and have you understood it 360 degrees? Have you built trust in your ability to address the issue with a road-tested approach? Are the internal stakeholders lined up? Etc. For any kind of a sophisticated and complex product or service, if there&rsquo;s no trusting relationship, there&rsquo;s no sale. Real professionals actively manage the selling process, always pushing it&mdash;artfully&mdash;to the next step. But they are patient. As Abraham Lincoln said, &ldquo;If I have six hours to chop down a tree, I spend four hours sharpening my axe.&rdquo; Everyone talks about &ldquo;closing the sale&rdquo; but that will never happen if you haven&rsquo;t put in the careful, hard work in the days and weeks leading up to the close.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Focusing on your solution not the client need </strong></h3><p> <br/> When you have the expert-for-hire mindset, you focus on your methodology or solution and how great it is for the client. In contrast, when you have the advisor mindset you focus on developing a deep, full understanding of the client and their needs. Don&rsquo;t be a product-pusher. Explore your client&rsquo;s agenda carefully, testing for frustrations and also aspirations. When you lead with your marvelous solution&ndash;your &ldquo;unique approach&rdquo;&ndash; it&rsquo;s a turnoff. First show you&rsquo;ve really understood what the client is looking for. Then and only then illustrate how what you do could help address their need.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Using PowerPoint or other written material </strong></h3><p> <br/> Why would you go through a presentation or brochure in a first meeting? You have no idea what the client is interested in at that point&mdash;or at least, even if you have an idea, you haven&rsquo;t explored it sufficiently to develop a PowerPoint deck on it. In the first meeting you want to have a conversation, not show the other person how much you know. You can&rsquo;t have a great conversation when your prospect is reading slides in front of you. You could bring a &ldquo;leave behind&rdquo; with some credentials and client examples&mdash;but you should leave this with the client as you depart. In a second or third meeting, a presentation might be more appropriate.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Not meeting with the decision maker&mdash;the buyer </strong></h3><p> <br/> Question: How can you sell something to someone you have never met? Answer: With great difficulty. Don&rsquo;t waste your time and invest in a long business development process if you can&rsquo;t meet or speak to the actual decision maker&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;economic buyer.&rdquo; Everyone and their brother will try and keep you from meeting with the executive sponsor for the program or issue in question. Your job is to stand tall and explain why you have to speak to that executive in order to fully understand the issue and craft a meaningful proposal.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Ignoring the emotional and political aspects of the sale </strong></h3><p> <br/> No one buys for purely rational reasons. Remember the old adage: Facts tell, emotions sell. Every major sale has emotional (or personal) dimensions to it and also political dimensions. How will your project or engagement affect the key executives? Who does it threaten? Who are the stakeholders who will be involved in the decision, and what is the rational and personal agenda of each of them? How will different constituencies be affected with the client&rsquo;s organization? Ignore the emotional and political dimensions, and you dramatically handicap yourself.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Not asking high-quality questions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Everyone knows they should ask really good questions. I find most professionals fall into two groups: Those who just talk nonstop and don&rsquo;t ask questions at all, and those who ask mediocre questions. Very few people ask truly thought-provoking, interesting questions. Here&rsquo;s an example of what I mean:</p><p> Issue: The client wants to reorganize around customer segments instead of geography.</p><li> Boring question: What&rsquo;s your timetable for implementation of the new organization?</li><li> Boring question: Can you tell me about the segments you want to organize around?</li><li> Better question: How would you characterize the distinct needs and goals of each of the three segments you&rsquo;ve identified? (and how will you organize internally to meet those needs?)</li><li> Better question: What motivated you to make this change, now?</li><li> Better question: How will the key executives in the current structure be impacted by this change? Typically, there is resistance to a move like this&mdash;where do you think the resistance will occur in your own organization? <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  10. Not listening </strong></h3><p> <br/> When it comes to serving clients, aside from outright incompetence, there&rsquo;s almost nothing worse than being considered someone who &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t listen very well.&rdquo; And few greater accolades than &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an excellent listener.&rdquo; Listening isn&rsquo;t about just asking questions and listening. It&rsquo;s about showing you really understood. Asking for clarification. Posing thoughtful follow-up questions. Affirming. Empathizing. And, disclosing and sharing your own experiences and thoughts. It&rsquo;s about making the other person feel like they were they ONLY person in your world for those 40 minutes you were together.</p><h3> <strong>  11. Playing not to lose and ending up bland and unmemorable </strong></h3><p> <br/> Especially when meeting with a senior executive, you can&rsquo;t play to not lose. You must play to win. If you take a conservative, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t offend anyone and don&rsquo;t upset the apple cart&rdquo; approach, you will seem bland and unmemorable. And then you will be&hellip;forgotten. You must walk in and clearly stand for something. You must have an incisive point of view about the prospect&rsquo;s industry or function. You should be willing to gently challenge them and their definition of the problem and the solution. Be bold, not bland.</p><h3> <strong>  12. Not adding enough value to command a second meeting </strong></h3><p> <br/> If your prospect doesn&rsquo;t derive value from the first meeting, why would they want to meet again? In the past, executives might take the time to get to know you if they think you eventually could have something to offer. But today&rsquo;s time pressed clients don&rsquo;t have that luxury. They need to think, &ldquo;This was a useful conversation. This person seems to know their stuff. Our discussion helped sharpen my understanding of my issues and the possible solutions that are out there. I have the feeling this is someone I could trust and have a relationship with.&rdquo; Add value through examples of what other clients have done, by sharing market and competitive information, by explaining best practices that may be helpful for the challenges the client has mentioned to you, by asking thought-provoking questions, by challenging their very definition of the problem, and so on.</p><p> Now, take the &ldquo;Not&rdquo; out of each sentence and you know exactly what you should do in your next business development conversation. Go for it.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> A few days ago, my schedule was so hectic I read an article I wrote last year called  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/21-not-so-secret-ways-to-slow-down-your-day/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  21 Not-So-Secret Ways to Slow Down Your Day </a> . <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before&mdash;I reread my articles when I need help because the world relentlessly attempts to wear you down.</p><p> Rereading my own stuff isn&rsquo;t nearly as ridiculous as how I fumble around looking for the articles! Sure, I remember my titles, but I can&rsquo;t always recall specific passages. You would belly laugh if I confessed the number of times each day I need to search my own site. LOL.</p><p> As I attempted to slow my day, I realized even the best time managers (really life managers) struggle when attempting to juggle too many items. I started thinking not about managing the time, but unloading or rethinking my approach. Out popped these nine powerful questions to immediately reduce stress.</p><p> I figured accomplishing great feats while being stressed out seems to miss the point completely. So, let&rsquo;s take a look at some questions you can ask yourself to help relieve your stress while you&rsquo;re on your way to accomplishing your dreams.</p><h3> What should I stop completely? <br/>  </h3><p> I call this addition by subtraction. There are some aspects of your life or activities  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/quit-bad-habits_n_4577016.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   you can (or should) do without  </a> </u> . Sometimes these are outings with people or work activities you can offload. Challenge yourself. You&rsquo;ll thank me. Take a peek at  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/mwblog/my-favorite-8-ways-to-politely-say-no/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   My Favorite 8 Ways to Politely Say No  </a> </u>  to get a running start.</p><h3> What can I postpone? <br/>  </h3><p> There are very few &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; in life that cannot be pushed off. Chances are you can delay most of what&rsquo;s on your agenda. You know it&rsquo;s true.</p><h3> What can I delegate? <br/>  </h3><p> The first question was about total elimination. The second question was about deferring something you will do. This question helps identify activities&mdash;the what&mdash;someone else can do. The other person might not complete them as nicely as you would, but most times it&rsquo;s better to unload and unburden yourself. After all, we&rsquo;re talking about your sanity.</p><h3> Who can help me? <br/>  </h3><p> This question is about &ldquo;the who&rdquo; can help you. Interestingly, in most cases, you don&rsquo;t actually need to delegate the activity to realize benefits. Solely identifying someone who could help you should you need it will relieve some stress. It&rsquo;s taking comfort in knowing there&rsquo;s a contingency plan, eh, person.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the next step I need to take (for this task, project, etc.)? <br/>  </h3><p> Oftentimes, people become consumed or stifled because they imagine eating the entire elephant in one sitting. If you allow yourself to focus on the entire project at once, you&rsquo;ll likely become overwhelmed. Concentrate on the next step&mdash;only the next step. That will keep you in motion and help you progress. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll be on a roll.</p><h3> If that doesn&rsquo;t turn out like I hope or expect, what would I do? <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of speculating. I like to plan and prepare for all contingencies, but not worry unnecessarily. Let&rsquo;s address the worrying. One of my favorite quotes is by Mark Twain. He said, I&rsquo;ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened. Simply imagine (don&rsquo;t dwell on) an outcome other than you&rsquo;d expect. Think through how you would handle it.</p><h3> When and why was I happiest? <br/>  </h3><p> Whenever most people encounter a tough situation or rough patch in their life, they try to fix the problem. Sometimes, trying to fix the problem is a problem. Instead of looking for a fix to the problem, remove yourself from it. Consider your conditions when you were happiest, most successful, and so on. (This works for small projects and processes as well.) What were they? Who surrounded you? What were your daily routines?</p><p> Perhaps you&rsquo;ve gotten away from some of the best parts of your life. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to resuscitate them. I&rsquo;m not speaking of living in the past. I&rsquo;m suggesting recognizing positive experiences and surroundings and reapplying them as appropriate.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> A question I am often asked by so many leaders at different points in their careers is, &ldquo;When is the best time to leave my current position?&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Of course if I had the perfect response I would share it with enthusiasm but the truth is, it depends. Everyone&rsquo;s situation is different and each of us possesses a certain level of risk-taking and tolerance for a challenging work environment.</p><p> A week ago I was working with a young leader who was toying with making a move. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do although his current situation was growing more and more unbearable. He was feeling unappreciated and not given much encouragement from his supervisor for a job he was in for about a year. We spent time talking about the pros and cons of leaving or taking the risk of applying for a new role. Either way the decision wouldn&rsquo;t be an easy one.</p><h3> Here are 7 things to think about when a job change is calling to you: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Ask yourself what is happening in my current role? <br/>  </h3><p> Taking an honest look at what has gone wrong in our present position isn&rsquo;t so easy, yet major league necessary. What exactly isn&rsquo;t working and why? Perhaps your boss is part of the derailment. Maybe the job responsibilities aren&rsquo;t what you had imagined. And there may be some truth to the fact that you might be contributing to the problems.</p><h3> 2. Think if there are ways to make the job better <br/>  </h3><p> When we are contemplating a job move, we may want to first see if there is anything we can do to make things better.</p><li> Are there skills I need to learn to be stronger?</li><li> Can I talk to my supervisor about my challenges?</li><li> How can I call on my co-workers to help?</li><li> What changes can I make to have a higher performance level?</li><li> What&rsquo;s preventing me from excelling?</li><h3> 3. Take a look from your boss&rsquo;s vantage point <br/>  </h3><p> Although not something we may want to consider, it can be a helpful exercise to try to understand why our boss feels the way she does. Identify why your boss doesn&rsquo;t see all your hard work. Are we putting forth our best effort? Also, our bosses are sometimes under severe pressure to perform and some of that anxiety may spill over onto us.</p><h3> 4. Decide on your level of risk-taking <br/>  </h3><p> While some leaders look forward to change and movement, others have a more difficult time stepping outside their comfort zone. Are you comfortable taking the risk to try a new position knowing it may not work out? There are unknowns in a new job from the responsibilities to a different type of supervisor to new team members. Just consider your individual risk-taking levels.</p><h3> 5.

In this crowded space, content creation will give you an edge.</p><p> Spending your best energy on developing a media-minded, content-focused business will be your ace in the hole. Turn your small business into a thriving media empire with this simple process.</p><h3> The Stats <br/>  </h3><p> We get it. You don&rsquo;t want to waste your time on another growth scheme. We certainly don&rsquo;t want you to either.</p><p> But the content creation data is hard to argue with. Check out these stats on media-driven businesses</p><li> Companies who blog get 55% more web traffic than those that don&rsquo;t</li><li> Media focused businesses have 97% more inbound links than those who are not</li><li> B2B marketers with blogs generate 67% more leads than their non-blogging competitors</li><p> The only person you&rsquo;ll hurt by ignoring these stats is yourself and your business, because here&rsquo;s the real kicker&hellip;</p><h3> How it Works <br/>  </h3><p> The lead conversion stats on your website can be discouraging. You&rsquo;re tired of working hard for minimal results. We don&rsquo;t blame you. That&rsquo;s why as a small business owner, you have to rewire your brain and redirect your energy to creating content. It is, bar none, the most powerful tool in your toolbox.</p><p> The process is pretty simple. You generate great, keyword-optimized content that attracts people to your website. Those visitors become new leads for your business when they join your email list.</p><p> Next thing you know, you have a faithful following who regularly read, like, and promote your blog across the internet and social media channels.</p><p> This content promotion, through the magic of keyword optimization and strategic link building, increases your rankings on Google, which leads to more inbound traffic on your website. More traffic means more exposure. More exposure means more leads. More leads mean more clients, and more clients mean&hellip;that&rsquo;s right&hellip;more money.</p><h3> Getting in the Game <br/> <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-You-Should-be-Turning-Your-Small-Business-Into-a-Media-Company-Sweet-Fish-Media-2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Why You Should be Turning Your Small Business Into a Media Company | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-You-Should-be-Turning-Your-Small-Business-Into-a-Media-Company-Sweet-Fish-Media-2-1024x400.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> There is no one that knows your business better than you. You are the secret to your business&rsquo; success. This is the perfect opportunity to put your expertise out there and prove yourself as the expert in the marketplace.</p><p> Gary Vaynerchuk, world-renowned media expert and host of the #AskGaryVee podcast, has seen first hand how a shift in focus toward content marketing can turn the tide for a small business. Gary took his family&rsquo;s $3 million wine business and turned it into a $60M powerhouse in just five years.</p><p> <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-You-Should-be-Turning-Your-Small-Business-Into-a-Media-Company-Sweet-Fish-Media-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Why You Should be Turning Your Small Business Into a Media Company | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-You-Should-be-Turning-Your-Small-Business-Into-a-Media-Company-Sweet-Fish-Media-3-1024x400.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> It&rsquo;s going to take time and commitment to shift your focus from traditional to content marketing and get the results you&rsquo;re looking for. Turning your business into a media company isn&rsquo;t going to happen overnight, but it is the smartest way to grow your business.</p><h3> Where to Start <br/>  </h3><p> Becoming a media company will look different for everyone. You&rsquo;ll need to define the process and find the tools that work best for you.</p><p> Buzzfeed, for instance, puts out insane volumes of content throughout the day on a variety of topics, both serious and satirical. Seth Godin, on the other hand, only publishes one piece per day.</p><p> Depending on your business model and market, your strategy for content creation will vary. Create flexible structures that can be adjusted as you learn more about what your growing audience loves and finds valuable. The more strategically targeted your content, the more likely it is to be shared and promoted. And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to take the time to survey the available tools and leverage the platforms that are right for the audience you&rsquo;re trying to reach. Not all content creation and publishing tools are created equal. Don&rsquo;t worry, though, the Sweet Fish Media blog is chocked full of stellar content building resources to help you out of the nest.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve worked hard to get here. Becoming a media-focused company is your next step in achieving the goals you set out for when you started this thing.</p><p> <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-You-Should-be-Turning-Your-Small-Business-Into-a-Media-Company-Sweet-Fish-Media-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Why You Should be Turning Your Small Business Into a Media Company | Sweet Fish Media\" src=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Why-You-Should-be-Turning-Your-Small-Business-Into-a-Media-Company-Sweet-Fish-Media-4-1024x400.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> Making it Work for You <br/>  </h3><p> Your business is your baby, and you know it better than anyone else out there. But as a business owner in this day and age, you also have to start expanding your digital footprint.</p><p> The harsh truth of life is that we all only have 24 hours in a day. You have clients to woo, teams to lead, bills to pay, and, despite your best efforts to avoid it altogether, you need to sleep. But, unlike you, your web presence never needs to take time off.</p><p> While you are masterfully handling the day-to-day operations, that clever article you posted earlier in the week is driving traffic straight to you behind the scenes.</p><p> Becoming a media company by changing your focus from traditional to content marketing is one of the best ways to grow your business and reach your goals. We want to make sure that you have everything you need to be successful.</p>",

    "link": "do-you-know-these-8-costs-of-having-to-replace-an-employee",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> A scary statistic thrown around is that turnover costs an organization 150% of an employee&rsquo;s salary to replace them &mdash; and even more if that employee skews toward the senior side. <br/>  </h3><p> But it isn&rsquo;t just a corporate urban legend. Employee turnover really can be that costly, or even more so.</p><p> According to Forbes:</p><li> <p>  It costs between 30% and 50% of their annual salary to replace entry-level employees </p></li><li> <p>  It costs upward of 150% of their annual salary to replace mid-level employees </p></li><li> <p>  It costs upward of 400% of their annual salary to replace high-level or highly specialized employees </p></li><p> To reiterate: 400%! That can be astronomical for many companies. To figure out just how essential employee retention should be to your company strategy and goals, look into the eight hidden costs of employee turnover and how the cost of continually replacing employees can be insurmountable over the long run.</p><p> First, we can look at the clearer or more obvious costs of having to replace an employee.</p><h3> 1. Seeking out a replacement <br/>  </h3><p> Your organization may decide to pay an outside recruitment or headhunting firm. That&rsquo;s a flat rate over a certain period of time you will have to absorb into your budget &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s worth it to find the best employee for the empty role.</p><p> However, even if you do all recruiting in-house, your staff will be burdened and need to get paid for their work. Maybe they&rsquo;ll work extra hours, or maybe your turnover rate is so high you have to invest in more human resources personnel. And if you&rsquo;re a small company, this expense can quickly get out of hand. No matter how you go about it, there will always be a dollar figure attached to the work of actually finding potential job candidates.</p><h3> 2. Interviewing job candidates <br/>  </h3><p> Reading hundreds of resumes and interviewing a dozen candidates take a lot of time, and time, of course, is money. In addition to consuming your staff&rsquo;s time, especially if you&rsquo;re looking for senior-level, highly specialized job candidates, you will likely have to pay for airfare, transportation, and lodging for top talent to visit your offices for an interview &mdash; not to mention follow-up interviews. Costs can quickly add up.</p><h3> 3. Training new hires <br/>  </h3><p> In 2014, the Association for Talent Development found that the cost of training a single new hire averages $1,208, and it can go much higher for specialized industries or off-site seminars. And that doesn&rsquo;t take into account the time a manager or peer takes from their day to assist a new hire as they get adjusted to the new systems, software, and procedures. If your employee turnover is high, that number just increases exponentially.</p><p> The first three line items in the cost of employee turnover are some of the more outright costs, but there are more hidden costs that can add up to much, much more &mdash; and they&rsquo;re harder to calculate.</p><h3> 4. Loss of coworker morale <br/>  </h3><p> Nobody wants to work in a revolving door. If the cubicle next to them seems to have a different body in it every few months or every year, it can be hard for even your top performer to keep up the happy face. Employees begin to question why their company can&rsquo;t keep talented individuals, and the low morale only spreads when they&rsquo;re the ones stuck picking up the slack until you find a replacement. Imagine having to teach a new hire the same systems every few months just to have them leave. You can see the frustration that would build. Before long, you&rsquo;ll probably be paying the turnover costs of that top performer too.</p><h3> 5. Drops in employee productivity <br/>  </h3><p> Related to the low morale is lower engagement, which means lower productivity. According to  <u>  <a href=\"http://good.co/blog/2013/11/13/workplace-happiness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Good.co  </a> </u> :</p><li> Engaged employees perform 20% better than their disengaged counterparts</li><li> Disengaged workers cost the United States $450 to $550 billion a year in lost productivity</li><p> Low morale doesn&rsquo;t just lead to more turnover; it can cost you boatloads of money even if that employee sticks around. And it doesn&rsquo;t even account for the cost of your employees being overworked in the wake of someone quitting.</p><h3> 6. Hits to your company&rsquo;s reputation <br/>  </h3><p> Employees aren&rsquo;t the only ones who hurt from turnover; your customers may start to question your stability and reputation as a company if their point of contact within your organization changes monthly from Joe to Sue to Dave to Carla. Building a strong client or customer base is about building a relationship, and that relationship will be on shaky ground if they&rsquo;re always being introduced to a new face of the company.</p><p> Worse, important client needs can slip through the cracks while you&rsquo;re in limbo looking for a replacement. This kind of customer experience could have a ripple effect across potential customers and clients, especially if you build a reputation of not being able to retain talent, which would cause immeasurable potential profit loss over the long haul.</p><h3> 7. Customer loss via employee loyalty <br/>  </h3><p> Maybe the employee who left your company was a star and built strong, lasting relationships with your clients. You run the risk of the clients also abandoning you when that top performer leaves you. Sure, you probably have rules in place about this, but they won&rsquo;t stop this from happening entirely.</p><h3> 8. Lost organizational knowledge <br/>  </h3><p> It can take a while to become acclimated to a new company &mdash; and not just in terms of job training. A longtime employee knows that George is the contact person for IT issues and has formed a working relationship there. They know that PASSWORD2 is the default password for all internal applications. They know that Lucy leaves early on Thursdays to take her daughter to dance class, so all work should be handed in by then. This kind of &ldquo;insider&rdquo; company knowledge doesn&rsquo;t come quickly and isn&rsquo;t easy to teach. Fully infiltrating a new hire into your company requires patience and a lot of assistance from your existing staff. Meaning it costs dollars.</p><p> There are both clear and hidden costs of employee turnover, but all should make you boost the resources you put into employee retention. Because every dollar spent now could save hundreds further down the line.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> There is a huge unmet demand to provide a solution that can marry the client&rsquo;s values with their valuables.</h3><p> <br/> Advisors need to know that their client&rsquo;s life experience, the lessons learned and the hard won wisdom cannot be listed on a balance sheet or constrained to a legal document.</p><p> Professionals in Wealth Management, Succession Planning and Estate Planning are keenly aware of the failure rates related to inter-generational wealth transfers. Regardless of size many estates fail in the second generation and fewer still survive the third. The reasons have less to do with math and much more so with the &lsquo;human&rsquo; factor. Strategies currently employed by the industry to deal with this problem are found to be wanting.</p><p> The answer lies in finding a way for succeeding generations to take responsibility for, as well as &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; of, the gifts they receive. But, they cannot be expected to be invested in perpetuating the family narrative if they don&rsquo;t know it. Appreciation of the herculean efforts, the incredible risks, the sweat, the tears and the vision it took to create the wealth can be accomplished, to a degree, through sharing the story. When heirs know their history and understand their unique family narrative they more readily see themselves as an integral part of that greater story.</p><h3> There are problems though when contemplating building a legacy.</h3><p> <br/> Too many assume a family history needs to be a written story, edited and published in a book. Many also fail to see the value in such an exercise, believing it too pretentious. Beyond this humility, they face the challenges of: feeling they lack the requisite skills, a sense of being overwhelmed by the task, not knowing where to begin, and lastly, procrastination.</p><p> To address this problem, Ascent Private Capital Management, a private banking unit of U.S. Bank has hired an historian to manage an asset that some families cherish as much as their money: their legacies.</p><p> &ldquo;We know that managing the wealth of families is much more than managing their money,&rdquo; said Scott Winget, Ascent&rsquo;s senior managing director and head of wealth impact planning. &ldquo;Using a family history helps establish what a family&rsquo;s values are.&rdquo;</p><p> I applaud Ascent&rsquo;s vision; it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. It would be nice though if other firms would embrace this initiative and unlike Ascent, provide it to some of those families who don&rsquo;t quite have $50 Million to invest.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Numbers don&rsquo;t lie. On the other hand, we often lie to ourselves when we don&rsquo;t know the numbers. <br/>  </h3><p> Gut decisions are good, but if we can access the numbers to help us make better decisions, the numbers are invaluable.</p><p> What numbers am I talking about?</p><p> Results-based numbers including the following five:</p><h3> 1. Future Sales <br/>  </h3><p> A number, presented monthly, of new prospects, hot prospects, potential sales, future clients in your pipeline, number of new clients, and sources. These can help us by measuring ourselves through looking back and looking forward, determining trends, and making decisions about marketing strategies and sales skills. Without them we are guessing and assuming.</p><h3> 2. Referrals <br/>  </h3><p> The number of referrals from clients, prospects, strategic alliances, etc. are invaluable to track. These numbers, viewed and discussed monthly, can help determine trends up or down, and help to identify areas of focus if the numbers are of concern.</p><h3> 3. Website Analytics <br/>  </h3><p> Website analytics are critical. Accessing the data on how many people are coming to your website, when, what pages they visit, how long they are staying, where they came from, what is the bounce rate, etc. These are critical numbers to look at, probably weekly, to see if there are trends or problems. Problems could be that visitors are &ldquo;bouncing&rdquo; off your website before going anywhere but your home page. That is a bad sign for the compelling nature of your home page and probably needs to be changed. You probably already have analytics set up on your website and if not, you can set them up for free at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\">   www.google.com/analytics  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 4. Social Media Analytics <br/>  </h3><p> For professional purposes, we usually don&rsquo;t spend time on social media reaching out to clients, prospects, and strategic alliances for fun. We are doing it for business. So, compare the number of followers, interactions, connections, how many people are actually engaging with your social media sites, and the views on the content you post. If nothing is going on (which can be the case) then stop wasting the time to use social media OR try new things and see if your results change. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter have analytics as well as programs like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite.com  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 5. Marketing Events <br/>  </h3><p> The best numbers to track from a seminar or event you host are not just the number of people that came to the dinner or the number of sales closed. It is of course those numbers along with the number of appointments scheduled, appointments held, and the amount of the sales. These numbers need to coordinate with the amount of money spent on invitations, mailing lists, dinner, and handouts, as well as the time spent by staff on managing the event, following up, and the cost of materials printed. This is the only way to measure real seminar success and it points us directly to areas of improvement.</p><p> If you aren&rsquo;t already looking at your business analytics, now is a great time to take a few moments and put in place some systems to measure your numbers. And if you already have the numbers at your access, now is a great time to start looking at them consistently. I know it helps to make smarter decisions, and who doesn&rsquo;t need a few more of those.</p>",

    "title": "It's Time for Feminism Reform",
    "link": "its-time-for-feminism-reform",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s the presidential political season here in the U.S.</p><p> This is the time where politicians on both sides of the aisle start talking about how they can reform various aspects of government. True reform on any political issue is rarely the result, but sometimes we take a few small steps in the right direction. This is precisely what needs to happen with feminism.</p><h3> We need reform! <br/>  </h3><p> I love my fellow sisters. I have used my career to date to try to empower women rather than to drag them down. In my mind this is the essence of what it means to be a feminist. Unfortunately, many of us have lost sight of how this feminism thing works. By definition, feminism is defined as: &ldquo;the advocacy of women&rsquo;s right&rsquo;s on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.&rdquo; This notion of global &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo; is not only unattainable; but it is unreasonable.</p><p> The segments of the feminism party are many and varied. Like many things in government and even in life, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Truthfully, how do you satisfy all women without tripping over something completely unique to a sub-demographic? It is impossible.</p><h3> Started from the bottom now we&rsquo;re here&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> Here&rsquo;s what I see. We have young women who see any act of chivalry by a man as an affront to their independence. We have a group of women that are anti-men everything and remain ready to spit fire at the sight of a man &ndash; whether he is supportive of women progressing or not. Finally, we have some women represented in leadership across Corporate America, Technology and the sciences &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t the optimal number, but some of us have arrived. Yet, those select few who have reached these heights make it harder for other women to rise whether out of pure malice, jealousy or poor attempts at trying to mimic the hard-nosed leadership men exhibit almost innately.  </p><p> At the other end of the spectrum, we have some phenomenal women of all ages and backgrounds creating positive networks and movements at a grassroots level. Last but not least, we have women like me who are huge champions of women from all walks of life; but are reluctant to wear the feminism badge because the overall goal and message is lost on us. I&rsquo;d like to think of the latter group as the Independents of Feminism. We&rsquo;re unsure of where feminism is going and we don&rsquo;t have any one in particular representing our interests.</p><p> No movement is effective unless there is an overarching vision for people to sink their teeth into. Take the workplace for instance, you can hire a gazillion workers to work for you, but if they don&rsquo;t understand your expectations or vision for the company &ndash; their work is meaningless.</p><h3> I have created a short plan of reform for feminism. It is one that I believe will both unite and provide clarity around what we want. Here are some suggestions: <br/>  </h3><li> <p>  The issues are varied, but we have to own them collectively. What I experience as a Black woman is not the same as what as what a Latina or White woman experience. Don&rsquo;t patronize me or belittle my experience and I will do the same for you. We need to take the time to understand all of the issues at hand. They all matter and have to be raised collectively. </p></li><li> <p>  Every man walking this earth is not our enemy. There are some men that think we are doing fine for being women. Those guys are jerks and deserve our death stares. However, there are some men that had nothing to do with creating our plight and want to see us win. We can be &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, &ldquo;boss babes&rdquo;, &ldquo;queens&rdquo; and all of those monikers and not have to denigrate all men. </p></li><li> <p>  Less talk, more uplifting. Some of you ladies are quick to claim being a feminist on social media and in social situations &ndash; yet you put other women down constantly. When was the last time you helped another woman out of the goodness of your heart? Have you mentored a young girl ever? More importantly, if your younger self met the present day &ldquo;you&rdquo; would she be proud? Talk is cheap. When I think back to the most treacherous bosses I have had in my career, they weren&rsquo;t men &ndash; they were women. From the PTA to the workplace, we need to be uplifting one another not cutting each other down. </p></li><p> At a minimum, these are the things that we need to get straight before any of us proudly wear the feminism badge. I pray we can turn this around before either of my daughters becomes young women, because right now the feminism movement needs a lot of help.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Most people have probably heard this Chinese proverb: the best time to plant a tree was yesterday. The second best time is now. <br/>  </h3><p> Investing is no different. But how do you start the process?</p><p> Thankfully, wading into the world of investing on your own isn&rsquo;t as scary as you might think.</p><p> Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are great options for the new investor, and they don&rsquo;t take a finance degree to figure out. Read on to learn how you can go from being a green investor to a grizzled veteran.</p><h3> Investing Basics <br/>  </h3><p> The first thing to lock down is your reason for investing. Do you want to fund a nest egg for your retirement? Do you want to save for your child&rsquo;s education? Do you want to create wealth to last for generations? Having a clear reason will help determine what you invest in, what your timeline is and how much money you need.</p><p> Investors should aim to have a diverse portfolio, made up of national and international companies and small and large firms. Some companies provide more growth while others yield income for the investor. A mix of income and growth companies is vital.</p><p> Most people hear about the stock market in terms of companies like Apple, Google and General Motors. But a better way to gauge the overall economy is through indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&amp;P 500. These indexes act as holistic snapshots of the stock market, and avoid focusing on specific companies or areas of the market.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let these indexes intimidate you: They&rsquo;re not as complicated as they may appear. Like with most investment related information, learning the basics will make everything else easier to understand.</p><h3> Why Mutual Funds or ETFs? <br/>  </h3><p> So once you have a basic knowledge of the stock market, what kinds of investments should a newbie look to make? Many people decide to invest by picking single companies, but holding your money in a few corporations exposes your investment to a lot of risk.</p><p> Mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds are like baskets that hold a cornucopia of funds. One share in a mutual fund guarantees you more diversity than a single share in Apple, and that inherent diversity makes it a perfect choice for the new investor.</p><p> By buying mutual funds or ETFs that hold shares in a variety of companies, you lower the chances that the market&rsquo;s downturns will affect you too much. Plus, many of these funds have low fees, so you won&rsquo;t lose a huge chunk of your earnings. Find a fund that charges 1% or less in fees &ndash; any higher and you&rsquo;re getting ripped off.</p><p> For retirement investing, you can choose a 401k, offered by an employer, or an Individual Retirement Plan, which you can open through a firm such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard.</p><h3> How to Choose? <br/>  </h3><p> Funds can be conservative, aggressive or in between, depending on the investor&rsquo;s needs. More conservative funds are good for seniors getting ready for retirement, while aggressive funds are better for younger people who have decades to save and wait.</p><p> Some people choose to invest more aggressively or conservatively than the norm. Older people whose risk tolerance is low might stick to income securities such as bonds, while younger people who want to grow their assets will choose more stocks.</p><p> No matter how you invest, it helps to be rational and calm. Too many investors let their emotions dictate their financial decisions. Many choose to sell when the market is down, panicking at the thought of losing all their money.</p><p> Remember to stick to your original plan. The market can swing up and down, but continue to invest carefully and regularly. The best investors focus on long-term goals, tempering their reactions to short-term market volatility.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re a new investor, the key is to start small and think big. You shouldn&rsquo;t throw your life savings into the stock market right away; take some time to learn the process and monitor how your funds are performing. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics, you can start building towards a financial future to look forward to.</p><p> That&rsquo;s when investing really starts to get fun.</p>",

They were:<li> Will This Exit Path Meet The Owner&rsquo;s Goals?</li><li> Will The Owner Exchange Time for Risk?</li><li> How Much Risk Can An Owner Stomach?</li><li> Has the Owner Any Made Promises?</li><li> How Old Are The Intended Successors?</li>Once you answer all of these questions, you can move on to important questions about the successors and owner and then to your role in explaining the issue of minimum value.<h3> Questions About Successors</h3><strong> 1. Are Successors Capable of Being Owners?</strong>Do successors have the ability to run the business without the owner? If an owner assures you that they do, ask how she knows that. For how long has the owner ever left the employees in charge and in what shape was the business when she returned?Good, even great, key employees do not necessarily equal good or even passable, successor owners.<strong> 2. If Capable, Do Successors Want To Be Owners?</strong>Does your client know or assume that a co-owner or key employee wants to be owners? Many motivated, loyal employees are quite content to be employees. They don&rsquo;t want to take on the stress, hours, sleepless nights, and level of risk that ownership entails. To succeed as owners, successors must possess the same spark that motivated the owner each day to make something of the business--no matter the risk or personal cost.<strong> 3. Do The Successors Understand The Risk Involved In Ownership?</strong>Many employees are both capable and willing to become owners&mdash;until they learn that they will have to put their own skin in the game. Depending on the structure of the buy-in, their personal funds (or loans) will pay for initial ownership interest and fund ongoing business operations.The requirement for employees to put skin in the game can be a deal breaker so you must raise the issue early in the process.<h3> What Do Owners Expect?</h3>Some owners want a strong link between the privilege of purchasing the company&rsquo;s stock &ldquo;at a bargain price&rdquo; with the risk that successors bear. They believe that KEG members only become true owners when they bear risk&mdash;especially when there is a slowdown in cash flow. In that case, you must ask how much risk they want their successors to assume. Are they willing to look exclusively to the future cash flow of the company to provide successors a means to pay them or will they require their successors to rely on other assets?<strong> You might suggest that:</strong>1. The owner requires members of the KEG use their money for the down payment for initial stock purchase, or that each key employee use personal collateral (such as a residence) as security for any installment note.2. The owner requires buyers to obtain a bank loan for the entire initial purchase (with or without the company&rsquo;s guarantee).<h3> The Conversation About Minimum Value</h3>We&rsquo;ve already mentioned that you are the best person to communicate to your client&rsquo;s successors that they will have to use personal assets to fund their buy in and possibly ongoing business operations.You are also the person best suited to explain to all parties the need to place a minimum value on the company.While you may understand the role, a low enterprise value plays in this type of transfer, I can almost guarantee that your clients do not. Even among those who do, there are many who find the idea of a low value emotionally unpalatable. To them, a low value gives away part of the business.You must persuasively and accurately communicate that selling a company to an insider for the lowest enterprise value permitted by a qualified appraiser is the best way for owners to maximize the money they receive. By using a low value for the initial purchases of ownership, more of the company&rsquo;s cash flow remains to be paid directly to the owner who pays a tax on it. Less cash flow needs to be diverted from the company and paid to the buying insider (who is taxed on it) before paying the net amount to the seller who is taxed on the gain. Using a low defensible value, properly designed, reduces the amount of cash flow the company needs to create to pay the owner the same amount of money, after tax.In this article and the one that preceded it, we&rsquo;ve covered the four tasks you must undertake when you learn an owner/client has chosen this type of transfer:<li> Assess the prospects for success</li><li> Assess the intended successors</li><li> Extract the owner&rsquo;s expectations</li><li> Explain the role of minimum value.</li>Of course, there are many more once owners realize that there are many plan designs and many decisions to be made as they move forward in their Exit Planning.",

    "content": "<p> The last time gold had a quarter this strong, Ronald Reagan was a year into his second term as president, the Soviet Union was taking its final gasp and the U.S. was still reeling from the Challenger explosion. In the first quarter, the yellow metal rose 16.5 percent, its best three-month performance since 1986, mostly on fears of negative interest rates and other global central bank policies.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-gold-just-had-its-best-quarter-in-30-years-04012016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold Just Had Its Best Quarter in 30 Years\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-gold-just-had-its-best-quarter-in-30-years-04012016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> Bloomberg writes that the current gold rally has  <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-31/gold-in-asia-heads-for-biggest-quarterly-advance-in-25-years\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  &ldquo;  <u>   cemented its status as a store of value.  </u>  &rdquo; </a>  Before now, a  gold bear market persisted not because the metal had lost its status necessarily, but because of the strong U.S. dollar and, more significantly, positive real interest rates. According to Pierre Lassonde, cofounder of Franco-Nevada, gold is the fourth most liquid asset in the world.</p><p> As I&rsquo;ve mentioned many times before&mdash;during interviews and in the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/subscribe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Investor Alert  </a> </u>  and my CEO blog  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/subscribe/FTSubscribe.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Frank Talk  </a> </u> &mdash;gold has historically performed best when real rates turned negative. We were one of the earliest to discuss this important relationship on a regular basis, and now I&rsquo;m starting to see it covered frequently in the mainstream media.</p><p> To get the real rate, you subtract the current consumer price index (CPI) reading, or inflation, from the government bond yield. When yields are low&mdash;or negative, as they are now&mdash;it encourages smart investors to seek other stores of value, including gold.</p><p> Below, you can see that when gold prices peaked at $1,900 per ounce in August 2011, real interest rates were close to negative 4 percent. A five-year Treasury bond yielded only 0.9 percent&mdash;and that&rsquo;s before inflation took 3.8 percent. (Decades ago, when I was a young analyst in Canada, we would compareeverything to the five-year government bond yield.) But as real rates rose, gold prices fell. Now the reverse is happening. </p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-gold-rebound-linked-to-fall-in-interest-rates-04012016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Gold Rebound Linked to Fall in Interest Rates\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-gold-rebound-linked-to-fall-in-interest-rates-04012016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><h3> Double the Gold Returns under Negative Real Rates?</h3><p> <br/> Most investors look only at nominal interest rates. This is only the tip of the iceberg. The British author and playwright Oscar Wilde wrote: &ldquo;Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.&rdquo; Along those lines, smart investors know that money flows to the highest real interest rate.</p><p> I call this the Fear Trade.</p><p> &ldquo;When real rates are negative, gold returns tend to be twice as high as the long term average,&rdquo; the  <u>  World Gold Council (WGC) </u>  writes its latest report. &ldquo;Even if real rates are positive and as long as they are not significantly high (4 percent in our study), average gold returns remain positive.&rdquo;</p><p> Negative rates erode confidence in fiat currencies, which typically has benefited gold. A currency itself, gold is &ldquo;the only one that is not targeted directly by, and doesn&rsquo;t respond negatively to, expansionary monetary policies,&rdquo; the WGC writes.</p><p> The chart below shows the difference in the nominal and real yield curves for government bonds in a number of advanced economies. When you factor in inflation, investors of shorter-term government debt are actually paying the government to hold their money, a proposition that&rsquo;s hard to swallow.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-low-negative-government-bond-yields-convince-investors-to-look-elsewhere04012016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Low and Negative Government Bond Yields Convince Investors to Look Elsewhere\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-low-negative-government-bond-yields-convince-investors-to-look-elsewhere04012016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> The WGC points out that about 30 percent of global sovereign debt is now trading with subzero yields. That&rsquo;s $8 trillion! A further 40 percent has yields below 1 percent.</p><img alt=\"United States of America gold eagle coin\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-american-gold-eagle-coin-04012016.jpg\"/><p> This is just the latest reason why investors have been losing faith in central banks. In its most recent quarterly report, the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1603_ontherecord.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  </a> </u>  notes that investors&rsquo; &ldquo;confidence in central banks&rsquo; healing powers has&mdash;probably for the first time&mdash;been faltering,&rdquo; as it becomes more and more clear that room for additional policymaking is narrowing. If asset-buying programs, helicopter drops of money and negative interest rate policies fail to reverse the economic slowdown, what more is there?</p><p> These conditions have led to a surge in gold coin and bullion sales around the world. American Eagle consumers bought 83,500 ounces of the coin in February, a 351 percent increase from the 18,500 ounces sold in the previous February. The Perth Mint in Australia is also reporting huge sales volumes.</p><h3> Retail Investors Missing out on the Gold Rush</h3><p> <br/> Interest in gold bullion, however, hasn&rsquo;t seemed to translate fully into renewed interest in gold miners. So far this year, inflows into the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which invests in physical bullion, have accelerated as investors chase the rally.</p><img alt=\"where are the gold investors?\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-where-are-the-investors-gold-table-04012016.png\"/><p> <br/> At the other end is the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), which holds junior gold equities such as Northern Star, OceanaGold and Evolution Mining. Despite an increase in share price, we&rsquo;ve seen a net decrease in shares outstanding. Year-to-date, outflows have totaled $84 million. Flows out of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which holds senior gold stocks, have been even more dramatic, at $94 million.   </p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-retail-investors-bullish-bullion-bearish-gold-stocks-04012016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Retail Investors Bullish on Bullion, Bearish on Gold Stocks\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-01/COMM-retail-investors-bullish-bullion-bearish-gold-stocks-04012016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> This could be explained by investors taking profits off the table, unease with the volatile swings in the gold market lately or mistrust in mining stocks. In any case, many investors could be missing out on one of the most impressive gold rallies in a generation.

    "content": "<h3> How well do you know and understand your customers' expectations? <br/>  </h3><p> And why are they important? <br/> <br/> Merriam-Webster defines an expectation asa belief that something will happen or is likely to happen. <br/> <br/> But where do those beliefs, those expectations come from? <br/> <br/> There are a variety of ways that customer expectations are formed:</p><li> brand promise</li><li> marketing and advertising</li><li> stated outright, e.g., we do X</li><li> previous experience</li><li> word of mouth or reviews and feedback from other customers</li><li> from within ourselves, our own set of morals and values and how we would treat others</li><h3>  Expectations are funny things: <br/>  </h3><li> Customers have them, but they are not in control of them, not in control of the outcomes.</li><li> Customers have them, but companies must know them and understand them.</li><li> Companies set them (brand promise, service delivery, documentation, etc.), yet they have trouble delivering against them (consistently).</li><p> Understanding your customers' expectations helps you deliver against them - and deliver a great experience. The equation goes: Performance - Expectations = Satisfaction.</p><p> When the company and its employees know and understand those expectations, they can develop products and services, deliver service, interact with customers, and more in such a way that ensures they meet or exceed those expectations.  <br/> <br/> Yup. Expectations are funny things. It's why we see some of the quotes that we see, like... <br/> <br/> \"Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.\" <strong>  - Alexander Pope  </strong> <br/> <br/> \"You are your own worst enemy. If you can learn to stop expecting impossible perfection, in yourself and others, you may find the happiness that has always eluded you.\" <strong>  - Lisa Kleypas, Love in the Afternoon </strong> <br/> <br/> \"I find my life is a lot easier the lower I keep my expectations.\"  <strong>  - Bill Watterson </strong> <br/> <br/> \"My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.\" <strong>  - Stephen Hawking  </strong> <br/> <br/> \"Expectation is the root of all heartache.\" <strong>  - William Shakespeare </strong> <br/> <br/> Because expectations are important and interesting, they're a topic that makes the rounds of discussions, podcasts, and blog posts. Great to keep them alive! <br/> <br/> So it was great when, last week, Stan Phelps and I were invited to join the CMSConnected Show to answer the question, \"Are Expectations Too High for Customer Experience?\"</p><p> It was an engaging discussion, with hosts Stephen Saber and Scott Liewehr digging in to really try to understand the why behind these expectations. We answered questions like:</p><li> How do you define customer experience management?</li><li> Are customer expectations a myth?</li><li> How do companies measure and gauge customer expectations?</li><li> How are expectations increasing?</li><li> Why are expectations increasing</li><p> ​ To hear the answers to those questions and more, please  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cms-connected.com/Previous-Shows/Are-Expectations-too-High-for-Customer-Experience\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have a listen to the show  </a> </u> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bejoyable\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Tiffany Chi  </a> </u>  | From the <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a> and <u>  <a href=\"http://joyable.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Joyable  </a> </u></p><p> Luming Hao had always been the type to keep to himself. When he was in high school, his family moved a few times, and each time he found it hard to make new friends. &ldquo;Approaching groups of people seemed super scary,&rdquo; he remembers, &ldquo;I always thought I was just bad at that kind of thing.&rdquo; It was sophomore year when he first noticed that his discomfort around other people was more than just a feeling&ndash;it also manifested itself in physical symptoms. When he had to speak up in class, his heart would race. Sometimes, when Luming was especially nervous, his eyes would well up. But he&rsquo;d brush it off, thinking, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just tired&rdquo; or &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get enough sleep.&rdquo;</p><p> It wasn&rsquo;t until years later, when the tears came again during a work meeting, that he started to recognize a pattern. As part of his job as a software engineer, Luming attended weekly meetings where each member of the team stood up and reported on their plan for the week. Luming distinctly recalls that on that particular day, he noticed feeling less nervous than he usually did. But then, it was his turn to speak. &ldquo;I was talking, and I noticed my voice shake. Then my vision started started blurring,&rdquo; he said. He worried everyone else in the meeting noticed the tears too and was judging him. He went home feeling embarrassed and defeated.</p><p> That was when Luming started to think about looking for help. He looked online and discovered that there was a term for what he was experiencing: social anxiety.</p><h3> <strong>  What is social anxiety? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Social anxiety is when you feel nervous, tense, or uncomfortable in social situations because you&rsquo;re worried other people are judging you. Almost everyone has experienced feelings of social anxiety at one point or another. Life is rife with moments of self-consciousness&ndash;from job interviews to first dates, we all occasionally feel nervous around other people. But social anxiety becomes a problem when it&rsquo;s so frequent or intense that it gets in the way of important things in your life. You might not apply for a dream job because it requires an interview, or you might find it hard to be around even family and friends because you&rsquo;re so worried about what they think of you.</p><p> If social anxiety has prevented you from doing the things you want, like making new friends or going on dates, you&rsquo;re not alone. Social anxiety is one of the most common mental health conditions in the U.S., affecting 15 million adult Americans each year. According to the National Institute of Mental Health,  <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/social-phobia-among-adults.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">  1 in 8 Americans experience social anxiety during their life </a> (about 30 million).</p><h3> <strong>  Recognizing if you have social anxiety </strong></h3><p> <br/> While social anxiety always involves a fear of being judged negatively, the actual situations that cause this anxiety can vary greatly from person to person. Many people with social anxiety feel nervous in most situations that involve interacting with or performing in front of other people. But some people only experience social anxiety in particular situations, like speaking in front of others or hosting an event. For example, a person who is typically very outgoing and comfortable talking to strangers at parties might only have social anxiety when giving presentations. In fact, public speaking is one of the most common specific forms of social anxiety.</p><h3> Common situations in which people experience social anxiety: <br/>  </h3><li> Speaking in front of a group</li><li> Talking to strangers</li><li> Being the center of attention (like when you are hosting a dinner)</li><li> Speaking to authority figures (like your boss)</li><li> Answering the phone</li><li> Eating or drinking in front of others</li><li> Talking to someone you find attractive <br/>  </li><h3> Signs and Symptoms of Social Anxiety <br/>  </h3><p> People often think social anxiety is just a feeling, but it actually has four components: thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and behaviors. You might recall from Luming&rsquo;s story that he started to recognize his social anxiety when he noticed his nervousness was also accompanied by physical symptoms like trembling and crying. When you&rsquo;re anxious, the four components interact with and build upon each other, causing a cycle of anxiety. For example, here&rsquo;s how your anxiety might manifest itself if you&rsquo;re nervous about giving a presentation at work:</p><br /><p> Thoughts: Often, your anxiety will begin with a negative thought, like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to screw up&rdquo; or &ldquo;people will think I&rsquo;m stupid.&rdquo;</p><p> Feelings: These thoughts cause you to feel negative emotions, like stress or worry.</p><p> Physical Response: Your body reacts to your negative thoughts and feelings with a physical response like blushing, sweating, or shaking.</p><p> Behaviors: To reduce your anxiety, you do conscious or unconscious things like averting your gaze or hiding behind the podium (to prevent people from seeing you shake). Acting this way may make you think everyone else notices you look stiff (an anxious thought), which can then cause you to feel even more stressed (an anxious feeling).</p><p> People with social anxiety often don&rsquo;t realize when their behavior is being driven by anxiety. There are three types of behaviors that people with social anxiety tend to exhibit:</p><li> <strong>  Avoidance behaviors: </strong>  when you stay away from situations that make you anxious. For example, you might turn down opportunities to give presentations at work.</li><li> <strong>  Escape behaviors:  </strong> when you leave situations that make you anxious, like leaving a concert or party after just a few minutes because of your anxiety.</li><li> <strong>  Safety behaviors:  </strong> Actions you take to reduce your anxiety in social situations, like drinking to feel more comfortable or playing a game on your phone at lunch. In the example above, averting your gaze or hiding behind the podium during the presentation are safety behaviors. <br/>  </li><h3> What to do if you have social anxiety</h3><p> <br/> If you think you have social anxiety, the most important question to ask yourself is whether it  <u>  <a href=\"/category/personal-development\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   prevents you from achieving your goals  </a> </u> . For example, we mentioned earlier that a large majority of people report a fear of public speaking. You might be one of them. But if your job or goals don&rsquo;t require public speaking, then being afraid of it might not be a big deal. On the other hand, if your fear is keeping you from getting the promotion you want, or getting in the way of an important personal goal like giving a speech at your sister&rsquo;s wedding, then you might consider looking for help.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://joyable.com/research\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)  </a> </u>  is widely recognized as the most effective treatment for social anxiety. It&rsquo;s endorsed by leading mental health organizations, including the U.S.  <u>  <a href=\"http://nimh.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   National Institute of Mental Health  </a> </u>  (NIMH) and the U.K.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   National Health Service  </a> </u>  (NHS). CBT is a set of activities proven to reduce your anxiety through repeated practice. It consists of two main parts: cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy.</p><p> The cognitive part of CBT is based on the idea that it&rsquo;s not a social situation that makes you anxious, but your interpretation of that situation. For example, if you&rsquo;re having dinner with a friend and she leaves early, you can interpret this several ways. You might think she found dinner with you boring (leading you to feel anxious), or you might think she had a long day and was tired (and feel neutral). People with social anxiety tend to interpret situations in a disproportionately negative way. CBT teaches you to recognize and embrace the existence of alternate interpretations, allowing you to identify if there are other possible explanations that are less likely to trigger your anxiety.</p><p> The behavioral part of CBT involves gradually facing the situations that make you anxious in order to overcome your fear of them (this exercise is called an &ldquo;exposure&rdquo;). You probably imagine the worst-case scenario will happen if you confront these situations, so you tend to avoid them. However, when you actually place yourself in the situations you fear, you have two critical realizations: first, that the bad outcome you fear happens less often than you think, and second, even if it does, you can handle it. It&rsquo;s key that exposures are gradual: you start small with a situation that causes some anxiety but is doable, and then work your way up to situations that make you really anxious. For example, if giving a presentation makes you extremely anxious, to the point where you might even call in sick to avoid it, your first exposure would be a similar but less anxiety-inducing situation like telling a story to a group of friends. Once you learn to get comfortable in these practice situations, you&rsquo;ll be able to take your newfound confidence to more difficult situations you greatly fear or have been avoiding.</p><h3> Overcome social anxiety with Joyable&rsquo;s online CBT program</h3><p> <br/> We&rsquo;ve talked about how common social anxiety is, and how there&rsquo;s a proven solution to treat it (CBT). However, the shocking truth is that 85 percent of Americans who struggle with social anxiety each year  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/social-phobia-among-adults.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">   don&rsquo;t get help  </a> </u> . Why? Sometimes it&rsquo;s a lack of awareness that prevents people from seeking help. Sometimes, sadly, it&rsquo;s stigma. But even for those who know they have social anxiety and want help, there are huge cost and access barriers preventing them from getting treatment. The average cost of a single  <u>  45-minute session with a therapist is $161 </u>  in the U.S., and even if you can afford that, you might not be able to find an available therapist nearby. There aren&rsquo;t even close to enough therapists to treat the number of people struggling with social anxiety; about a third of the U.S. population (roughly 99 million people) lives in a mental health desert where there is a  <a href=\"http://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/HGDWReports/RT_App.aspx?rpt=HM\" target=\"_blank\">  shortage of mental health professionals </a> .</p><p> That&rsquo;s why we created Joyable. Joyable makes an effective, affordable solution for social anxiety accessible to all. We offer an online CBT program with the guidance of a personal coach to help you overcome your social anxiety. Because it&rsquo;s an online program with check-ins by phone, text, or email, you can use Joyable from the comfort and privacy of your own home. Research shows that  <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23252357\" target=\"_blank\">  online CBT is just as effective </a>  as in-person therapy, and for many, it&rsquo;s a lot more affordable. Because Joyable is self-paced, you can do activities when it&rsquo;s convenient and when you&rsquo;re motivated to work on your anxiety, rather than having to conform to someone else&rsquo;s schedule.</p><p> Overcoming social anxiety is hard work. With Joyable, you don&rsquo;t have to do it alone. When you start the program, you&rsquo;re paired with a personal coach. Your coach is your advocate and accountability partner. They&rsquo;re trained in CBT and help guide you if you have a hard time challenging your negative thoughts. They also give you an extra push when you need it to face situations you fear.</p><p> For Luming, his coach Julia was the best part of the Joyable program. Julia provided motivation and guided him through planning exposures, especially when he struggled to understand what they were at first. &ldquo;It felt like she was lighting a path through an otherwise dark forest,&rdquo; he said. He noted that without her continued encouragement, he &ldquo;might have quit.&rdquo; Before Luming started the program, he dreamed of changing jobs and moving to New York City, but his social anxiety thwarted him. When putting together his resume and portfolio, his head filled with negative thoughts like, &ldquo;this sounds pretentious&rdquo; or &ldquo;they&rsquo;re going to think it&rsquo;s stupid that I decided to include this project.&rdquo; Even if he managed to put together a decent portfolio, Luming was sure it wouldn&rsquo;t matter because he&rsquo;d fail any interview he got anyway. With Julia&rsquo;s guidance, Luming reinvigorated his job search and treated each phase&ndash;from phone screens to in-person interviews&ndash;as an exposure. He found preparing for and debriefing the interviews with Julia extremely helpful, and his confidence grew.</p><p> When I talked to him, Luming was in his new apartment in New York City. He had just moved there to start a great job, and he sounded optimistic. I asked him what he had learned and what advice he would give someone who had been in his shoes a few months ago&ndash;struggling with social anxiety and not knowing what to do about it. He said not to lose hope or to worry that you&rsquo;d need to invest years into therapy without seeing progress. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really helpful to see [that there are] patterns&rdquo; of negative thinking, he said. &ldquo;You can identify that this is something that happens to other people. Since there&rsquo;s a pattern to it, there&rsquo;s [a solution], CBT, that really works for this.&rdquo;</p><h3> Tips for people with Social Anxiety</h3><p> <br/> Here are some CBT-based tips for dealing with anxiety in the moment:</p><li> <strong>  Remember everyone is self-conscious. </strong>  Social anxiety is common, and many people experience it. If you&rsquo;re at a party and feel really anxious about introducing yourself to new people, remember that other people might feel the same way.</li><li> <strong>  Pause to examine the evidence. </strong>  When you&rsquo;re feeling anxious, take a moment and try to identify the anxious thoughts running through your head. Challenge them by asking questions like: &ldquo;What evidence do I have this is true?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is there another explanation for what happened?&rdquo; If someone responds curtly to you, you may have the anxious thought that &ldquo;they think I&rsquo;m boring.&rdquo; What if you challenged that thought and instead considered another explanation: maybe they were in a hurry, or maybe they were already on their way to talk to someone else when you approached them.</li><li> <strong>  Imagine the worse-case scenario. </strong>  Often, people with social anxiety think making a mistake will cause far worse consequences than it actually would. If you&rsquo;re worried about something like stumbling over your words&ndash;ask what would really happen if you stumbled over your words. Would people really laugh at you? They&rsquo;d probably barely notice it or quickly forget about it and continue the conversation.</li><li> <strong>  Remind yourself anticipation is worse than reality.  </strong> Often, our worries about an upcoming situation are worse than the situation itself. If you&rsquo;re worried about striking up a conversation because you think you&rsquo;ll have nothing to say, remind yourself that you only have to start with hello, and once you begin the conversation, it gets a lot easier.</li><li> <strong>  Bring a cheat sheet. </strong>  Before going into an anxiety-inducing situation, anticipate what anxious thoughts you&rsquo;ll have and challenge them on a piece of paper. Bring this slip of paper with you to the event (or save it on your phone) so if you start feeling nervous, you can look at it to remind yourself of your thought challenges and calm yourself down.</li><li> <strong>  Consider getting help. </strong>  If you find social anxiety is really impacting your life (for instance, getting in the way of your career or relationships, or making it hard to go to social events you want to attend), consider seeking out help through an evidence-based solution like CBT.</li><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> For Easter, when our son was three, we gave him a Viewmaster. <br/>  </h3><p> Both my husband and I had a Viewmaster as kids, so we thought he&rsquo;d like it. Ever since his grandma bought him a broken robot at a garage sale when he was two, our kiddo was totally obsessed with robots. (I&rsquo;m told that this was very advanced for a kid his age, and of course, as his mother, I recognized this to be true.) So when the Easter Bunny left a Viewmaster in Jeremy&rsquo;s Easter basket, he immediately started calling it his &ldquo;Robot Eyes&rdquo;.</p><p> For a solid week he wouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere without his Robot Eyes. He&rsquo;d be sitting in the backseat of the Prius, on the way to school, with a kid&rsquo;s cliff bar in one hand (hey, we were running late) and the other holding up his Robot Eyes, through which he claimed to see a whole new world.</p><p> I think in a sense that&rsquo;s what we all do. We all have our invisible Robot Eyes plastered to our faces. We&rsquo;ve held them up for so long that we don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re there. And we only have one disc, the one that came with the thing. And we flash through the pictures on that disc only seeing the same old pictures flash in front of us again and again. We forget that we can take them off. We forget that we can go to Target and buy a new disc, or ten new discs, or borrow someone else&rsquo;s disc. We only see what we see. And that&rsquo;s what the world has become to us. We don&rsquo;t know how to look at the people we meet, and the things that happen to us, as they really are. We only look through our Robot Eyes.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Viewmaster.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></p><p> Professionally, I&rsquo;ve found this to be a tremendous barrier. I&rsquo;ve decided, erroneously, who would benefit from working with me and who wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve not had important conversations that need to be had, because I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to be understood. I&rsquo;ve not brought ideas to the table, because I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be valued. And, after working with hundreds of leaders, I find I&rsquo;m not alone.</p><p> For leaders, this is a particularly tough challenge. With the intention of communicating authority, confidence, and credibility, we stop asking ourselves the questions. &ldquo;What is it Idon&rsquo;t know? Is there another way of doing this I haven&rsquo;t thought of? Is there another perspective that might be useful?&rdquo;</p><p> Bill Gates once said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not paid to know, I am paid to ask.&rdquo; And I think the richest man in the world might be on to something!</p><p> Personally, I have to work daily to remind myself to pry my Robot Eyes from my face. It&rsquo;s not something comes naturally. When I do, I feel a bit vulnerable and exposed, without the familiarity of my own world-view. Yet when I do, I&rsquo;m able to more fully connect. Connect with the people around me. Connect with opportunities I didn&rsquo;t know were there. Connect with solutions to problems I couldn&rsquo;t solve on my own.</p><p> The mind is such a funny thing. We think we&rsquo;re seeing things clearly. That we&rsquo;ve processed all the evidence and have come up with the most logical conclusion, and yet we come to find out that our own perceptions might be terrorizing our life.</p><p> Consider that many of our biggest challenges exist simply because of the way we&rsquo;re looking at things. Maybe we need a new disc, or two, or 10, for our viewfinders. Perhaps playing the same old disc over and over is what keeps us from the very things we most long to have &ndash; connection, opportunity, solutions.</p><p> Today I challenge you to focus more on what you don&rsquo;t know, on looking for a different way tosee. With an open mind, ask your direct reports and colleagues, particularly those who don&rsquo;t typically agree with you, about their ideas and perceptions (be sure to make it safe for them to share honestly, and be mindful of appreciating what they have to say).</p><p> Removing your personal Viewmaster isn&rsquo;t easy. But don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s not like getting a bad sunburn wearing strange glasses. Nobody can actually see the big white rings on your face where your &ldquo;Robot Eyes&rdquo; use to be.  Only you know that they were there.  And I won&rsquo;t tell if you don&rsquo;t.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> As a former buyer and executive, I&rsquo;ve been on the receiving end of sales presentations hundreds if not thousands of times. Some were good, some are bad, and some were funny or awkward. <br/>  </h3><p> But the best sales presentations were those that never even happened. Let me explain.</p><p> When I was a sales rookie, in my very first sales meeting, I walked in with 80-something slides and a compelling, inspiring (or so I thought) and highly engaging story of what my company did, why it mattered, and how it would benefit the client. And I got shot down. Even though I was too inexperienced to notice it, my buyer was turned off by my approach in a matter of minutes. As I went to slide after slide after slide, I became painfully aware that not only was my buyer not paying any attention to what I was saying, but he was in fact becoming actively and openly disengaged.</p><p> It was only years later that I realised that I made a classic beginner&rsquo;s mistake.</p><p> I pitched. And I failed.</p><h3> How to make a sales presentation <br/>  </h3><p> Fast forward a couple years. I walked into another meeting room with a couple of experienced, senior business developers. When they entered the room, something struck me. There was not a slide in sight. Just notepads, and a couple of questions scribbled down. This is how I ended up learning my first lesson on how to make a sales presentation: don&rsquo;t.</p><p> As soon as the client executives walked into the room, a lively and engaging conversation began to emerge. Both sides asked and answered questions, and as time passed the conversation on both sides became increasingly animated. The meeting went way past the initial 60 minute mark, and lasted just under two hours.</p><p> The next thing that happened was even more crazy: we actually ended up winning that deal. Without a single slide ever being presented.</p><p> I&rsquo;m often asked how to make a sales presentation. And, unsurprisingly, my answer today is very different from what I would&rsquo;ve said even a decade ago. Don&rsquo;t.</p><p> Unless you are explicitly asked by the client, for example when you&rsquo;re presenting to a committee at a fairly late stage in the sales process, I would recommend you simply walk into the room with some well-thought-out questions and a genuine desire to learn more about your buyer, their situation and their business.</p><p> Sure, that requires some courage. You will not be able to hide behind a fancy, great-looking deck. You will not be able to talk about how great your company is, or how many of the Fortune 500 are your clients. And you will not be able to showcase your razzle-dazzle animations.</p><p> But what you will get a return will be much, much more valuable. A great first conversation with a potentially interested buyer, and a real chance at forging a strong relationship with a fellow human being.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> When people anticipate a dialogue with a perceived downside-outcome, it causes anxiety eliciting a negative emotional response. <br/>  </h3><p> This type of dialogue is called a &ldquo;difficult conversation&rdquo; and it occurs whenever one or both people involved in the dialogue anticipates a less than optimal scenario with that other person in the conversation.</p><p> We are all human. We have emotions and react to criticism whether solicited or not. This anticipated perception of negativity is a barrier to open and honest dialogue. This scenario may result in people concealing a portion of the truth regarding a situation and hence the wrong solution to a problem or worse, a perpetuating bad situation and/or additional issues to resolve.</p><p> Most people want to &ldquo;look good&rdquo; and will do so at any cost. At ANY COST! Unknowingly, sabotage in the environment becomes prevalent to protect ones self-worth and to try and control what others perceive of us.</p><p> If transparency is a strategic outcome or heart-felt desire, guiding people in preparation for a difficult conversation is one tool to add to your development best practices. </p><h3> &ldquo;Difficult conversations&rdquo; can take place when giving feedback about: <br/>  </h3><li> Poor performance</li><li> Inappropriate behavior</li><li> Why promotion did not occur</li><li> Why bonus or raise did not occur</li><li> Etc.</li><h3> Each conversation should be approached differently depending on: <br/>  </h3><li> The individual</li><li> Circumstances</li><li> Magnitude of the behavior or performance</li><li> Etc.</li><h3> Know why you need to have the conversation: <br/>  </h3><li> What is your desired outcome?</li><li> What is the message you want to be heard?</li><li> How might you respond in a similar situation?</li><h3> You should also anticipate the possible outcomes and consequences of your conversation: <br/>  </h3><li> Possible reactions by individual</li><li> Possible change in your current relationship with that person</li><li> Possible effects on person&rsquo;s self-confidence, productivity, etc.</li><h3> Preparing for &ldquo;difficult conversations&rdquo;: <br/>  </h3><li> Have all documentation prepared and available</li><li> Choose a neutral venue</li><li> Be cognizant of timing (e.g., time of day)</li><li> Have specific examples supporting the conversation</li><li> Describe the individual&rsquo;s performance <li>  Begin with what the individual did well </li> <li>  Then discuss what the individual can do differently </li> <li>  Ask the individual about his/her own observations </li></li><h3> Be clear and specific in the desired new behaviors. Discuss approach with individual and ensure a collaborative effort and measurement expectations: <br/>  </h3><li> How will success be measured?</li><li> Modification begins immediately</li><li> Deadline to see new level of behavior and activity</li><li> Set dates for subsequent meetings to share feedback</li><p> Most importantly, ensure you come from a place of compassion. You may be angry or you may have been affected by the individual&rsquo;s respective behavior. They are human and you are human as well. No one is perfect! No one! Think about how you would want to be approached and how you would want the information presented to you. Although it&rsquo;s not always the best metric, it&rsquo;s a good bet. Note that there some of us that like the Band-aid ripped off quickly, hence, minimizing the pain, rather than a slow deliberate effort. Challenge without being antagonistic, offensive or demeaning. Work to be a teacher and mentor.</p><p> Having &ldquo;difficult conversations&rdquo; in the workplace are necessary. Open and honest communication makes for better relationships resulting in an optimal work environment. Recognizing the conversation is important and preparing can make all the difference in turning a &ldquo;difficult conversation&rdquo; into a productive and collaborative effort, stress-free.</p><p> The choice is yours!</p>",

She remembered the short video clip I had shown to illustrate the high cost of seemingly small distractions. (It&rsquo;s a clip of when I won an Olympic medal in the pool by a mere 4/100ths of a second because the swimmer in line for third place turned to look at me with only three strokes left in the race, costing him a medal.) The image stuck in her mind.</p><h3> Are you creating pictures people can easily remember you by? <br/>  </h3><p> Because I provide an image when I talk about distractions, people recall my message more readily during their daily experiences. Every time they hear a sports announcer say, &ldquo;Can you believe how close that was?&rdquo; they remember my presentation about distractions and recall their need to stay focused on what matters most so they can succeed sooner.</p><p> A picture is worth way more than a thousand words. When you link an idea, issue, or threat to a relevant familiar image, people remember you and your point much more easily than they would relying words alone.</p><p> Dave McHugh, a friend and a successful advisor with Edward Jones, used to meet with me when I first started as an advisor at Morgan Stanley. Dave was working with New York Life back in 2001. The door to my office had two vertical columns of four small window panes. One day Dave described a product that helped with diversification. He glanced at my door, then proceeded to describe how diversification worked by illustrating his point with my door.</p><p> He explained that that if one small pane in my door got damaged, only that one piece of glass would need fixing; the whole window would not be ruined like it would be if it were a single, large pane of glass. I used Dave&rsquo;s illustration with my clients. After 15 years, I and many of my clients still remember that image. (Thanks Dave!)</p><h3> How do you make sure you remain top of mind for clients and prospects? <br/>  </h3><p> Here are some more pictures you can paint for those you advise:</p>Turbulence: &ldquo;Experiencing turbulence during a flight is never fun, and neither is market turbulence. However, just like when you&rsquo;re in a plane, sometimes the only way to arrive at your final destination is to continue flying through the unpleasant bumps. The ride may be a little rougher for a while, but know that it will pass.&rdquo;<p> Traffic lights: &ldquo;There will be specific times we&rsquo;ll make decisions together to move forward &ndash; just like with a green light. There will also be times where we need to do absolutely nothing, to ensure we don&rsquo;t move&hellip;like at a red light.</p><p> &ldquo;What I never want you to experience again regarding finances and your financial well being is a yellow-light experience.\"</p><p> &ldquo;Think about what happens at yellow lights.&rdquo;</p><p> The client usually responds, &ldquo;I either speed up or slow down,&rdquo; (or you can answer your own prompt).</p><p> &ldquo;Yes, and right before that, you experience a split-second, frantic thought process, trying to decide what to do.</p><p> &ldquo;We make that frenzied decision while speeding along in a heavy moving object, possibly accompanied by people we love, and we make potentially life-changing decisions on the fly.</p><p> &ldquo;When we work together, you will never have yellow-light experiences when it comes to your finances.&rdquo;</p><p> Give people a memorable image, and they&rsquo;ll keep thinking about you and what you said.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> 1. What is the current state of the LTC insurance market? <br/>  </h3><p> After a rapid expansion through the 1990s, the long-term care industry has continued to face many financial strains over the past several years due to the payout of costly claims. This has led to continued increases in policy holder premiums, along with dramatic consolidation in recent years and fewer insurance carriers actually writing new stand-alone  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.locallifeagents.com/long-term-care-insurance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   LTC policies  </a> </u> .</p><p> Those carriers that are still issuing new policies have had to do so with higher premiums, along with fewer and / or reduced benefits.</p><p> For example, in the past, many carriers offered an Unlimited, or Lifetime benefit option. Today, that is no longer the case.</p><h3> 2. Is it cost-effective for consumers? <br/>  </h3><p> Traditional LTC insurance has become cost prohibitive for many consumers. In some cases, those who have purchased long-term care insurance policies in the past have seen their premiums double, or even triple, over the years.</p><p> However, there are other options that are available for consumers that can help them in covering long-term care needs while at the same time, also allowing them flexibility.</p><p> For example, combination life insurance / LTC products provide a death benefit along with the ability to access funds in the case of a long-term care need. Likewise, combination annuity / LTC products provide the ability to access a monthly benefit if they need long-term care.</p><p> These products can be much more cost-effective because the consumer (or their heirs) will receive a benefit either way &ndash; regardless of whether they end up requiring long-term care services or not.</p><h3> 3. Have there been any recent changes? <br/>  </h3><p> Some of the recent changes in the LTC insurance market have included:</p><p> &bull; Financial strains, leading to carrier consolidation <br/> &bull; Fewer insurers writing new stand-alone LTC policies <br/> &bull; Many insurers working with state insurance commissions to raise premium rates on current / in-force policies</p><h3> 4. What&rsquo;s driving the changes? <br/>  </h3><p> Some of the primary factors that are driving these changes include the fact that many of the carriers offering LTC insurance simply could not offer the promised level of benefits based upon the amount of premiums that were being charged. In other words, their policies were severely underpriced, based upon the amount of benefits that were ultimately being paid out. Longer life expectancies of today&rsquo;s consumer is one of the driving forces in this case.</p>",

    "content": "<p> This is a follow up on \" <a href=\"/advisor/7-things-to-do-when-starting-a-business-to-avoid-nasty-surprises\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   7 things to do when starting a business to avoid nasty surprises  </u> </a> \"</p><h3> <strong>  Am I self-employed? </strong></h3>If you start your own business by yourself, you are self-employed.  You report your income and expenses on Schedule C of the federal form 1040.<h3> <strong>  What if my friends are part of my business? </strong></h3>If you join with others, then you are in some form of general partnership, until you form a legal entity.  You are a &ldquo;small business&rdquo; or startup.<h3> <strong>  Do I need a corporation or an LLC? </strong></h3>You can incorporate or form a limited liability company, or LLC.If you form a corporation, you are shareholders and officers and report income and expenses on form 1120S, giving each shareholder a K-1 with information so they can report their share of net income on their 1040 (assuming you are an S corp., which is a pass through entity, and not a C corp., which is taxed at the corporate level).If you form an LLC, you are members and managers.  You report income and expenses on form 1065, giving members a K-1 to report their share on their 1040.<h3> <strong>  How do I decide if I need to form an entity? </strong></h3>Your decision to incur the expense to form and maintain an entity is based on<li> Whether your business has risks that insurance will not definitively cover, and</li><li> Whether you have personal assets, outside the business, to protect.</li>When you form an entity, you have to comply with state and sometimes local laws.  This includes filing annual reports and any licensing.  These are separate from filing income tax returns.<h3> <strong>  How do we know how much we make? </strong></h3>Any money you receive for the business counts as part of your revenue.  In most cases, this is all income.The big question is what amount of that income is taxable.  The follow-on question is how to reduce the taxable amount.You start by offsetting income with appropriate expenses.  Money you spend from your business usually creates deductible expenditures.  However, not every expensive is a deduction allowed by the IRS or states.<h3> <strong>  Okay, what expenses are allowed? </strong></h3>The general rule for deductible expense is anything that is &ldquo;ordinary and necessary,&rdquo; relying on<u> <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Deducting-Business-Expenses\" target=\"_blank\">  section 162 Internal Revenue Code </a></u>.<li> &ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; means you can't buy a $25,000 antique desk and claim that was a necessary office expenditure, and</li><li>  &ldquo;Necessary&rdquo; means you really need it for the business, as opposed to personal use or other reason.</li><h3> <strong>  Great, but how about some examples? </strong></h3>Some ordinary and necessary expenses you may incur include cell phone usage, if you need it for work, subscriptions to newspapers or online services, Metro cards to go to meetings, and Wi-Fi at home.If you hire someone to work for you, what you pay is a deductible expense.<li> Note that compliance with employer laws is different from the income tax rules that apply to your P&amp;L.</li><li> You may have an expense for hired services that you can deduct without being required to file 1099s.  You will need to know when you need to file and how (see hiring an attorney or CPA below).</li>Meals and entertainment expenses are a touchy item (read &ldquo;opportunity for fraud&rdquo;), so the IRS only allows 50% of what you claim.  Just like tracking auto mileage, it is good to have a calendar showing the business meetings for which you claim the expenses.<h3> <strong>  Home office </strong></h3>Home office is another touchy subject.<li> The space you claim has to be dedicated to the business.</li><li> You can&rsquo;t claim your living room or bedroom just because you have a computer and desk in it.</li><h3> <strong>  But my friend says &hellip; </strong></h3>Stop!  Don&rsquo;t get creative.  If ever you are audited by the IRS and they believe you are attempting to claim expenses that you didn't really incur or to claim expenses for you that are personal items, they will impose penalties for fraud and may seek criminal charges.  Even if you win, the time you spend responding to the IRS plus your legal bills will destroy any sense of victory.<h3> <strong>  How do I keep this all straight? </strong></h3>Remember what we said about the need to establish good bookkeeping at the very beginning of starting a business.  If you get everything right at the beginning, you will not have to change anything when you file your first income tax returns.You can use online services for some advice, rather than hiring someone.  For example, you can use software like TurboTax to prepare your tax returns &ndash; the software can prepare Schedule C from your P&amp;L.<h3> <strong>  Am I all set? </strong></h3>You should speak to an attorney or accountant early in the process.  She can help you form an entity, obtain licenses, and file notices with local and state agencies that supervise your kind of business activity.  She can also identify any other requirements you will need to meet.<strong> Now, you are a business owner!  Good luck</strong>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Last year I wrote my first book, on integrity lessons from top CEOs and leaders.  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Face-Shed-Values-Wisely/dp/163047732X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458859577&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=one+face+sarah\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ONE FACE  </a> </u>  doesn&rsquo;t hit bookstores until June 7th, but here are a few key lessons I learned while writing.</p><p> When I started the laborious and daunting process of writing about doing business without sacrificing values, I got plenty of push-back from people who absolutely believed that it can&rsquo;t be done. There&rsquo;s no way you can be wildly successful without cutting corners, they told me. I realized fairly quickly that I was going to have to come up with more credible sources than myself if I wanted to present a compelling message.</p><p> So I started searching out examples of phenomenal success in people who had reputations for staying true to their values. I got to sit down with incredible leaders like the President of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pepperdine.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pepperdine University  </a> </u> , a top casting director for  <u>  <a href=\"http://disney.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Disney  </a> </u>  &amp;  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.pixar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pixar  </a> </u> , the CEOs of  <u>  <a href=\"http://projectgravitas.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Project Gravitas  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://chipotle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Chipotle  </a> </u> , the Branding VP of  <a href=\"https://www.hamptoncreek.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Hampton Creek Foods  </u>  , </a>  the  <u>  <a href=\"http://corybergeron.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   guy  </a> </u>  who&rsquo;s sold over $100MM of product on HSN, and a former  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.orlandobowen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   linebacker  </a> </u>  from the Toronto Argonauts who survived (and forgave) brutal assault by corrupt law enforcement.</p><p> These powerhouses of experienced leadership were gracious enough to take the time to share with me their wisdom, stories, and lessons learned the hard way.</p><h3> What I learned&hellip; <br/>  </h3><p> During hours and hours of interviews and conversation, I discovered four primary common threads between these top integrity-driven leaders, regardless of their field of expertise:</p><h3> <strong>  Hire for character, not experience. </strong></h3><p> Character is what makes people trustworthy. Reliable. Teachable. Promotable. Without character, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much they already know about the job &mdash; it&rsquo;ll backfire sooner or later.</p><h3> <strong>  Think long-term legacy, not short-term win. </strong></h3><p> Make decisions based on what you will value 5 or 10 or 20 years from now. Treat customers with the type of respect that will keep them coming back for that long. Choose your partners based on their commitment to long-term excellence, too.</p><h3> <strong>  Focus on doing right. </strong></h3><p> Whenever you are faced with tough choices, choose the morally right one. There may be fallout in the short-term, but remember that you&rsquo;re not out for a quick buck. You&rsquo;re in it for the long-haul. And long-haul reputation is built by doing right.</p><h3> <strong>  Know your why. </strong></h3><p> Never lose sight of what drives you. Pursue an attitude that is constantly awareness of the transcendent purpose that motivates you to slog through the things that are less enjoyable. Fixating on the core values that drive your underlying purpose will keep you going when you want to give up.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Business school&rsquo;s books and the internet are filled with examples of industries or companies that failed to heed the winds of change and now, they no longer exist. <br/>  </h3><p> When my husband and I visited the Guinness beer factory in Dublin Ireland, I was intrigued by the story of the barrel makers (coopers) and how that was a thriving craft until cheaper methods and easier to use materials became available.</p><p> The most recent memorable example is the mortgage industry. It was booming before the Great Recession due to favorable lending terms and rates. When the financial crash came, many companies were on the brink of collapsing (Lehman did.) Individuals in the mortgage lending business also had to find ways to reinvent themselves.</p><p> Technology has already revolutionized other industries and careers (Uber, Amazon, Call Centers, etc.) How people adapted to those changes determined whether they remained relevant. The Financial Services industry is currently involved in a sea change due to technology (Robo platforms), potential legislation (DOL) and changing market demand (tech-savvy and Gen Y clients.)</p><p> Many people advocate focusing on a &ldquo;Niche&rdquo; and creating a &ldquo;differentiating&rdquo; value. Many of those ideas don&rsquo;t really involve doing anything different, other than marketing and segmentation. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, those are good ideas, but they are just versions of what Advisors are already doing.</p><p> Other people and companies are looking at Financial Advice with a different lens.

The best investment recommendations and financial plans are useless if the investor ignores that advice abandons the plan with the next &ldquo;trigger.&rdquo;</p><p> Helping them stay on the plan to achieve their goals is the best value you can provide that will differentiate you from the rest of the pack.</p><p> Most Financial Advisors were attracted to managing investments and narrowly defined their service and revenue model along those lines.

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  David Dye </u></p><h3> I&rsquo;m in trouble now. I&rsquo;m about to commit heresy.</h3>I want to address what I believe to be one of the most important aspects of your workplace leadership.In my work with thousands of business leaders across industries, geography, and over many years, I&rsquo;ve repeatedly seen people lose their influence because they don&rsquo;t address this one thing.In many leadership forums, many leadership books, and not a few social media memes, what I&rsquo;m about to say would be skewered, and yet&hellip; your credibility and influence depend on it.What is this leadership heresy? The answer is management.<h3> Why Management Is Vital to Your Leadership</h3>Your leadership depends on your credibility. You can&rsquo;t influence people if they don&rsquo;t trust you. Where does that trust come from?In large part, the foundation of that trust is your basic management competence. That&rsquo;s why Karin and I wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Winning-Well-Managers-Getting-Results---Without/dp/0814437257/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459436475&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=winning+well&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=trailblazeinc-20&amp;linkId=341d309b1e9f83b52092c9794d0c4dbf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Winning Well: A Manager&rsquo;s Guide to Getting Results Without Losing Your Soul</a>.I don&rsquo;t mean that you have to become a certified professional project manager in order to have influence. What I do mean is that if you don&rsquo;t have the basics in place, you create chaos and lose credibility with your people.Now, I understand that many leadership texts will tell you, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not good at management, hire it.&rdquo;<h3> Hogwash</h3>If you run the company, by all means, lead and then hire a good operations person to manage. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.But if you&rsquo;re like the vast majority of people with business leadership roles, the idea that you can hire someone to do your management for you is pure nonsense (and dangerous as well.)Even if you should become CEO, you are responsible to make sure these things happen. If they don&rsquo;t happen, that&rsquo;s on you.The good news is that the basics of management aren&rsquo;t difficult.<h3> Four Steps to Manage Well and Build Credibility</h3>At its most basic, management involves a few practices that are relatively simple. As the old saying goes: it&rsquo;s not hard, it&rsquo;s just hard work. When we struggle as managers, it is often because we have failed to do one of the following:<li> <strong>  Set clear expectations. </strong></li>I&rsquo;ve coached managers and team leaders in more than 2000 sessions and in 90% or more of those conversations, the problems we&rsquo;re discussing happened because expectations were not clear.It happened to me again recently. I was frustrated with my colleague&rsquo;s work, but when I stopped to think about it, I hadn&rsquo;t shared my expectations. I had my own image of what the project looked like and when it would be completed, but we&rsquo;d never discussed it.Expectations can come from many sources: the team itself, the manager, the organization. Regardless, if they are not clear, they will not be met, and I can guarantee you will be frustrated.<li> <strong>  Train and equip your team to meet the expectations. </strong></li>After clear expectations, the next pitfall is in assuming that everyone has the knowledge or skills to meet those expectations. Ensure your team members are set up for success!<li> <strong>  Reinforce expectations. </strong></li>This may sound redundant, but think about this for a moment. Every second, your mind is inundated with eleven million pieces of information. Think about how easily you can get distracted. In fact, I&rsquo;ll bet that you&rsquo;ll get distracted at least once while you read this article. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not offended &ndash; that&rsquo;s just the way we&rsquo;re built.Effective leaders and managers know that they must continually reinforce expectations and keep clear priorities in front of their team. We all need reminders from time to time about where we&rsquo;re going and why we&rsquo;re going there.If your team were a rock and roll band, reinforcing expectations is like the bass line or drum that anchors the song and keeps everyone on track.<li> <strong>  Celebrate and practice accountability. </strong></li>Accountability doesn&rsquo;t only mean discipline &ndash; real accountability celebrates our accomplishments and gives us course corrections as needed. We can easily demotivate our teams by failing to acknowledge success or by failing to hold everyone accountable.<h3> Your Turn</h3>Remember: Your leadership influence is built on a foundation of trust. As you wrestle with management challenges, I invite you to ask these four questions:<li> Are expectations clear to both parties?</li><li> Does your team have the skills and equipment to succeed?</li><li> Have you consistently reinforced the expectations?</li><li> Do you consistently practice accountability and celebration?</li>How do you ensure you take care of your management responsibilities (it&rsquo;s not hard, but can be hard work!)Be the leader you want your boss to be!",

    "content": "<h3> Many of us think that getting a job and staying employed in this economy is already an accomplishment and a reason to be thankful. <br/>  </h3><p> But what if you get a job offer even if you're not looking? You might think this is a miracle, but it's actually not.</p><p> The further you go in your career, the more professionals you will meet, and the more skills you learn to become valuable in your company. With that said, there will always be a possibility that new job opportunities will come right on your doorstep unexpectedly.</p><p> If you ever find yourself in this situation where you have to pick between your current job and another job opportunity, here are the things you should consider before you make a decision:   </p><h3> How long have you been in your present job? <br/>  </h3><p> No employee is actually expected to stay in the same job for more than five years. But still, job tenure is important. Depending on the number of years you have been in your current job as well as how frequently you have transferred in your field, it would be a smart choice to let go of a new opportunity if you still need to gain more experience in your present job.</p><h3> How satisfied are you in your job? <br/>  </h3><p> You should also take time to reflect on how you feel about your job. It's particularly important that you remember how it felt like doing your job before you got the new offer. Are you really happy? Are you challenged enough? Or you actually can't wait to have some change in your career?</p><p> You should also think about how the new job is related to your career plans. Does the new job fit your plans? If you're just excited by the thought of doing something new, you should think about how it will be a few months later when the excitement already wears off.</p><h3> What perks will you need to give up and what can you gain? <br/>  </h3><p> You should think about the benefits of the job offer you're receiving and compare them to what you're getting from your current job. You want perks that will make your job more interesting, and your life much easier. Don't forget to take into consideration the factors that can lead to your personal happiness as well.</p><h3> Will it be stable? <br/>  </h3><p> The job market we have at the moment is far from being a stable one. Although getting a job offer is a good sign that a company is doing well, there is still no guarantee that it will be in the same position for the years to come. Especially if you are currently employed in a company that has been stable for a long time already, even your personal coach would advise that you stay.</p>",

    "link": "is-your-customer-service-team-struggling-push-philosophy-over-policy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> As I travel the world and work with clients from all types of industries, they all recognize the importance of customer service and the role it plays in marketing, sales, growth and revenue. <br/>  </h3><p> As I do I continue to push my philosophy: Customer service is not a department. It&rsquo;s a philosophy to be embraced by every member of an organization, from the CEO to the most recently hired. </p><p> When asked how to go about that, the conversation always shifts to creating a culture that is customer focused. That means every decision that is made has the customer in mind. In addition, everyone in the organization understands the role they play in the overarching customer service strategy as well as the entire customer experience (CX).</p><p> The best companies create policies and procedures that are customer focused. They train their people &ndash; all of their people, not just the front line &ndash; to the culture. Many times there is a playbook that clearly explains how to handle certain situations, issues, problems and complaints. This is essential to the training. Yet, it is from this point I want to go a higher level.</p><h3> Culture is about philosophy, not policy <br/>  </h3><p> We learn a lot in training. Even our onsite trainers and online courses teach the &ldquo;how to&rdquo; in many situations. But in the end, it&rsquo;s not always about what we&rsquo;ve been taught. It&rsquo;s not about the specific techniques we learn in a role play. No, it&rsquo;s about simply doing the right thing.</p><p> Some might think this hard to teach, yet I&rsquo;ll argue that it may not be as hard as one might think.</p><h3> Here are the steps: <br/>  </h3><li> You have to have the right people to begin with. Two parts to this. First, the leadership team must create the culture. Second, you must hire people with the mindset that is in alignment with your customer focused culture.</li><li> Everyone must understand the basics. Before you can empower people to do the right thing, they have a base of knowledge to work from. Therefore, everyone must go through basic customer service training that is tied to their specific roles in the company.</li><li> Let people do the right thing on their own. You want employees to make their own decisions. Train them in the basics and include guidelines and suggestions. Share stories of how the philosophy of customer service trumps a policy. Prove that the employees don&rsquo;t have to seek out a manager for approval every time they are making a customer focused decision.</li><li> When employees do the right thing or go too far, both are teachable moments. Take advantage and give feedback to individual employees, and use these examples to teach others.</li><li> Consistently praise good decisions. This ties into the feedback just mentioned. Consistently praising good decisions removes employees&rsquo; self-imposed boundaries of what they think they can and cannot do.</li><li> Stay in alignment. Sustaining a customer focused culture is not easy. You can&rsquo;t announce it and expect it to take hold. You can&rsquo;t train everyone once and expect everything to change on a dime. Various groups within an organization will be trained more often than others, but everyone needs to be reminded on a regular basis.</li><p> While this may be an oversimplification of a process to push philosophy over policy, it makes sense. And while I believe that philosophy trumps policy, there are still boundaries, which is why it&rsquo;s important to hire the right people and train them to the philosophy. And once you&rsquo;re there, you and your customers will reap the benefit of an organization that roots themselves in a customer focused philosophy.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> We live in a society where &ldquo;Casual Friday&rdquo; has morphed into Casual Everyday. <br/>  </h3><p> Some companies have even begun a &ldquo;Formal Friday&rdquo; to target dressing professionally. As our workplaces become more casual, is our behavior following suit?</p><p> Professional presence is vital to any company getting and keeping clients. Having a professional presence can help you stand out in the crowd of emails, voicemails, business meetings and social occasions.</p><p> Poise, self-confidence and self-control make up professional presence. Follow these seven tips to establishing a professional presence:</p><h3> 1.Be Positive <br/>  </h3><p> A positive workplace increases productivity. Everyone has bad days, but taking it out on anyone at the office&mdash;be it your coworker or a customer&mdash;will produce negative responses and results. The first step to having a professional presence is to be optimistic.</p><h3> 2. Be on Time <br/>  </h3><p> Being late communicates that your time is more important than someone else&rsquo;s. Everyone is busy. Punctuality is vital to a professional presence. And if you are late, blaming the traffic, your family or your car is simply making an excuse. Apologize sincerely without excuses if you are late. Being professional means being on time.</p><h3> 3. Get Names Straight <br/>  </h3><p> If you can remember someone&rsquo;s name after only meeting them once, you will make a great impression. However, few of us have that talent. It is much better to say &ldquo;Please tell me your name again&rdquo; than to guess and call your potential client or coworker the wrong name. Calling someone by their name is courteous and professional. When sending an email, spell the name correctly.</p><h3> 4. Make Clients Feel Valued <br/>  </h3><p> Having a professional presence includes developing the ability to make others feel valued. Using the correct name is the first step. Asking your client questions communicates that you care. Everyone enjoys talking about themselves. Listen and repeat back little bits of the information they give you. And always include a smile in your conversation. When people feel valued, they are more likely to trust you and come back again.</p><h3> 5. Create Well-Written Communication <br/>  </h3><p> There is no excuse for sloppy emails or badly written business letters in a professional environment. Have someone edit written communication before it leaves your business. Spelling mistakes can be a strike against your professional presence. Avoid bad grammar. Create professional letterhead. Design a standard and clean signature for office emails. An impression will be established through your written communication. It is up to you if it will be negative or positive.</p><h3> 6. Use Etiquette and Skill on Phone Calls <br/>  </h3><p> Speak slowly and clearly. Put energy and a smile into your voice so that the warmth of it will be communicated. Be prepared by having whatever information you might need close to you. Think about what you are going to say before calling anyone. A brief and business-like phone call projects a professional presence. Finally, close your call as professionally as you began. Wait until they hang up before you do.</p><h3> 7. Dress Appropriately and Groom Well <br/>  </h3><p> Even though many companies are much more casual than they used to be, make sure you are following the dress code appropriately. Ask the human resources team for clarification if needed. Being fashionable at work does not always make for a professional presence. Being well groomed does. Good taste and fashion are not always synonymous. Follow the rules carefully.</p><p> A professional presence is one that exudes confidence. By following these seven tips, you can establish yourself as one who takes care of others and themselves in order to create a workplace environment that propels the company to success. Whether your company has Casual Friday or Formal Friday, work to make a professional presence every day.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Investopedia, Fidelity, Investment Quorum and Streamline Financial Services. What do these financial advisory sites have in common? A strong optimization and lead generation strategy.</p><p> As a Financial Advisor, you want your website to be search engine optimized so that you can be easily found by prospects. The last thing you want is to spend hours on end creating website content that goes unnoticed.</p><h3> Here are 5 ways to optimize your website&rsquo;s content through SEO (Search Engine Optimization): <br/>  </h3><li> <h3>  Add Call-to&ndash;Actions (CTAs)  <br/>    </h3></li><p> A CTA is a button, link, or text that can be used to collect important information from prospects and aid in converting them into clients. Some effective CTA&rsquo;s include:</p><li> Get Started Now</li><li> Join Free for a Month</li><li> Sign up for our monthly newsletter</li><li> Free Consultation</li><li> Download This E-Book</li><p> CTA&rsquo;s aim to push your prospects to share their information with you. This way you are able to directly communicate with them. For better results, make sure your CTA stands out.  <a href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/2015/08/24/dont-get-fooled-17-questions-to-ask-before-hiring-an-seo-company/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quicksprout </a>  does a great job with this:</p><p> <img alt=\"CTA example from Quicksprout\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CTA.png\"/></p><p>  </p><li> <h3>  Use Headlines  <br/>    </h3></li><p> Headlines are your attention grabber. If your headlines are ordinary and don&rsquo;t spark curiosity, then it is likely that traffic may be steered away from your Advisor website. The key is to use adjectives, numbers, and make bold statements. &ldquo;10 reasons to retire right now.&rdquo;</p><li> <h3>  Use a Meta Description  <br/>    </h3></li><p> Headlines grab your audience&rsquo;s attention while meta descriptions give your prospects more insights into what your webpage is all about. They provide a concise preview of a website page&rsquo;s content, and are used on search engine result pages.</p><p> Meta descriptions must be short, unique and relevant. It is beneficial to include custom meta descriptions that instill curiosity in your audience, convincing them to click on your website in their search results.</p><p>   <img alt=\"Meta Description Example - Digital Agent\" src=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DA-meta.png\"/></p><li> <h3>  Choose Keywords wisely  <br/>    </h3></li><p> As a Financial Advisor, using relevant keywords is vital to driving your target audience to your website. These keywords should not be general, broad, misleading or overused. You should use specific keywords, and use them in as many ways as possible, when relevant.  Some great areas to use your keywords would be:</p><li> Title tags</li><li> Sub-headers</li><li> Links</li><li> Alternate texts (images)</li><li> Content</li><p> The use of relevant keywords can assist in increasing Google&rsquo;s ranking when they assess your website. Use keywords appropriately and don&rsquo;t overuse them as Google may penalize you for &ldquo;keyword stuffing,&rdquo; which may decrease your ranking.  Keyword stuffing refers to when websites cram as many words as possible into a webpage&rsquo;s text without intent to provide useful information to the reader.</p><h3>    5. Optimize Images by using ALT tags <br/>  </h3><p> Researchers found that coloured visuals increase a person&rsquo;s willingness to read a piece of content by 80% ( <u>  <a href=\"http://www.office.xerox.com/latest/COLFS-02UA.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Xerox  </a> </u> ).Using images will enhance a viewer&rsquo;s experience on your website and make your pages look more appealing. With this in mind, it is vital to include alternative text tags, also known as an ALT tag. These tags are used on images with no links to provide information about the image when a viewer hovers their cursor over it. The tags help increase your SEO, overall search ranking and makes your website more accessible.</p><p> As Matt Cutts, the former head of Google&rsquo;s Web spam team once said, &ldquo;SEO is like a resume. You polish it so you have your best foot forward.&rdquo;</p>",

    "link": "whats-your-mindset-assuming-failure-or-trying-harder",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Not quite where you'd like to be? Start by checking your mindset. <br/>  </h3><p> Imagine your day didn&rsquo;t turn out quite like you planned: You got a C+ on your midterm, followed by a parking ticket on your car, then a brush-off from the friend you called for consolation.</p><p> How would you likely respond? </p><p> <strong>  Option A: </strong>  Assume you&rsquo;re a failure and that the world is out to get you. Take the day as further proof that you can&rsquo;t seem to get things right. Do nothing about it other than perhaps eat, punch your pillow, or climb into bed.</p><p> <strong>  Option B: </strong>  Decide to study harder for the next exam, look at what you did wrong and resolve to do better, pay the ticket, and chalk the day up to &ldquo;lessons learned.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re disappointed but ready to try again.</p><p> Your response may clue you into your mindset. And your mindset contributes to your entire outlook, well-being, relationships, level of success, and how you approach the world.</p><p> It also affects those around you &ndash; likely more than you realize.</p><p> I read Mindset by Carol Dweck with a parenting group a few years ago. The book prompted fascinating conversation not only about our children but also ourselves, spouses, teachers, and more.</p><p> Shortly thereafter, the book came up in a professional setting and resulted in similar conversation. Each time this book appears (and it is cited seemingly everywhere in business and self-help literature), a proverbial lightbulb seems to turn on.</p><p> The crux of Dweck&rsquo;s research is actually quite simple. She describes two types of mindsets: fixed and growth. But in its simplicity lies one of the most profound learnings you&rsquo;ll find in personal and professional growth.</p><p> If you have a fixed mindset, you likely base your success on winning, looking good, doing well. You tend to believe that qualities like intelligence and talent are innate and &ldquo;tap out&rdquo; at certain levels. If you can&rsquo;t do something well, you might assume you just don&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;gift&rdquo; for that particular activity and, as a result, may not even try it. Those with a fixed mindset tend to avoid challenge, not pay attention to feedback if it's anything less-than-stellar, and feel threatened by others&rsquo; success.</p><p> With a growth mindset, on the other hand, you believe you can improve, change, and grow. You&rsquo;re willing to try new things, and doing them poorly doesn&rsquo;t stop you from trying again; you assume that with experience and practice you will get better. In the vignette that opens this article, which Dweck uses in her mindset research, you are more likely to respond in the way described in example B than example A. Those with a growth mindset tend to welcome challenge, see effort as a way to gain mastery, learn from criticism, and become inspired by and/or learn from the success of others.</p><p> Quite a difference, eh?</p><p> Dweck offers many examples of both mindsets and how they impact our success as leaders, parents, teachers, and friends. In addition, she provides ways to enhance the growth mindset by simply changing the way we talk.</p><p> For example, think about how you praise others. If your son aces an exam, telling him &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so smart! You have such a knack for science!&rdquo; sounds nice, but can actually undercut his growth. What happens when he takes his history exam and doesn&rsquo;t do so well? He may interpret that to mean that he&rsquo;s not smart, or that he doesn&rsquo;t have a knack for history so he might as well not even try.</p><p> Far better to praise the process:  &ldquo;Great job! You must have prepared well for this exam!&rdquo; Highlighting a strategy, choice, or effort reminds them that they influence their destiny and can learn from all experiences. Such a small shift in how we communicate but, as Dweck shares with numerous examples in the book, those small changes can result in transformational results.</p><p> Every person I know who has read this book has expressed incredible insights gained. In fact, when I posted about it on Facebook while writing this article, the feedback was unanimously positive with many indicating they planned to pull out their copy and re-read it. If you lead, teach, coach, parent, or influence others, addMindset to your reading list. You will grow in self-awareness and be able to more readily help others do the same.</p><p> Fortunately, a growth mindset can be cultivated, encouraged, and modeled.</p><p> Start making growth-oriented conversation part of your routine at the dinner table or in your meetings: &ldquo;What did you learn today?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where have you put forth a strong effort this week?&rdquo; &ldquo;What mistake did you make, and what did you learn from it?&rdquo;</p><p> These types of questions emphasize learning, effort, and growth over &ldquo;winning&rdquo; and remind us of the role we play in our own success. This mindset empowers, energizes, and trickles into all facets of our lives!</p>",

    "link": "business-growing-rapidly-address-these-challenges-before-its-too-late",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Once a business has overcome the challenges faced in the startup phase it enters into another difficult period. <br/>  </h3><p> This period is earmarked as the stage in which scalability and flexibility become the most critical success factors. Rapid growth is a balancing act. Scaling at a speed beyond your company&rsquo;s capabilities can be detrimental to the business success. While scaling to slowly and you risk losing momentum and vital opportunities. As the company grows, it needs to take on relatively large number of people, which pose new talent challenges.</p><p> As the organisation scales up, the sheer growth can overwhelm organisation leaders. When increasing the size of the organisation, leaders need to focus on developing the right skills for the new positions within the company. Above this, they need to make sure there isn't a vacuum of talent leaving the organisation at this fragile time, while at the same time keeping  the company culture that has been nurtured from the beginning.</p><h3> Challenge one: Finding the right employees <br/>  </h3><p> Start ups are only as good as the teams that drive them. Building a team and scaling the people can be one of the biggest challenges a founding team faces as it grows. However, this step is essential to the survival of the company. In fact 75 percent of startups fail to give investor returns. This failure is pegged on the ability of the co-founders to build a team with the right mindset to drive the company forward. When a company is built from the ground up, it takes trust to outsource the responsibility to others. Hiring for culture is important, and cultural match is undoubtedly a factor that cannot be ignored. However, no personality fit can make up for the vacuum an empty position creates when that employee cannot fulfil their roles.</p><p> Finding employees who have the same motivation, and the same mindset as the co-founders is a difficult task. Traits that co-founder the must be on the lookout for are people who possess the ability to constantly challenge young business system, and constantly be improving and developing themselves. Having these &lsquo;out-of-the-box&rsquo; thinkers benefits the manager and the company, as it provides a diverse mindset that co-founders can lean on when faced with a challenge.  The ability to take constructive feedback well and build upon current employee and manager knowledge, nurtures an business environment whereby employees rapidly adapt to new business problems.</p><p> Github hires according to their belief that an employee's passion lies in their contribution to society. As Preston-Werner, CEO and co-founder says: &ldquo;Do they care about improving as a person? Do they believe in products? In supporting users? In making developers' lives better? In making it easier for people to work together? Are they self-motivated? Do they value communication skills? Do they appreciate the freedom to self-direct and make the best possible decision?&rdquo;</p><p> When Github started, they believed that their people didn't need managers to delegate tasks and for anyone to hold employees accountable. They believed that every employee was driven by the inherent belief that they were passionate by what they did. However, recently the company overhauled its business structure to include managers at every level. Reports have been surfacing that indicate some grumblings within the company. Employees, who were happy with the flat structure now face a system where they have to report to a teammate who used to be a colleague.</p><p> One employee reportedly said: &ldquo;The new CEO is trying to keep everyone happy by not making the hard decisions necessary of leaders.\" He's been described as someone who \"hides in conference rooms\" and who is being influenced by an inner circle.&rdquo;</p><p> As the company reaches hypergrowth - a business that sees over 65% increase value year on year - it needs a system that supports this type of growth. Bringing on board a hierarchal business approach can be good when the company needs structure, but when employees feel threatened by the impending changes, it may lead to retention issues. During a rapid growth stage, micromanagement drastically reduces the momentum teams have to grow. When the company is small everyone has to have broad range of skills to keep the product up and running. However, when the company gets bigger, it requires bringing in experts and learning to trust them.</p><h3> Challenge two: Employee Retention <br/>  </h3><p> During a rapid growth stage, employee retention can be a challenge, as many employees believe rapid growth can be a threat. A reasonably common failure for startups is to do a great job recruiting the first ten or so employees and then have many of them leave after the first 18 months. Companies build value over long periods of time, and maintaining employees from the start assist the rapid growth of the company. These employees come with the understanding and the ability to portray the purpose and the mission of the company to new employees within the organisation.</p><p> Many startups face retention issues, which result from negative attitudes felt by employees. This can include uncertainty about the future of the organization's direction, job security, perceptions of lack of leadership credibility and feelings of confusion due to lack of communication. In essence, employees often lose trust in their organisation and feel betrayed by their leadership when the company lacks a specific direction. During this delicate growth process, it's essential to keep employee turnover low because business continuity is key to realizing the benefits of scaling. There are a number of hurdles a company must overcome when employees jump ship. Financial implications can be dire, especially during the scaling process.</p><p> When employees leave, it creates a brain drain of knowledge. Taking the already pressured time from other employees to train the new employees can have long lasting effects on the company in the long run and causes the young start up to trip and stumble. What's more, employee turnover can result in loss customer relationships.</p><p> Once seen as a service so fundamental that it simply needed to exist, Twitter has since started to falter. A stream of characters was how people would find the most crucial, critical and thought-provoking stories in the moment. However, recently the company has seen its own growing pains, as employees publicly questioned the direction the ex-CEO, Dick Costolo, would be taking the company. Worryingly the company has recently lost a number of key executives as the pressures of growth and internal company dynamics have created a public crises.</p><p> In a desperate attempt to clamp down on its already hemorrhaging retention wound, Twitter has started offering payouts between $50 000 and $200 000 to current employees. These &ldquo;retention&rdquo; packages are offered in the form of restricted stock - stock of a company that is not fully transferable until certain conditions have been met - with a clause stipulating the employee remains at the company for at least six months to a year. However, very little appears to have changed in the intervening months. Reviews on the Glassdoor, show that the company is done very little in the way of rectifying its management policies. A number of the employees say that the company is &ldquo; not a happy workplace&rdquo; and one said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a very political climate&rdquo;.</p><p> Twitter, which has seen its share price fall more than 50 percent in 2015, has started refocus on its employees. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, told Vanity Fair, that &ldquo;developing and retaining top talent is critical to Twitter's business success and to rebuilding shareholder value&rdquo;.</p><p> Recruiting and retaining top talent is only a part of the scaling challenge. Once recruitment and retention strategies are implemented, it&rsquo;s up to the co-founders to hash out what the company stands for, the values and the beliefs the company wishes to portray. How to communicate these core fundamentals is determined by the culture these authors create.</p><h3> Challenge three: Maintaining culture <br/>  </h3><p> Good startup executives keep their fingers on the pulse of the finances and business mechanics of their companies. They are always seeking growth, developing an exit strategy, and working to increase their market share. While these are critical to a startup&rsquo;s longevity, equally crucial is internal stability, and a motivated and productive workforce. Rapid growth can yield profit and investment wins, but in the startup world, extremely fast growth can lead to structural problems if the corporate culture fails to grow at the same pace. According to  <a href=\"http://thepulseofit.com/en-us/article/how-smbs-can-maintain-company-culture-during-rapid-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Deloitte </a> , 87 percent of SMBs rated company culture and employee engagement as important or very important, yet 59 percent felt they weren't culturally ready.</p><p> Company culture is an emergent quality of the communication style and practices of the people in the organisation. Culture usually stems from the co-founders of the company, and grows out from there. As new people join the company, they embrace this culture that is nurtured from day one. Once a company grows to a level in which people have less time for each other, it becomes more difficult to maintain the core values and beliefs the company was built. For example, if people are brought on specifically for their skills set, it will naturally dilute the culture. It&rsquo;s typically around the twenty person mark that founders start feeling some concern about their company culture and how to go about maintaining what they love about the culture while the company continues to scale. Setting the mission, vision and core values become a priority, as a company with a lack of culture focus, can end up losing steam during its scaling period.</p><p> Startups that establish and cheerlead core values to maintain stability for their teams and maintain focus on the core mission, enjoy long term success. In a recent Bersin study, it found that companies who focused on their culture are 80 percent more likely to have engaged employees. Darius John Mirshahzadeh, President of the Endeavor America Loan Services believes that once employees are hired, they adopt the values of the company immediately. By implementing daily and weekly, &ldquo;Huddles&rdquo;, the company ensures its people constantly remain on the same page.  In addition to this, the company makes use of incentive and reward software, to make sure everyone is recognised for the work they do.  And this level of culture commitment is showing, as the company has over 90 percent overall retention rates, and continues to add employees and offices that are in sync with each other.</p><p> It&rsquo;s important to accept there is no one size fits all culture for startups. If the person in the team doesn't fit, then the co-founders should make the decision about who stays and who goes. Win Cramer, president and Founder of Jlab Audio, says that there is nothing more problematic to the culture of fast growth then a person that just doesn&rsquo;t fit in.</p><p> Recently, Zenefits, has had its fair share of news headlines. The company offers cloud HR management software and makes most of its money selling HR-related benefits. It was this unique business model that sent the company into a rapid cycle of growth. In its first two years of operating, the company reached a $4.5 billion in valuation. However, of late, the company has seen its CEO step down, and the company lay off 250 employees. David Sacks, the new CEO, issued a statement, stating &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no secret that zenefits grew too fast, stretching both our culture and our control&rdquo;</p><p> The company, which was labeled as the fastest growing subscription software business in Silicon Valley, had a culture that oozed a frat like ideologies of drinking, smoking and having sex in inappropriate places (such as company stairwells). However, the culture soon came under scrutiny. Zenefits was investigated for allegedly allowing insurance brokers to cut short mandatory requirements to obtain a license, so they could join the Zenefits ecosystem quicker. Following this, Sacks made a statement that said: &ldquo;Our culture and tone have been inappropriate for a highly regulated company [...] we must have integrity in the way we treat each other and must make zenefits a great place to work for employees, because we&rsquo;re all in this together.&rdquo;</p><p> When companies grow quickly, it&rsquo;s a challenge to keep the culture in check. In Zenefits case, the focus was on output, which saw the culture fall behind. In some cases, it's vital that the company culture reflect the industry in which the business operates in. As in this case, insurance is a highly regulated and highly bureaucratic system, and not having certain aspects that reflect these aspects can hurt the company. By realigning the company culture to reflect a highly moderated industry, David Sacks realised that there was a need to reign in some of the detrimental aspects the company culture had on the growth of the business.</p><p> Company culture is a hot topic in today's business world, and getting it right is imperative to the long term success of the business. When co-founders understand the true values and beliefs that drive the company, its easier to employ people who have the same beliefs. Today, employees have more bargaining power and are free to jump ship whenever they feel the company does not live up to their expectations.</p><h3> Solution: Impraise <br/>  </h3><p> Rapid Growth comes with a series of challenges a company must face in order to be successful. When a company goes through this stage, it must clearly define and understand what roles they require and the employee they need. A good way to do this is to implement a performance review process, such as the platform  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.impraise.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Impraise  </a> </u>  offers, from the beginning to understand the key strengths and weaknesses of each stakeholder in the company.</p><p> From here, the co-founders can easily determine which skills to hire for and which employees would be best suited to the culture. Once these employees are successfully integrated into the culture of the organisation, a company can open up the channels of communication to better help employees understand how the business is developing and where each employees can help to get better business results. Manager reviews can give employees direct oversight of how they see their manager performing. Implementing this can gives managers to fully understand how they are developing their skills as leaders and rectify any issues that might occur quickly and continuously.</p>",

    "link": "4-steps-to-be-well-on-your-way-to-your-own-spring-cleaning-bliss",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Ah, spring. For most of us, it&rsquo;s an energizing time when we feel motivated to clean out, clean up, and start fresh. <br/>  </h3><p> Even with that motivational spirit, I confess that I have a love-hate relationship with spring cleaning. I dread the thought of it. I procrastinate diving into it. But the moment I get started, I begin to feel that sense of rejuvenation (my favorite task: cleaning the garage floor&mdash;and even painting it this year!).</p><p> When it&rsquo;s all done, I absolutely bask in having a clean garage again. To walk into that space knowing everything is clean, organized, and efficient is pure spring bliss, and I&rsquo;m ready to move on the garden and planting the spring flowers.</p><p> So while you&rsquo;re full of all that spring energy, I urge you to set aside just an hour or two to focus on spring cleaning to simplify your finances. It&rsquo;s a job that most of us neglect year after year. That feeling of accomplishment and organizational bliss may be that much easier to achieve. No broom needed!</p><p> Follow these four steps and you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to your own spring cleaning bliss:</p><h3> 1. Shred documents you don&rsquo;t need <br/>  </h3><p> While the IRS has a standard period of limitations of three years, we recommend holding on to your key documents for 7 years to cover all your bases. Ask your tax preparer for an electronic copy of your return and save it on a flash drive or at a secure online file hosting service such as  <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Drop Box </a> . Not only will you need this information in case of an audit, but your financial advisor may request a copy of your return to review it for mistakes (we find at least one error in over 50% of the returns we review) and determine the most appropriate withholding on your IRA withdrawals. Feel free to toss all those old bank statements and check registers in the shredder too. The less unneeded paper you have on hand, the more easily you can find the important stuff.</p><h3> 2. Organize documents you do need <br/>  </h3><p> If your financial documents are a mess, your financial life can feel pretty messy too. And tax documents aren&rsquo;t the only important papers you need to track. Some people prefer to save things in paper form using a file cabinet. Others prefer to maintain everything they can electronically. Whatever your preference, set up a system so you can easily store and retrieve information, including:</p><p> <strong>  Personal identification and documents related to major life events: </strong> Be sure your passports; security cards; marriage, divorce, and birth certificates; car titles; wills; and other important documents are safe and accessible at home or in a safe deposit box at your bank.</p><p> <strong>  Bank statements: </strong> Start by consolidating accounts, updating your bill pay service, and shredding old paper statements. Most banks offer online access to statements for more than 12 months, so there&rsquo;s rarely a need to fill your files with paper statements. But be sure you know how to access up to 3 years of statements in case of a tax audit.</p><p> <strong>  Investment account statements: </strong> If you have multiple retirement or other investment accounts, be sure you have a complete list of your accounts, including login information if your accounts are online. (Be sure to share this with your financial advisor to be sure he or she has the most current and complete information.)</p><p> <strong>  Tax documents: </strong> Keep and file W-2s, 1099s, brokerage tax forms, interest receipts, and receipts for deductibles until they hit that 7-year expiration date. </p><h3> 3. Plan your spending for the coming year <br/>  </h3><p> Even if you have a good emergency fund in place, planning for and prioritizing expenditures can help keep your budget healthy all year round.</p><p> Create a budget. A recent Gallup poll revealed that two-thirds of Americans don&rsquo;t have a household budget. So you&rsquo;re not alone if this has slipped through the cracks. Figure out how much is available to spend on your wish list after your basic expenses are covered, set your priorities, and be sure you&rsquo;re not spending beyond your means.</p><p> Reduce debt. If you&rsquo;ve racked up some debt in the past year (or more), make paying it down a top priority. Zero consumer debt is a great goal and one of the best rewards spring cleaning can offer.</p><p> Home maintenance projects. These can add up to big dollar signs, so planning is key. Start with deferred maintenance projects like cleaning out gutters, mending that fence, or exterior painting. And be sure to plan for large projects like a new roof or kitchen remodel. Good planning can help keep you on budget. And talk to your financial advisor if you need to leverage a HELOC or other source to fund the project.</p><h3> 4. Update your estate planning documents <br/>  </h3><p> Keeping these documents current is often (and easily) neglected, so it&rsquo;s a great item to include in your spring cleaning list. Check to be sure your beneficiaries are correct (I can&rsquo;t tell you how many divorcees forget to make this change!). Be sure your fiduciaries (Executor, Trustee, or Health Care POA) know where they can find important documents. Complete a Personal Property Memorandum to indicate which of your heirs should receive your car, family photo albums, grandma&rsquo;s china, and more. Lastly, send a copy of your will to your financial advisor so it&rsquo;s available when needed.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re overwhelmed, take one step at a time. If that doesn&rsquo;t do the trick, get some help. When my aunt moved into assisted living and I was taking care of her finances, I hired a group who completely cleaned out the house, including sending me her financial documents and arranging an estate sale to dispose of the remainder of her household even though I was thousands of miles away. If you don&rsquo;t know where or how to get help, ask your financial advisor for guidance. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t let the mess continue to grow. Make financial spring cleaning a priority and enjoy the delights of spring.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> What does it take for you to get over your self-consciousness and let go? <br/>  </h3><p> Do you stay in your shell or are you willing to poke out your head if the price is right? Maybe you&rsquo;re a natural extrovert, and it takes a lot for you to feel self-conscious. No matter what, we all have (comfort zone) lines in the sand, and it&rsquo;s important to know yours.</p><p> Crossing your line is a good thing when you&rsquo;re pulled forward by something that matters and not because you&rsquo;re pushed. </p><p> This week my family and I are on vacation at the beach. I&rsquo;m doing my best to breathe in the serenity of the sea daily so I can carry it with me in the coming months. There are few places on earth that make me feel as peaceful as the beautiful beaches in Western Australia. It&rsquo;s worth the three-plus hour flight and the three-hour drive to the beach house, aka heaven.</p><p> Usually, when we arrive, I&rsquo;m still a stressed out small business owner and parent to two tweens who are slightly less patient than I should be. I admit it. (and don&rsquo;t ask my kids or husband to define slightly) Midway through the holiday, I nap more, read more, dig my feet in the sand more and finally unwind. The fact that we visit our share of cellar doors also helps.</p><h3> Welcome to the Discomfort Zone <br/>  </h3><p> When we landed in Perth, like most people who get off of a long flight, we made the trek to the toilets. Waiting outside of the restroom for the boys, my daughter and I were hanging out, and I gave her a dare: I want to see you dance, full out, for 60 seconds.</p><p> She thought I was nuts.</p><p> I encouraged her, told her nobody was watching (although they would be in a minute or two).</p><p> She&rsquo;s an introvert and despite the fact that she loves dancing, that does not include dancing, without music, in front of strangers at the airport.</p><p> I dared her again.</p><p> She moved her shoulder to a beat that only she could hear and giggled.</p><p> I dared her again.</p><p> No!</p><p> <strong>  What if&hellip; </strong></p><p> She is in the midst of a giving project. For 30 days, instead of allowance for chores, she gets $5 for every chore she does without being asked (or assigned), $5 for every hour of reading and $5 for an hour of math practice. At the end of 30 days, she&rsquo;s going to pick a classroom through  <u>  Donors Choose </u>  and donate her earnings. Her goal is a minimum of $200.</p><p> <strong>  What if&hellip; </strong></p><p> &ldquo;If you do it full out for 60 seconds, I&rsquo;ll give you $5 towards your project,&rdquo; I offered.</p><p> Without hesitation, she was grooving, smiling, and earning.</p><p> When her brother and father walked out of the restroom, she kept dancing. They looked at her a little funny, but she wasn&rsquo;t about to let looking silly get in her way. Done.</p><p> My self-conscious soon-to-be teen stopped dancing, but our smiles continued.</p><h3> When Will You Step Over the Edge of Your Discomfort Zone Into the Unknown? <br/>  </h3><p> Over the years, I&rsquo;ve coached small business owners and large business leaders stuck in their own heads. They worried about people&rsquo;s judgements, as they watched them stretch and potentially fail. They feared how other people would scrutinize them, so they held back. Sound familiar?</p><p> Life is too short to hold back. When you give less than your all, you get less too.</p><p> <strong>  What if&hellip; </strong></p><p> Instead of pushing yourself to make a leap that&rsquo;s too great, you set a smaller increment where you feel the stretch. Do it and you&rsquo;ll discover that your next step is closer than you think. What&rsquo;s your $5?</p><p> How far are you willing to go into your discomfort zone for something that matters? What will it take for you to make the leap?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The world of business is in constant motion. <br/>  </h3><p> Clients' needs evolve. New competitors emerge. Regulators rewrite the rules. And, of course, technology changes everything. Every few years, transformations in the marketplace compel professional services firms to reassess their place in the universe and adjust to a new reality.</p><p> Rebranding is an ideal way to address these challenges: realigning companies with fundamental changes in the marketplace and revealing new paths to grow your professional services firm. Let&rsquo;s step you through a tried-and-true process of self-assessment and re-adjustment, so you can recalibrate and reenergize your firm's brand. </p><h3> When Rebranding Makes Sense <br/>  </h3><p> Before you dive into rebranding your firm, ask yourself the following questions:</p><li> Are you are getting fewer leads than in the past?</li><li> Are you are entering a new market?</li><li> Are you are introducing significant new services?</li><li> Has your firm's growth slowed or stopped?</li><li> Have new competitors entered the marketplace?</li><li> Does your visual brand look tired compared to the competition?</li><li> Do you struggle to describe how your firm is different?</li><li> Are you losing a higher percentage of competitive bid situations than in the past?</li><li> Has your firm changed since you last adjusted your brand?</li><li> Are you struggling to attract top talent?</li><li> Are competitors hiring away valuable employees?</li><li> Are you trying to figure out how to take your firm to the next level?</li><p> If you answered yes to any of these questions, it may be time to take a hard look at your brand. Your brand may be doing more harm than good.</p><h3> A Rebranding Process That Works <br/>  </h3><p> Branding firms take a variety of approaches to the rebranding process. They may invoke proprietary terminology and complicated models. But when you get past the rhetoric, most serious firms use some variation of the process below. They use it (as we do) because it works. Let's take a look. In plain language.</p><p> <strong>  Phase 1: Get the Strategy Right </strong></p><p> As tempting as it may be, don't jump into the visual side of branding (logo, colors, website, etc.) without doing the due diligence first. You'll need to do some research to understand where the market opportunities lie and what changes you need to make to make the most of them. Your branding partner will likely want to research some or all of the following key areas:</p><li> Internal staff&mdash;Your firm's management team and staff provide an internal perspective on your brand. This is particularly useful (and eye opening) when compared to the perceptions of external audiences.</li><li> Current clients&mdash;Existing clients will help you understand your strengths and weaknesses. Use this information to improve operations and client communications.</li><li> Former clients&mdash;Former clients can offer clues to building more lasting relationships. They can also illuminate weaknesses that you never knew existed.</li><li> Prospects&mdash;Prospective clients in your target audience will help you get a handle on your awareness in the marketplace, how you stack up against the competition and valuable general perceptions about your company and current brand.</li><li> Lost prospects&mdash;Nobody will provide better insight into your perceived weaknesses in the marketplace than these folks.</li><li> Community leaders&mdash;In some industries (such as A/E/C and government contracting), community leaders can be powerful influencers. They can provide a valuable perspective on a firm's perceived strengths and weaknesses and point out missed opportunities.</li><li> Competitors&mdash;If you truly know your competition, you know how to succeed. Learn where opportunities exist to differentiate you firm, how to speak with more clarity and how to build competitive advantage.</li><p> For items 1&ndash;6, you'll need to conduct qualitative phone or in-person interviews. If you want to receive honest answers to your questions, however, be sure to employ an impartial third party to conduct the interviews, preferably an individual or firm that can handle the calls with skill and professionalism.</p><p> Competitive research can typically be conducted online by reviewing websites of key competitors. What constitutes a \"key competitor,\" however, can be tricky to determine. Our own research into professional services firm buyers has shown that there is surprisingly little overlap between the firms you think are your competitors and firms your clients name as your competitors. Once you've drawn up a reasonably accurate list of competitors, you'll want to collect brand-relevant data on each, such as their logos, brand colors, taglines, key messages, key service offerings and visual stylistic characteristics.</p><p> Your branding partner will analyze this body of research and develop these deliverables:</p><li> Brand positioning statement&mdash;This brief paragraph describes your unique sales proposition, differentiation attributes and market positioning. Ideally, this statement is intended for internal use and subsequent marketing message development.</li><li> Key differentiators&mdash;A list of the characteristics that set your firm apart from otherwise similar firms in the marketplace (especially your key competitors).</li><li> Messaging architecture&mdash;This document identifies your target audiences and provides customized messages to each. In addition, the architecture document presents potential barriers each audience may raise when considering your firm, as well as responses to overcome each barrier. This document will become an invaluable resource to many people in your firm&mdash;from sales staff to marketing copywriters.</li><p> Some branding firms will add a fourth deliverable at this stage&mdash;a visual expression of your brand, which provides a sneak peak at your visual brand.</p><p> Once you and your branding partner have finalized the deliverables, you are ready to take this brand platform and begin the building process.</p><p> <strong>  Phase 2: Build the Brand </strong></p><p> When most people talk about branding, this is the phase they mean&mdash;logos, colors, typography, design. It's exciting to see a new brand literally taking shape before your eyes. Just remember to stop periodically and check your progress against the roadmap documents you produced in Phase 1. Make sure the materials developed by your branding or design firm are reflecting your differentiators (is that photo of a handshake really setting your apart from your competitors?) and your market positioning.</p><p> Build out your brand in a logical order. If you are considering a name change, for instance, do that first. Everything builds in one way or another on your business' name. Your logo and tagline are the next logical steps. From there, you can go in many directions: stationery, website, brochures, PowerPoint template, sales sheets, proposal formats&mdash;the sky's the limit!</p><p> At some point, however, you may want to reign in your visual brand (also called your \"brand identity\"), impose some limits and protect your investment. Ask you branding firm to develop a set of brand style guidelines. These guidelines, which can range from a single sheet to hundreds of densely-packed pages, ensure consistency across all your visual communications. They lay down the law regarding logo usage, typeface options, color palette, image style&mdash;some go into exhaustive detail about grid layouts and other arcane aspects of design. For most firms, a modest document of 10 to 25 pages is usually sufficient.</p><p> <strong>  Phase 3: Roll Out the Brand </strong></p><p> Launching a new brand has many implications and dimensions. If your firm employs more than a handful of people, you'll want to develop and implement a brand rollout plan. This plan may address educating staff on the importance of your new brand and its salient features. The plan might include a launch announcement to clients, partners, referral sources, media and prospects. Keep in mind that a brand launch is a rare opportunity to command attention in the marketplace and make a statement. You'll want to make the most of it.</p><h3> What to Expect from Rebranding <br/>  </h3><p> If you are still on the fence about investing in a rebranding effort, consider this: people make real purchasing decisions based on perceptions. The more you can influence those perceptions in a positive way, the better off your firm will be. Buyers of professional services may take weeks or months to decide amongst a pool of qualified firms, but they can eliminate a firm in just seconds. All it takes is a weak brand or ineffectual message.</p><p> Most firms we work with witness three immediate positive benefits following a rebranding:</p><li> Improved focus&mdash;Management and staff really understand&mdash;often for the first time&mdash;what their firm stands for and where its priorities lie. Everyone in the organization is in alignment and working toward common goals.</li><li> Competitive advantage&mdash;Firms become more relevant to prospects because they are better able to fill a need in the marketplace. In addition, negatives associated with an outdated brand have been eliminated, providing an instant credibility boost.</li><li> Confidence&mdash;Employees feel more confident in their firm's future prospects. They know how to talk about their firm and no longer need to apologize for their creaky old website or awkward name.</li><p> Rebranding, if carried out in a thorough and thoughtful way, can play out in many wonderful ways over the long term, as well: improved awareness, stronger recruiting, better lead generation and increased revenues. If your professional services firm is considering rebranding, take the time to do it the right way. The payoff will be tremendous.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Taxalicious /taks-a-li-shus/ Adjective. Definition: Feeling or showing pleasure or contentment from being ultra-prepared for the Federal tax filing deadline. <br/>  </h3><p> I would not be shocked if my CPA decided to send me a box of chocolates this week. Surprisingly, I made it to his top 10 for having copies of all my tax records in early, before the April 18 (not a typo) deadline. Being well-prepared and ahead of schedule this tax season feels great, so great, I have decided to give it a name: taxalicious!</p><p> With Monday, April 18, 2016 approaching, there is still time to get started, gather your receipts, W-2s, 1098s, 1099s, basically everything but the kitchen sink for your tax preparer. Who knows, you might even receive your own box of chocolates &lt;I&rsquo;m kidding of course&gt; from these taxalicious tax tips: </p><h3> 1. Mark important tax deadlines on your calendar <br/>  </h3><p> This may seem obvious but I guarantee a small percentage of American taxpayers believe Tax Day is April 15, which it is NOT for 2016. Actually, the tax filing deadlines for filing both Federal Tax Returns (Form 1040) and a Federal Tax Extension (Form 4868) for Tax Year 2015 is Monday, April 18, 2016. This is due to an overlap of tax deadlines and Federal/State holidays. State tax deadlines also vary from state to state, and some states, like Texas and Florida, do not have a state income tax at all. Not sure about the tax deadline in your state? You can find a complete  <a href=\"http://www.efile.com/tax-day-deadlines/#table\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Federal and State table a Countdown Clock on efile.com </a> . Another important tax date you&rsquo;ll want to mark on your calendar is Monday, October 17, 2016 &ndash; the last day to file a 2015 Federal Income Tax Return for Tax Extension filers. <br/>  </p><h3> 2. Choose a tax preparer wisely <br/>  </h3><p> While a majority of tax preparers are honest, the IRS sees many taxpayers suffer financially because they made a poor choice of tax preparer. For tax preparers you may be considering, the IRS recommends asking about their qualifications, training, certification, and professional licenses. Not every tax preparer is equal in the eyes of the IRS. Only an Enrolled Agent, Certified Public Accountant (CPA), or Attorney have unlimited representation rights and can represent you before the IRS in all matters &ndash; audits, collections, and appeals. The IRS also recommends you only work with tax preparers that offer IRS e-file, signs their name to your return, and enters a final PTIN &ndash; Preparer Tax Identification Number on your tax return. Stay away from any tax preparer promising you a big refund. This should be a major red flag. Finally, the IRS has an  <u>  <a href=\"http://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf\" target=\"_blank\">   online directory  </a> </u>  to help you research tax preparers which includes those that have a professional credential, voluntarily take continuing education, and hold an Annual Filing Season Program Record of Completion. <br/>  </p><h3> 3. You are legally responsible for what&rsquo;s on your tax return <br/>  </h3><p> The fact is even if you pay someone else to prepare your Federal Tax return, you are legally responsible for any errors or mistakes on that return. For example, failure to report all the income you have received during the year, not just wages, is illegal and may result in substantial penalties. Sources of additional income include things like freelance income, interest, dividends, sale of property, and even temporarily renting out your entire home or a room in your house for more than 14 days through rental services such as Airbnb, HomeAway, or VRBO. Keep in mind the IRS receives a copy of every 1099 form, so they know exactly how much money taxpayers receive. It is equally important to check any 1099 report you get for accuracy and open each piece of mail carefully. Sometimes, there are discrepancies whereby a taxpayer may receive two different versions of the same form, example 1099-R (Distribution from Pension, Annuities, Retirement or Profit Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.) from a custodian and an employer. Your tax preparer should have all copies but in the event of an unintentional mistake, the IRS allows taxpayers to file amended returns for up to the three years after the original due date of the return. <br/>  </p><h3> 4. Plan ahead if you need copies of previous tax returns <br/>  </h3><p> A computer printout of your return information is called a transcript, and is available by mail through the IRS.gov website. This transcript is not a photocopy of your actual return but rather shows the basic data including return type, marital status, adjusted gross income, taxable income, credits and payments. The IRS offers several transcript types, in English and Spanish, free of charge for the current tax year and three prior processing years directly on IRS.gov, using Form 4506-T &ndash; Request for Transcript of Tax Return. Transcripts arrive in 5 to 10 calendar days at the address they have on file for you so plan ahead, especially if you have changed your home address, which will add another four to six weeks to process your request. If you need a copy of your actual return, including attachments, you must file Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return. <br/>  </p><h3> 5. Download the mobile app to make a payment or check a refund <br/>  </h3><p> (IMPORTANT NOTE: NEVER USE A PUBLIC WIFI, FREE INTERNET, OR A PUBLIC COMPUTER TO MAKE A PAYMENT OR CHECK ON THE STATUS OF A REFUND WITH THE IRS2GO APP OR WHERE&rsquo;S MY REFUND DESKTOP PRODUCT). Want a quick, easy, and secure way to check on the status of your refund or make a payment? You can now download the IRS2Go mobile app on your smartphone. The app itself is free to use for taxpayers wanting to check the status on a refund, 24 hours after e-file and 4 weeks after mailing a paper return. There is also a desktop version called &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Refund.&rdquo; In either case, you&rsquo;ll need to plug in a social security, filing status, and exact refund amount to retrieve your personalized refund date. If, on the other hand, you need to make a payment to the IRS, the IRS2Go App provides several payment methods to pay directly from your bank account or with your debit and credit card. Paying by credit card vs the direct pay method is the most expensive option, since it uses one of three approved payment processors; each charges a flat fee about $2.50 plus a credit card fee near 2%. Remember, to avoid penalties and interest, you must pay what you owe by your due date, even if you apply for an extension! <br/>  </p><h3> 6. Have your guard up <br/>  </h3><p> The IRS does not have your number and is not calling you! Last week, the IRS released a new  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Consumer-Alert-Scammers-Change-Tactics-Once-Again\" target=\"_blank\">   CONSUMER ALERT: SCAMMERS CHANGE TACTICS, ONCE AGAIN  </a> </u>  about nicey-nice scam artists posing as IRS agents, calling to verify tax return information over the phone, getting you to release personal information such as social security and bank account numbers. This particular scam is a big contrast from the aggressive, argumentative tactic demanding money most of us have heard. But that&rsquo;s not all. Just this year, the IRS has seen a 400% increase in phishing schemes over email that use creative subject lines such as &ldquo;The IRS has a refund waiting for you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Complete your tax return information.&rdquo; Do NOT reply or open any attachments in these bogus emails or text messages. Instead, report it immediately to the IRS to phishing@irs.gov. Additionally, be sure to visit IRS.gov regularly and follow them on Twitter @IRSNews to stay on top of the latest news, consumer alerts, and releases from the IRS.</p><h3> A FINAL NOTE: <br/>  </h3><p> Being taxalicious does not replace the need to seek personalized tax advice from your tax preparer, accountant, and financial advisor who know the most important details of your financial life including your marriage, children, income, investments and social security numbers. You should always seek out the expertise of a licensed tax professional for tax guidance.</p>",

And it&rsquo;s easy to jump right in and start executing.</p><p> Without industry insight, however, what do you really have to guide your execution other than guesses and assumptions?</p><p> Sarah Cox in her report, &ldquo;Social Media Marketing in a Small Business: A Case Study&rdquo;, states that far too many small business owners execute tactics without having a solid strategy:</p><p>  &ldquo;&hellip;one in five small businesses have no social media strategy. Without strategy or goals, a business is unable to determine whether or not they are gaining anything through their efforts, or simply wasting time. \"</p><p> \"Those businesses without a strategy also reported being less satisfied with social media&rsquo;s ability to generate new leads (SMB Group, 2012). Small businesses need to have a plan when using social media.&rdquo;</p><p> I don&rsquo;t know about you but the last thing I want to do is spend my time and money on guesses. That&rsquo;s why whenever I start a new campaign, I ensure I&rsquo;m prepped with ample industry insight.</p><p> This post is here to give you a few of the processes I&rsquo;ve uncovered to accomplish just that.</p><h3> Getting Started with Industry Analysis: <br/>  </h3><p> Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t just log into our competitors reporting accounts and get access to what&rsquo;s working (and what isn&rsquo;t). As such, quantitative research on our industry isn&rsquo;t really the easiest to do.</p><p> That&rsquo;s where the real power of qualitative research comes to play.</p><p> Just so happens that reasons, opinions, and motivations are the very things industry insight aims to learn more about.</p><p> Michael Porter in &ldquo;Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors&rdquo; advises a 4-pillar framework for analyzing competitors, aimed at discovering:</p><li> objectives</li><li> assumptions</li><li> strategy</li><li> capabilities</li><p> Thinking of these four pillars when performing industry research helps you better frame what competitors are doing, why, and the resources needed to execute.</p><p> Seeing, for example, that your top competitor highlights the benefit of &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; could make you assume that this benefit is what works. Drawing a conclusion solely on this one competitor and one benefit featured, however, is dangerous.</p><p> By looking at their four pillars, we can get more insight into why they used that benefit.</p><p> Was it out of mere convenience or habit? Or was it a more strategic approach aligned with a history of using that same benefit? AKA, is the benefit &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; a key selling point that built their business and, as such, is one they continue to reinforce?</p><p> If that&rsquo;s the case, do you want to compete against those strong foundations? Or is it better to differentiate yourself and focus on another benefit?</p><p> While we won&rsquo;t know the cold, hard numbers of a competitor&rsquo;s ad campaign or email series, knowing what they executed and why provides ample information.</p><p> If you&rsquo;ve studied anything about animal and human behavior, there&rsquo;s one frequently repeating concept: \" Nature is a procession of the environment.\"</p><p> What our competitors proactively engage in (and how they execute) are all symbols of a response to the environment (their audience).</p><p> If your competitor has stumbled upon a certain appeal or angle that works, they&rsquo;ll likely repeat it.</p><h3> The gold is in their timeline of behaviors <br/>  </h3><p> By seeing what competitors have historically used to promote their services, you can get a strong picture of what messaging has worked and what hasn&rsquo;t.</p><p> Clearly, a sales appeal that tanks will disappear quickly (assuming the company is savvy and results-driven).</p><p> Nevertheless, there are other ways to gauge an appeals power:  <strong>  popularity </strong> <strong>  . </strong></p><p> The fact is that our world is highly saturated by competitors and marketers in every industry where money is available.</p><p> As such, if you find a sales benefit or feature highlighted by one competitor but none of the others, there are often two reasons:</p><li> The pitch is focused on a minor appeal that may not resonate with many</li><li> You&rsquo;ve found a hidden gem you can use to win over consumers</li><p> This hidden gem is what we always aim to look for. It&rsquo;s how we can find an easy way to compete in the industry without resorting to a bigger ad budget or higher lifetime customer value than our competitors.</p><p> While we may get lucky finding a hidden gem through historic campaigns our competitors have engaged in, that&rsquo;s just one approach</p><h3> Consumer Behavior + Competitive Behavior = Industry Insight <br/>  </h3><p> To amp up our chances for striking gold, we&rsquo;re going to want to research not only our competitors but our target audience as well.</p><p> <strong>  Consumer behavior is shaped by primarily two things: </strong></p><li> What consumers desire, want, need</li><li> What competitors are presenting to consumers</li><p> No doubt about it, your competitors behavior and communication influence how your prospects interact on the internet.</p><p> Their search queries, preferences for purchase, etc are all stemmed from actions they took with prior competitors.</p><p> For this reason, assimilating as much insight into what your target consumers respond to is vital.</p><p> When it comes to digital marketing, for example, most everyone knows SEO as SEO. Highly advanced SEO practitioners engaging in schema, however, use a rather different terminology to describe their approaches.</p><p> As such, you can expect a blog post titled &ldquo;The Semantic Web &amp; Emergent SEO&rdquo; to garner little response. Compare that with Neil Patel&rsquo;s post, &ldquo;Demystifying SEO: How to Skyrocket Your Traffic Through Schema Markup&rdquo; and you have a post that&rsquo;s much more approachable to the typical SEO audience.</p><p> I can guarantee Neil knows a ton about Schema and advanced SEO. But he also knows that the goal of his post is to generate publicity and links, NOT to share advanced topics for personal pleasure in a way that alienates 95% of his readers.</p><p> It&rsquo;s about your audience, not you.</p><p> So how do you go about getting more insight into what your audience responds to?  Here&rsquo;s a quick-start list:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Check Out Your Competitors Website </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> You can tell a lot about an industry from how your competitors structure and set up their website.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not just referring to SEO optimization and keywords.</p><p> What are the key messages and call-to-actions placed on the homepage? How is the top navigation arranged? What are the links placed in this menu?</p><p> How is the blog section set up? Is there a section for visitors to enter their email address? If so, what is the headline and copy used to entice visitors? Also, what categories are used in the blog?</p><p> The answer to all of these questions reveal a carefully thought out series of decisions your competitors made.</p><p> I recommend setting up an excel sheet with rows and columns and documenting just what you find through this process for each of your competitors.</p><p> Now here&rsquo;s where the common mistake comes that most fall for.</p><p> They carefully analyze the way competitors set up their website. Then, after brainstorming and wireframing, they come up with a prototype that combines what they feel were the best ideas along with their own contributions from experience.  See the problem?</p><p> This process is simply using your competitors decisions as your research. What about your consumers behavior? What about the thought processes your competitors made to reach those decisions?</p><p> By basing your decision off your competitors decisions, you&rsquo;re side-stepping an important practice to success: critical thinking and analysis of why these decisions were made.</p><p> This is an all too common trap us digital marketers fall for.</p><p> We copy competitors we see as successful without arming ourselves with enough audience insight.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why the next process is golden&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  2. Online Sales and Interaction Sites </strong></h3><p>  </p><p> While we don&rsquo;t have access to our competitors email and ad campaign metrics, we do have something else: online super stores and social discussion sites.</p><p> These sites give clear indicators of what content and appeals resonate most with audiences. What&rsquo;s more, often times many hidden gems can be found that your competitors have yet to mine.</p><p> <strong>  Amazon: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"amazon-screenshot\" height=\"269\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/amazon-screenshot.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> If you have a strong focus on content marketing, ebooks, or whitepapers, Amazon is a great source of valuable insight.</p><p> Whatever industry you work for, I can guarantee there are books on the subject available at Amazon. As such, each of these books have a few key things:</p><li> A book title</li><li> Number of reviews</li><li> Sales ranking and popularity</li><p> By analyzing your niches top selling books with the most engagement, you can get a pulse for what segments your audience is comprised of and what resonates with each of them.</p><p> While doing research on the photography niche, for example, I found that there were three basic categories:</p><li> Beginners</li><li> People looking for specialized guidance (ex: composition tips or exposure)</li><li> Creative processes and insight</li><p> Category 1, beginners, appeared to generate the highest sales, reviews, and popularity. Category 2, however, was close in comparison. What&rsquo;s more, the audience profile of beginners to more specialized learners is quite different. Category 3, conversely, had the lowest sales but a high amount of engagement.</p><p> Within these categories, there were certain appeals and book titles that were more successful than others. Additionally, the customer reviews gave a clear idea of how readers responded to the content, what they liked, and what they disliked.</p><p> Numerous conclusions can be drawn from this insight.</p><p> <strong>  Ebay: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"ebay-screenshot\" height=\"277\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ebay-screenshot.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> Along with books, Ebay has a variety of products on sale &ndash; many of which likely fit in your industry.</p><p> Fortunately, Ebay also allows you to search for recently ended auctions, number of bids given, and questions and comments provided by prospects.</p><p> By checking out this data, you can see how products are pitched on the tamed &ldquo;wild west&rdquo; of the internet.</p><p> <strong>  Craigslist: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"craigslist\" height=\"327\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/craigslist.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> As valuable as Ebay is, consider Craigslist the untamed version. Anybody and everyone can post services and products online. As such, you can get a good feel for how your product or service is being sold on there as well.</p><p> Sell consulting or services? The services section likely has thousands of posts. These posters, in an attempt to get as many views as possible, continually tweak their headline and copy. As such, you can get a good feel for which appeals seem to work best (and which don&rsquo;t).</p><p> <strong>  Forums: </strong></p><p> <img alt=\"forum-image\" height=\"264\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/forum-image.jpg\" width=\"500\"/></p><p> As most all content is user generated, forums are a great source of insight on the needs, desires, and interests of your audience.</p><p> Which posts get the most engagement? What topic is discussed?</p><p> What do people talk about most? Which emotions tend to be elicited most?</p><p> Are audience members &ldquo;ego-based&rdquo;, aiming to brag or boast of their achievements? Or are they engaging and helpful?</p><p> By seeing the lingo of your audience and how they interact with one another, you can better gauge what messages will resonate with them and how to tailor your content to their personas.</p><p> As you can imagine, these are just a few of the many sites online where you can get a better understanding of your audience and industry.</p><p> The more time you spend on these sites, the more you&rsquo;ll pinpoint communication styles, cues, and &ldquo;online body language&rdquo;.</p><p> With that said, remember the simple equation posed earlier:</p><p> <strong>  Consumer Behavior + Competitor Behavior = Industry Insight </strong></p><p> While gathering consumer behavior is important, we don&rsquo;t want to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel. Our competitors have likely done similar research. Seeing what they&rsquo;ve done, in combination with what we&rsquo;ve seen from consumers, makes us more likely to succeed.</p><p> Here are a few more areas of competitive research that prove fruitful&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  #3. Ad Campaigns </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Direct mail. TV Spots. Magazine spreads. Email campaigns. All of these are competitor assets aimed at your consumer. As you&rsquo;ve gained insight into your audience, its segments, and behavior, seeing what businesses have presented to them allows you to see how communication is being executed.</p><p> Dissecting the activities of your competitors is really an art in itself.</p><p> What are the key points highlighted in these ads? Is their main benefit the same one you use? If not, how is it different?</p><p> What rationale do you think competitors are using to come up with these decisions?</p><p> While looking at one ad campaign by itself may not reveal much, that&rsquo;s where a historical timeline becomes vital.</p><p> One such ad channel where you can get historical data easily is banner advertising.</p><p> What Runs Where and AdBeat both allow you to see how long a competitor ran a banner ad, where they placed it, and how many impressions it received.</p><p> While some ad campaigns are focused solely on impressions and branding, as a general rule, the more an ad is run the more money spent.</p><p> As such, banner ads with strong longevity are more likely to be seen as successful to your competitor.</p><p> Why else would they keep running it?</p><p> Conversely, banner ads with low longevity are likely to have been perceived as failures.</p><p> Now we don&rsquo;t know for certain whether either banner was a success or not. Nevertheless, longevity lets us know that the assets on that banner (the ad copy and design) were perceived as a success.</p><p> Again, to immediately assume that a long-running banner is successful and duplicate this approach is to guess. But by adding this insight to our now-expanding industry insight arsenal, we become better aware of how this banner fits into the scheme of things.</p><h3> <strong>  #4.  Blog Post Shares </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Unlike banner ads, data on web content shares is readily available. Sites like BuzzSumo, for example, give us hard numbers on social shares of a given link.</p><p> Checking out our competitors sites and which pages received the most shares lets us know how their audience is responding to their content.</p><p> We can readily see which posts were most popular and which weren&rsquo;t.</p><p> <img alt=\"buzzsumo-shares\" height=\"272\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/buzzsumo-shares.png\" width=\"608\"/></p><h3> <strong>  #5. Origin Research </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> While the free data provided by Alexa doesn&rsquo;t reveal much, there is something it does tell you: search queries and source of origin.</p><p> This data isn&rsquo;t the most accurate but it&rsquo;s still data. And since we aren&rsquo;t basing our research solely on this source but numerous channels, the value add is worth it.</p><p> Simply checking out your competitor sites, you can collect:</p><li> What top search queries were used by consumers</li><p> <img alt=\"top-keywords\" height=\"231\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/top-keywords.png\" width=\"325\"/></p><li> What the top sites were that sent traffic to this site <img alt=\"upstream-sites\" height=\"222\" src=\"http://www.webenlighten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/upstream-sites.png\" width=\"325\"/></li><p> This information gives you a feel for who the audience is that is interacting most with your competitor sites.</p><h3> <strong>  Harmonize With Your Target Audience </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> All five above tactics are quick ways to gain more insight into your competitor and audience behaviors.</p><p> The more we can understand how our industry behaves, the better we can shape our own behaviors to cause impact.</p><p> For the fact is, there is an enormous pull in human nature for us to repeat the behaviors we&rsquo;ve already performed.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu like situation you&rsquo;ve likely experienced.</p><p> The other day, for example, I drove past a funky house and said a comment to my girlfriend only to realize that it was the exact same comment I said weeks earlier.</p><p> This type of situation happens all the time online as well.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve seen customers purchase an eBook they bought years ago without even realizing it. When I catch this, I inform them and give them a refund. But it still amazes me how this happens at least once a month!</p><p> Nevertheless, it makes sense.</p><p> Someone that buys an XYZ widget is much more likely to buy the same widget &ndash; with a slight different presentation or angle. Give enough time to pass and they may even buy the same widget without even knowing it.</p><p> We as marketers bore of doing the same things over and over again. And the idea of copying the approach of our competitors can seem repelling to many.</p><p> Coming up with new approaches to marketing, however, should never be sparked solely from boredom or guesswork.</p><p> Instead, treat your digital marketing strategy and execution like science &ndash; based on fact and grounded research.</p><p> When you do this, discovering innovation is like clockwork.</p><p> Spinoza, a 17th century dutch philosopher, believed to fully comprehend a text, you must study not just sections of it, but the entire work, it&rsquo;s historical context, and its origin.</p><p> <strong>  The same can be said for your industry. </strong></p><p> Build your marketing strategy on grounded, proven principles of behavior known to resonate with your audience.</p><p> When you do this, you gain insight that can guide your strategy for years to come.</p><p> Consider it an investment.</p><p> As such, the more you put into industry insight, the more you&rsquo;ll get.</p>",

    "link": "thinking-of-quitting-why-it-may-not-be-such-a-bad-thing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> In our culture, quitting anything other than a bad habit has a negative connotation&mdash;but you argue that quitting is positive. What are some situations in which quitting is beneficial? <br/>  </h3><p> Rumination and self-doubt can be physically exhausting. If you find yourself in an endless loop hoping for a positive outcome, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re operating in an energy deficit. Prolonged periods can impact your health. So, watch your moods and physical sense of well-being; are you routinely exhausted? </p><p> Unable to enjoy activities other than prescribed ones? If so, you may be in a locked situation where you should consider whether quitting is a healthier choice. This doesn&rsquo;t just apply to your habits&mdash;you can quit a job, a relationship, or even a hobby that no longer fulfills you.</p><h3> Why does quitting have to be learned? <br/>  </h3><p> We&rsquo;re primed toward optimism, and culturally speaking we admire stick-to-itiveness. Quitting should be an equal opportunity choice, and choosing to quit is not instinctive. We have to train ourselves away from the unconscious associations that quitting is for losers and a sign of weakness.</p><h3> Are some people naturally better at quitting than others? What makes a person oriented toward approach or avoidance? <br/>  </h3><p> Oddly enough, pessimists may have an edge in judging the likely outcomes of situations. Optimists by and large overestimate their likelihood of success and their predictions exaggerate toward positive outcomes. As to questions of &ldquo;approach&rdquo; or &ldquo;avoidance,&rdquo; the tendency towards that psychological tilt is usually established early in life. Some of your approach may be genetic, of course, and part of your character make-up, but many tendencies may come from either integrating a parent&rsquo;s style or the subtle rewards we received for following their approval. If you had been encouraged to try options where you might fail&mdash;like applying to a top tier college, for example&mdash;you may be biased toward &ldquo;approach.&rdquo; If, on the other hand, you fear the consequences of rejection and stick to &ldquo;safe&rdquo; schools, you may have an avoidance temperament. These tendencies usually radiate into other areas of life as well, encouraging some people to constantly expand their social circle while others are only comfortable with old friends. We can train ourselves to recognize these biases and allow for their unconscious persistence.</p><h3> What are the factors that encourage people to persist? <br/>  </h3><p> Some factors are genetic and psychological as mentioned above, and others are moral and societal. Culturally speaking, most advanced societies treasure the notion of improvement and mastery. Quitting interrupts that trope and forces us to evaluate our self-worth at a primal level: are we failures? Do we lack the moral fiber to experience discomfort and maintain our position in life? Are we doomed to an ongoing series of failures and disruptions? The anxieties and fears raised by these associations may keep people locked into relationships or careers that are, in fact, troubling to their mental and physical well-being.</p><h3> How can people tell it&rsquo;s time to quit? <br/>  </h3><p> There is no single answer to that question. The first order of business is to examine the underlying issues which support the status quo. How prevalent is your anxiety about losing respect from key people in your life? How impacted will you be by the concern that you have labeled yourself a &ldquo;quitter&rdquo;? Once you have established some equanimity about these questions, you can go on to evaluate the choice from the perspective of a value proposition&mdash;what are you getting vs. what are you giving up? Our book takes you through the research of &ldquo;choice&rdquo; so you&rsquo;re less likely to operate off unconscious biases and more likely to operate with a conscious sense of opportunity.</p><h3> What are the basic steps to quitting successfully? <br/>  </h3><p> We have a number of different tables in the book which may help you decide your quitting style. It&rsquo;s important to know the biases in your particular make-up that may orient you toward getting stuck or lurching precipitously toward the exit. Once you have established the possible tendencies in your personal psychological construct, you are more likely to review options based on their current and potential future outcomes. Our book is not a &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; manual; rather, it helps you understand through current research what the potential biases and blind-spots in your thinking may be and then how to form long and short-term goals to move your decision-making forward with a conscious sense of choice.</p><h3> How should people manage the thoughts and emotions associated with quitting, especially regret? <br/>  </h3><p> There is no ultimate screen against regret, though some people charge ahead trailing less doubt and replay than others. In order to use regret to keep you focused on how to succeed next time instead of letting it keep you stuck in the past, you should think about how your regrets relate to the goals you want&mdash;instead of defending the decision you regret, putting off new decisions, or transferring blame to others. I also encourage people to operate with some time-limits on their &ldquo;pity party&rdquo;&mdash;such as taking a half hour for &ldquo;why me&rdquo; thinking&mdash;as needed&ndash; and then moving ahead with your next plan.</p><h3> What is incomplete quitting? <br/>  </h3><p> Incomplete quitting, at least on the surface, often looks like a person disengaging from an unproductive goal, but it often leaves in place the mechanisms and motivations for persisting with it in the first place, preventing the person from moving forward towards new goals. A person could temporarily sever a relationship, or suggest a new course of action, but not stick with their new resolutions and fall back on existing patterns&mdash;or even just threaten to, and never follow through at all. Whatever shapes it takes, incomplete quitting is marked by an inability to disengage.</p><p> If the regret loop keeps replaying and seems out of control, shadowing your capacity to move ahead with plans, you&rsquo;re likely caught in an incomplete quitting cycle. In the book, we have an example of a highly qualified person who kept reminding his friends and interviewers what a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; he&rsquo;d made in his career choice and what a hash he&rsquo;d made of his young life. He had not organized himself to move ahead in new directions and &gt;was &lt;cueing his audience to see him as a &ldquo;quitter.&rdquo; Not surprisingly, until he was able to acknowledge his self-doubt he &gt;was&lt; unable to develop new pathways.</p><p> Quitting is a prime opportunity for reframing a situation, imagining new possibilities, and reinventing yourself. How should people establish new goals to move them in a better direction?</p><p> The most likely source of encouraging success in new directions is actually writing down goals, creating objectives to get to those goals and establishing workable timelines. All these can be modified or even eradicated as you move forward in your planning, but the act of committing your future plans to an organized series of thoughts and timetables seems to be a key factor in releasing yourself from rumination, stuck thinking and self-blame. The transition from past analysis to future planning seems to reorient the psyche, though as I mentioned some time should be reserved to &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo; and self-doubt.</p><p> Instead of sayings like &ldquo;winners never quit and quitters never win&rdquo; and &ldquo;no one likes a quitter,&rdquo; what saying about quitting would you suggest society adopt instead?</p><p> Review your options and remind yourself: the creative life involves constant choice. No single maxim should control the decision-making process.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The task of searching for long-term care is chock full of need-to-know data. <br/>  </h3><p> The person's health condition, their strengths and weaknesses, and if they are able to be on their on and alone? Family members want what's best for a relative especially when it comes to their safety, health, and well-being. And moving a parent to an assisted living facility is their default. Whereas, the older parent is headstrong on staying put and be free to go as they please.</p><p> When you buck heads, take a break and relax. Unless you're in an emergency and a parent needs care pronto, ease up and digest the following guide to help determine if long-term is necessary. Remember each situation is different and what worked for one person may not be the best option for your parent.</p><p> Before deciding to seek help, the first step is to assess the physical, mental, and medical frailty conditions of your loved one. Is your parent slow to recover from an illness? The condition could compromise their general well-being, and getting outside care assistance to get back on their feet is sensible.</p><p> As people get older, the risks of falling increases. Do they have an ongoing chronic condition? Chronic illnesses can significantly affect one's body's strength and recovery time. What level is their self-care activity? Can they get dressed on their own, do house chores, manage medications, keep doctor appointments? Here are four questions to assess the need for help.</p><h3> 1. How frail is your parent physically? <br/>  </h3><p> Are they losing or gaining weight? Do they have an appetite and are they eating well? Can they walk without holding on to furniture for balance? Is their gait steady? Do they slouch in the chair when sitting?</p><h3> 2. How resilient is your parent's mental ability? <br/>  </h3><p> Have they given up on social activities? Are they isolating because of the fear to fall? Do they show reluctance to leaving the house? If so, these are significant red flags that point to potential depression and forgetfulness. Other signs of mental decline are hopelessness and despair, listlessness, a change in sleeping patterns and losing interest in hobbies. Remember - people who have trouble with walking, memory, and hearing will pull away and isolate.</p><h3> 3. Is your parent on track with their medical procedures? <br/>  </h3><p> Do they forget to take medications? If they have multiple chronic conditions, they take several medicines. Are they on track with recommended dosage and timetables? Monitoring and managing meds is very confusing and overwhelming.</p><h3> 4. The money signs of decline <br/>  </h3><p> Are they keeping up with household bills? Are they checking the mail and responding to personal correspondence? Do you see unopened bills and unread newspapers sitting on the table? If so, be sure to look for overdue invoices, overdrawn balances, or other concerning communications.</p><p> Timing is everything. It's common for family members to feel uncomfortable when talking with a parent about long-term care needs, but you cannot dance around it. The conversation must happen and the sooner, the better. Don't wait till an accident happens or a significant illness occurs. That's when emotions run high. Don't procrastinate and remember that timing is everything when it comes to family discussions on elder care.</p>",

    "title": "Is Your Retirement Advisor a Fiduciary?",
    "link": "is-your-retirement-advisor-a-fiduciary",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Do you want a financial professional who is opposed to financial transparency managing your money?</h3>The upcoming and long anticipated <u> proposed rules by the Department of Labor</u> (&ldquo;DOL&rdquo;) exposes that very debate, as it seeks to eliminate the ability of financial advisors to profit by selling retirement account products to investors without being held to a &ldquo;fiduciary standard.&rdquo;For those wondering what that means, with a fiduciary standard an advisor must always act in your (their client&rsquo;s) best interests. A fiduciary standard ensures that the advisor&rsquo;s duty is to the client only, not the corporation they represent. To the surprise of many, that currently is not always the case. Financial advisors have had the ability to profit (through commissions and high fees) to the potential detriment of their clients. That is exactly what many large financial institutions and insurance companies have done. In fact, the federal government estimates that there are roughly <u> $17 billion dollars</u> of fees generated each year from conflicted advice.The DOL has made clear &ndash;and we agree&ndash; that a commission based investment model creates a conflict of interest. Companies with a commission based model operate with an inherent conflict: the pressure to sell products that are more profitable for them and/or their firm can be important factors in how they direct you to invest. For example, an advisor may receive a 5% commission by selling you a fund through their company when you could get a similar product elsewhere without commission. Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you. That is the primary reason we stay completely independent and operate as conflict-free, fee-only advisors.The proposed DOL rule will hopefully begin to fix this issue as it is expected to require a strict fiduciary standard for financial advisors in the context of sales for retirement account products.  This standard will require advisors to certify that they are acting independently and in their client&rsquo;s best interest, and are not motivated by the prospect of a commission. This has created a firestorm among big insurance companies, broker dealers and other institutional investors who, as we pointed out, don&rsquo;t typically operate as fiduciaries.In a <u> <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/306476032/Elizabeth-Warren-letter-to-SEC?secret_password=aGGzGnDFye7HhhQe5m4V\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  letter sent last week to the SEC </a></u>, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong proponent of the proposed DOL rule, pointed out that presidents of Transamerica, Lincoln National, Jackson National and Prudential all have called this proposal &ldquo;unworkable.&rdquo;  She commented on the self interest in their position, and the danger in permitting unwitting investors to be guided by non-fiduciaries in the context of their retirement investments.<h3> Why would a rule that requires a financial advisor to act in their client&rsquo;s best interest create such an uproar?</h3>One reason is that <u> <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/fee-only-fiduciaries/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  unlike Sherman Wealth Management </a></u>, they are in a commission driven model, and therefore fear that the way they currently serve clients would not meet the standards of this new rule. We hope that because of the conflict a commission driven model creates, that eventually enough pressure from policy-makers like Senator Warren and Labor Secretary Perez will propel this proposed new rule beyond just retirement accounts. In the meantime, think to yourself why anyone would oppose this rule if not for purely selfish reasons?",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Living simply with fewer material possessions leaves room for more soul&rdquo; (meaning more joy, connection, peace, and spirituality).</p><h3> &ldquo;Material possessions prohibit one from finding deep contentment.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Recently I had a conversation with a person who deeply believed these two money scripts. She was sure there was great emotional and spiritual reward in ridding oneself of the trappings of materialism and living simply and in poverty.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve conducted many workshops where participants uncover and examine their money scripts, which are the thoughts and beliefs they have about money. I&rsquo;ve never run into a money script that wasn&rsquo;t true in some circumstances and false in others. The more certain a person is that a money script is true, the greater the chance that it will be the source of financial and emotional suffering and pain when circumstances change, which they inevitably have a way of doing.</p><p> Like all money scripts, these two contain some truth. Money and material possessions cannot in themselves create happiness. However, having enough money to get out of poverty certainly does make people happier. Research shows a direct relationship between more money and happiness until someone&rsquo;s income reaches around $50,000 to $80,000, enough (in the US and depending on location) to meet basic needs comfortably. Beyond that, more money doesn&rsquo;t correlate to more happiness.</p><p> Many would equate having more money with having more stuff. While often true, this is not always the case. Charles Dickens&rsquo;s famous miser, Ebenezer Scrooge, was wealthy but lived like a pauper. His lack of material possessions certainly did not give him more joy or contentment. In fact, it was a symptom of the spiritual emptiness he lived with until he was transformed.</p><p> Money and the things it can buy are not what stifles joy, connection, peace, and spirituality. Money is a 21st century survival tool; it touches everything we do and without it our very survival is threatened. It&rsquo;s how money is viewed and used that can open us to connection or isolate us, cause us turmoil or fill us with serenity.</p><p> There is also a significant difference between poverty by choice and poverty by circumstance. Living in poverty is not the same as living simply. There&rsquo;s nothing simple about the day-to-day anxiety of being poor. It may mean juggling second jobs, child care, and transportation; living in fear of a child getting sick or the car breaking down; or coping with the bureaucratic and often illogical demands of systems that provide assistance. Struggling to get by without enough money is hardly a lifestyle that leaves room for spiritual contentment.</p><p> Poverty by choice, in contrast, means living simply despite being able to afford more. It may be that knowing one has the means of acquiring more, yet choosing to live without, may exercise more spiritual muscles than going without of necessity. It may also be somewhat disingenuous for someone living simply within a financial safety net to preach the virtues of poverty.</p><p> Having modest earnings, little net worth, and few possessions is not exactly poverty if one has control over or access to assets and even luxuries. Some religious leaders and heads of charitable institutions, for example, may be provided with the means to live comfortably and be freed from responsibility for the housekeeping necessities of daily life. Living simply by choice in this way can free them to focus on their work or spiritual development.</p><h3> Maybe the most balanced perspective is to view living simply through a lens of &ldquo;enough.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> If we don&rsquo;t have enough for basic necessities, how can we be content? If we  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/healthy-money-relationships/having-enough-for-happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   do have enough  </a> </u> , do we really care if someone else has more?</p>",

    "content": "<p> Student loan payments aren&rsquo;t just a check you send each month to the lender.  Being massively in debt can have a profound psychological impact on a person. </p><h3> I&rsquo;ve found the two genders tend to view it differently. </h3><p> <br/> In general, I find women to view debt as something unfavorable, almost like a blemish, while for men it&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s there as part of life.  I recently had a meeting with a female attorney, one so despondent about her overwhelming debt that tears came to her eyes. [1]    I reassured her that this debt is a good one to have, and that she should be proud of the investment she made in her education and her career.  &ldquo;But Sara,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so&hellip;ugly.&rdquo;</p><p> Women tend to worry about the implications of being in debt much more than men do.  I consistently have heard female attorneys resist consolidating their federal loans because they fear losing the three years unemployment protection that these loans offer.  I&rsquo;ve never heard a male attorney express the same concern.  In other words, the men tend to be more inclined to pursue a refinancing that would create a lower interest rate and allow them to pay down debt faster. They&rsquo;re more likely to take that risk than the women I know.</p><p> Also, the women I talk to have seemed reluctant to pursue other aspects of life until their debt is gone, while the men are willing to move forward while paying down debt simultaneously.  When I share with women how I waited until later in life to have children, most of the female attorneys I talk to agree that they would rather experience financial stability and live debt free before having a family.  Perhaps we have this attitude because we haven&rsquo;t completely come to terms with our equality. It&rsquo;s possible that subconsciously we&rsquo;re worried the effects of life events on our income, such as marriage, children, and workplace discrimination due to bearing children.  Or maybe it is because being in debt makes us fear losing our independence.</p><p> Ironically, however, women seem to be the better debt managers of the two genders.  They are more likely to seek debt counseling than men (maybe because of less ego), and less likely to default on payments. [2]   Women tend to carry less debt than men as well. [3]</p><p> So in other words, we women take on less debt, manage it more thoughtfully, and get ourselves into less trouble than men. Why is it, then, that we are the ones with the anxiety about it?  Maybe it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re more subject to our emotions than men.  If so, ladies, then let&rsquo;s use this emotion as a positive motivator rather than a hindrance to getting ourselves on the right side of the balance sheet!   </p><p>  </p>[1] Any similarity to persons living or dead is entirely coincidental.<br/>[2] http://www.creditinfocenter.com/debt/women-have-more-debt.shtml<br/>[3] http://www.bankrate.com/finance/debt/men-women-and-debt-does-gender-matter.aspx",

    "link": "5-new-facebook-features-to-generate-monster-sales",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Facebook is one helluva marketing beast. Between the publishing possibilities, community engagement, advertising space, and the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   1.6 billion individuals who inhabit the digital space  </a> </u> , Facebook alone can turn a brand into an internationally-known corporation.</p><p> Facebook already provides businesses with a plethora of resources to gain traffic, conversions, awareness, and everything else a business needs to succeed. As of last September, the social juggernaut  <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/business/news/pages-updates\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  announced </a>  a brand new set of features which will ultimately prove to be a vital resource for many businesses when it comes to driving sales, gaining attention, and understanding their audience&rsquo;s habits. Digital storefronts and physical shops alike can reap massive benefits from these five new tools from Facebook.</p><h3> <strong>  #1: New and Improved CTAs </strong></h3><p> <br/> CTAs, or calls-to-action, are a fundamental element to driving conversions, engagements, and other primary business goals. And since mobile is quickly becoming the preferred platform for nearly every interaction and task that occurs in the digital universe, Facebook has selected to implement a set of new CTAs to optimize the mobile experience for both users and companies. The CTAs can be incorporated below the cover photo and include options like:</p><li> Sign Up</li><li> Watch Video</li><li> Book Now</li><li> Contact Us</li><p> Businesses will decide whatever page these new CTAs link to, enabling them to achieve the metrics they aim to hit. When used properly, the new buttons can serve as a way of entering a person into the sales funnel.</p><h3> <strong>  #2: The Ability to Buy </strong></h3><p> <br/> Alongside the new CTAs, Facebook is giving brands the gift of a &ldquo;Shopping&rdquo; tab that can be displayed on business pages. The new tab will essentially act as a miniature storefront by allowing page visitors to view products and make purchases directly on the platform. &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; buttons will be featured, which comes as little surprise after the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/33764868-shopify-and-facebook-announce-expanded-beta-test-for-buy-call-to-action-button\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Facebook/Shopify collaboration project  </a> </u> .</p><p> Make no mistake, this is huge news for businesses who utilize the omnipresent social portal as Facebook has let it be known that  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/shopping-on-facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   almost half of its 1.6 billion users come to the platform actively in search of products  </a> </u> . This opportunity, combined with the potential saving of operating a sales website, could mean a massive income boost for many.</p><h3> <strong>  #3: Let Your Services Shine </strong></h3><p> <br/> For those who operate service-based businesses, there is no need to fret as Facebook has you covered too. &ldquo;Service&rdquo; tabs are also a new feature headed to business pages. These new sections will allow brands to bring their predominantly intangible services to a material and accessible level for users and help boost awareness around exactly what these companies offer. While services are still less likely to be purchased by potential buyers than products, the visibility alone makes generating sales and awareness easier and more feasible. When combined with the new CTAs, there is a good chance that you will see an increased number of prospects contacting your company.</p><h3> <strong>  #4: Figuring Out Foot Traffic </strong></h3><p> <br/> Facebook isn&rsquo;t just helping out those in the digital arena. Brick-and-mortar stores can also rejoice as the company has  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/local-awareness-updates\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   improved its Page Insights  </a> </u>  to help local businesses understand the foot traffic and trends in their area. A new Page Insights tab leverages user app locations to understand when certain neighborhoods are most active, determine how many users are within a 1,500 foot radius of their business location, as well as provide information such as age, gender, and if the person is a resident or tourist.</p><h3> <strong>  #5: Ads Based on Location </strong></h3><p> <br/> Adding another layer and dimension to  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/a/local-awareness-ads\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2014&rsquo;s local awareness ads  </a> </u> , Facebook is now offering location specific ads for brands that have more than one store location. What this boils down to is that whenever an individual is near a select location, those users can be served that store&rsquo;s name, address, and a CTA providing directions or a phone number. This can help boost a store&rsquo;s foot traffic and awareness within the area, help generate more sales and local followers, and will make targeted ads more effective and relevant to users.</p><p> These new add-ons supplied by Facebook are a huge win for any business trying to garner sales via the social portal. No matter if your strategy is through ad campaigns, driving visitors to your website or physical location, or gaining sales directly from Facebook, there is something here to help boost your numbers and pad your wallet. Good times indeed!</p>",

    "link": "6-things-to-look-out-for-when-hiring-an-seo-firm",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When using search engines, 75% of users never scroll past the first page of search results ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/24-eye-popping-seo-statistics/42665/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Search Engine Journal  </a> </u> ).  </p><h3> The higher your search engine ranking, the more traffic your website will receive.</h3><p> <br/> So yes, you want to be on that first page &ndash; but how do you get there? You can get there by improving your  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/what-is-search-engine-optimization-seo-and-why-do-i-need-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   search engine optimization  </a> </u>  (SEO).</p><p> Some individuals hire companies that specialize in SEO and see tremendous results. Although, just like anything you invest in, you want to make sure it&rsquo;s worth the money. There are many SEO firms that focus on getting quick cash without delivering long-term SEO benefits for their clients, and others that tend to focus on making false promises. Here are some things to consider when hiring an SEO firm:</p><h3> <strong>  Ask for current and past clients.         </strong>     </h3><p> <br/> Just like reading customer reviews before buying a new phone, you should find out other clients&rsquo; experiences when looking into working with an SEO firm. Find out how successful the SEO firm&rsquo;s past work has been by asking them to provide you a list of past clients. Read customer reviews, testimonials and case studies. The last thing you want is to blindly commit to a big contract.</p><h3> <strong>  How experienced are they? </strong></h3><p> <br/> SEO is a fast-changing industry. You want to hire an expert who is able to adapt to changes and is knowledgeable about the latest developments and trends in SEO. Keep in mind that you should look for quality in their experience and how successful they have been rather than focus on how long they have been in the industry.</p><h3> <strong>  Does their website have good content? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Think of it this way: You want to ensure your prospects and clients that you are a knowledgeable and up to date. You do this through  <a href=\"http://www.digitalagent.com/why-the-new-seo-is-actually-all-about-content-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  content marketing </a> ; by writing about topics that are relevant to your industry. Just the same, you want to make sure that the SEO firm you hire is knowledgeable and current in their field.</p><h3> <strong>  Establish communication </strong></h3><p> <br/> Paying someone to optimize your website without having any real gains (conversions, new leads, new clients, etc) is as good as nothing.  There are many questions you should be asking to establish better communication throughout the process like:</p><li> What areas will you focus on to improve my websites&rsquo; SEO?</li><li> How often will I be updated with analytics and your progress?</li><li> How will you improve our search engine rankings?</li><li> Will you inform me on all changes you make to my website? <br/>  </li><p> You want to always be on the same page as your consultant and the best time to do that is before you agree to any contracts.</p><h3> <strong>  Are they making you unrealistic promises? </strong></h3><p> <br/> One way to set apart an SEO salesmen from a legitimate SEO expert is what promises they are making to you. Many SEO salesmen tell prospects that with their work, your website will rank #1 on search engines. Rankings alone are a bad metric for overall performance. It&rsquo;s more important that the search results drive relevant visitors that take a desired action &ndash; such as signing up for a mailing list or making a purchase &ndash; once they land on your page.  Making these kinds of statements are fishy. This could mean that the SEO firm may be using illegitimate ways to get you to #1 such as Black Hat SEO techniques.</p><h3> <strong>  What happens post-contract? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Who maintains ownership, of the optimized web content that you paid the consultant to provide, once your contract is up? Make sure to come to an agreement with the SEO firm that once you part ways, they will not remove any of the content they have added, modified, or optimized on your behalf.</p><p> ---------------------------------</p><p> If you choose to hire an SEO firm to better optimize your website, be sure that it is legitimate.  A bad or inexperienced SEO firm can have a negative impact, in the long run, on your business&rsquo; online presence and search engine rankings.</p>",

Tony Schwartz, author of The Way We&rsquo;re Working Isn&rsquo;t Working: The Four Forgotten Needs That Energize Great Performance, champions the notion of a Chief Energy Officer.</p><h3> Cool. Creative job titles that speak to what, deep down, we all long for. Less drudgery at work. More inspiration. An energized and energizing ride.</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re fortunate, you work in a culture like Zappos where every aspect of the organizational design is intended to motivate and energize you. Free lunches. Freedom to decorate your meeting spaces. Free life-coaching. An explicit work culture that does much of the energizing for you.</p><p> Chances are, you&rsquo;re not employed at Zappos, and you will not suddenly be anointed Chief Energy Officer where you currently work. Don&rsquo;t let that hold you back. Here are 4 habits that will help you to immediately become the inspirational Chief Energy Officer you long to be &ndash; and the one your colleagues love to engage with:</p><h3> <strong>  1. Notes of Appreciation:  </strong></h3><p> Show that you noticed. Saying it, especially when the saying reveals the specifics you observed, is terrific. But when you write it down, not in an email, no, in an old-school note-appreciation-card &ndash; wow, then it carries the weight and impact of a well-considered gesture.</p><p> Write 1 note of appreciation a week. It takes less than 5 minutes to do so. It will be an exhilarating energy catalyst.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Happy Endings:  </strong></h3><p> Have great meetings. Disagree vigorously. Challenge each other. And at the end, affirm the fire and spirit of the discourse that occurred. The Happy-Ending-Affirmation may come from you. Or invite all meeting participants to affirm each other.</p><p> No meeting ends without a vigorous affirmation of the positive that occurred.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Passionate Curiosity:  </strong></h3><p> Even when you&rsquo;re sure of a course of action, even when you feel like you do not wish to be derailed by a tangential comment, stay curious. Yes. DON&rsquo;T BE RIGHT, BE CURIOUS. Your curiosity will energize everyone around you.</p><p> Talk less, ask more. In every situation. Even when you think you have all the answers.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Conscious Optimism:  </strong></h3><p> While you&rsquo;re caught in a crappy day, as you have grave doubts about a course of action, face your reality, in that moment. Face it &ndash; but refrain from unloading every detail of your anxiety on those around you. Speak your truth, but infuse it with optimism.</p><p> Consciously stated faith and optimism will energize those around you. It will energize you. Constant worrying will not. </p><p> <strong>  The beauty of these 4 simple habits: </strong> While you energize others with these behaviors, you also energize yourself. You become, in fact, your very own Chief Energy Officer.  How very cool is that!</p> ",

    "title": "The Right Time to Talk Taxes",
    "link": "the-right-time-to-talk-taxes",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> April 15th is fast approaching. Now more than ever, it&rsquo;s the right time to talk taxes.</h3><p> <br/> For many clients, taxes can be the single biggest investment expense they will face, particularly the high net worth&mdash;with rates as high as 40 or even 50 percent every year when federal and state taxes are combined.  </p><p> But there are solutions to help clients reduce taxable income and minimize the impact of taxes on investment gains. Start with tax deferral. A strategic use of tax deferral can generate additional tax-alpha of 100 bps or more&mdash;without increasing risk&mdash; to help clients build more wealth.</p><h3> <strong>  Max Out Tax-Deferred Qualified Plans: </strong></h3><p> <br/> Clients should take full advantage of tax-deferred qualified plans.  By contributing pre-tax dollars, clients can reduce their taxable income now, accumulate more through years of tax-deferred compounding, and pay taxes in retirement&mdash;when they are likely to be in a lower tax bracket.</p><p> Start with employer sponsored plans such as 401(k)s&mdash;especially if there is an employer match. For the self-employed, common tax-deferred qualified plans are Simplified Employee Pension Plans (SEP IRAs), Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE IRA), and individual 401(k)s. Once workplace plans are maxed out, clients can make contributions using pre-tax dollars to Traditional IRAs and after tax dollars to Roth IRAs.</p><p> The 2015 contribution limit for workplace plans such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s is $18,000, up from $17,500 in 2014. The catch-up contribution limit for participants ages 50 and older is $6,000, up from $5,000. The 2015 contribution limit for traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs is $5,500, with catch-up contribution limit of $1,000. Contributions to workplace plans must be made before December 31 of the specific tax year. Contributions to Traditional and Roth IRAs can be made until the April 15 filing deadline.</p><h3> <strong>  Leverage Low-Cost No-Load IOVAs: </strong></h3><p> <br/> High net worth and high earners can quickly max out the contribution limits of their qualified plans and need other options for more tax-deferral. But many advisors overlook traditional tax-deferred variable annuities, because of high costs, steep commissions and limited fund choices.</p><p> Now a new generation of Investment-Only Variable Annuities (IOVAs) has been built to maximize tax deferral and fit the fee-only model. Designed as a true tax-advantaged investing platform&mdash;instead of a costly and complex insurance product&mdash;this new category of IOVAs features low costs, no commission, and more funds. Effectively, IOVAs can be used as a &ldquo;401(k) Extender&rdquo; to help your clients minimize taxes over the long term and maximize tax-deferred accumulation.</p><h3> <strong>  Asset Location for Alternative Strategies: </strong></h3><p> <br/> To manage volatility, mitigate risks and potentially generate more alpha, many advisors use non-correlated assets such as liquid alternatives. But these can be tax-inefficient due to high turnover and short term capital gains. Using asset location&mdash;to &ldquo;locate&rdquo; tax-inefficient assets in a tax-deferred vehicle like a qualified plan or a low-cost IOVA&mdash;can preserve all of the upside without the drag of taxes. For investors heavily allocated to fixed-income, commodities and REITS&mdash;typically taxed at higher ordinary income rates&mdash;asset location can have a measurable impact as well.</p><p> Other tax-planning strategies to implement now and throughout the year include:</p><h3> <strong>  Tax-Loss Harvesting </strong></h3><p> <br/> Clients can harvest losses to offset investment gains and lower their tax liability. Focus on rebalancing their portfolio or selling investments that no longer fit their goals. Don&rsquo;t sell with the intention of buying shares back right away. The IRS &ldquo;wash sale&rdquo; rule bars investors from claiming the loss if they buy the same or a &ldquo;substantially identical&rdquo; investment within 30 days of the sale.</p><h3> <strong>  Annual Gift Tax Exemption </strong></h3><p> <br/> An individual client can gift of up to $14,000 per year&mdash;and couples can gift of up to $28,000 per year&mdash;to an unlimited number of recipients. These gifts help reduce the taxable estate&mdash;and are exempt from federal gift taxes. Gifts may include cash, stocks, bonds, and real estate. To contribute toward a child&rsquo;s education, payments made directly to an educational institution typically incur no gift tax. To fund education also consider a tax-deferred 529 plan.</p><h3> <strong>  Charitable Contributions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Even small contributions add up. Clients should track all donations, and must receive proof for donations of $250 or more. When making a significant gift to charity, consider appreciated stocks or mutual fund shares that clients have owned for more than one year. The deduction is the fair-market value of the securities on the date of the gift&mdash;not the amount the client originally paid for the asset. Boost tax returns by deducting the appreciated amount&mdash;while never paying taxes on the profit.</p><h3> <strong>  Talk Taxes Now&mdash;and All Year </strong></h3><p> <br/> Taxes may be one of the biggest investment expenses that your clients face. By using the power of tax deferral, leveraging the benefits of low-cost Investment-Only VAs, and taking a more strategic approach to managing taxes with asset location, you can help clients minimize taxes, optimize their portfolio and build more wealth. The advantages are clear. So talk taxes now&mdash;and all year long.</p><p> Learn more about Jefferson National <a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Building a great business is rarely the result of a single champion taking on the world.  </h3><p> <br/> The champion business owner is usually the captain of a team that has taken on the world.  Of course, for the team to become champions the captain has to have them focussed on doing the right things, and then ensuring that they are prepared adequately to execute those right things.</p><p> Having the right people on the team, focussed on doing the right things, and then having them do those right things better than the competition is a pretty surefire formula for success.</p><p> One of the best examples of how to apply this formula came about a few years ago, from the world of sport.  The captain of a world champion rugby team was asked how his team had become champions, when they had not even been considered likely finalists to begin with. His response was along the following lines:</p><p> &ldquo;We won because everyone on the team had the same individual goal: be 1% better at everything we have to do in a game than our opposite number is in that same game&rdquo;</p><p> He went on to explain that perfection in how they played was never expected.  Winning any particular game was not the team focus either. Hoping for superhuman effort or heroics didn&rsquo;t come into the equation at any time, and nor did relying on good fortune.</p><p> Each player in this champion team did know however precisely what the key functions of their role was, and each honed their skills relentlessly in being able to execute their own particular job just a little bit better than whoever they were pitted against.  In simple terms this meant jumping to catch a ball for example didn&rsquo;t require a 2 metre leap&hellip;it just required being 2 inches higher than the opposition player trying to catch the same ball.  Getting 2 hands near the ball to catch it wasn&rsquo;t good enough; it required 10 fingers on the ball.</p><p> The point is a simple one: if we are 1% better in skill and execution on the things that really matter than our competition are, then we are a very very good chance of getting the result.</p><h3> How can we apply this to building a champion Advisory Firm?</h3><p> <br/> Set aspirational but clear expectations: being 1% better than anyone you come up against is actually a very high standard to set.  Aspirational standards and objectives are necessary in order to achieve extraordinary success.  Ensuring those expectations are unequivocally clear and measurable, and being applied consistently to the entire team, is a critical driver of success.</p><h3> <strong>  Accept reality: </strong></h3><p> We shall never be perfect at everything we try to do. Perfection is not the goal; being 1% better than the competition is.</p><h3> <strong>  Be best at what comes next: </strong></h3><p> Winning the entire market is not what comes next; dealing with the next client comes next and we need to win there first.</p><h3> <strong>  Know what skills matter: </strong></h3><p> To win over that next client we have to know what skills are required to get them as a client. If we cannot win over individual prospects then market domination is merely a dream.</p><h3> <strong>  Practice the key skills: </strong>  </h3><p> Practice doesn&rsquo;t happen &ldquo;in the game&rdquo;.  Being 1% better at executing key skills doesn&rsquo;t happen without practice. Practice the key skills before you get into the game with prospects and clients.  That means training&hellip;lots and lots of training.  For the rest of your carer.</p><h3> <strong>  Be 1% better than your next competitor at ALL the key skills: </strong></h3><p> Being the world&rsquo;s best &ldquo;closer&rdquo; (or negotiator or coach or whatever) doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t get to use that skill because you didn&rsquo;t get far in the engagement to use it.</p><p> Being the best kicker of a ball won&rsquo;t lead to your team winning a championship team if you can&rsquo;t also run, pass and catch for instance.  It is the combination of having all the right skills that results in winning.</p><p> These are the 6 fundamental principles which matter if you want to build a superb professional services firm which can dominate its chosen market.  Get these right, and the result you want will come.</p>",

    "content": "<p> As a financial advisor, what is your process to build trust, and become a trusted advisor to high net worth clients? Do you have a process, including a well documented value promise, that you give to your best prospects?</p><p> We understand that your clients trust you. The question is how much do they trust you? On a scale from 1 to 100, what percent would you say your top clients trust you? How do you know if it is 100%? <a href=\"http://www.billbachrach.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Bill Bachrach  </u> </a> once said, &ldquo;truth is that most financial professionals have little or no idea why their clients trust them or how to replicate high-trust client relationships.</p><p> Trust is not something that should happen by accident. We understand that your clients trust you. The question is how much do they trust you?&rdquo; How do you get your clients trust meter to 100% and gain all of their business and referrals?</p><h3> Building a high trust process</h3><p> <br/> Do you have a consistent framework or key process for each interview structured in such a way as to build trust and gather all of the relevant information to help this person? Years ago as an advisor I was taught to probe for hot buttons and ask all kinds of questions. Then one day I came across a book by Bill Bachrach titled, Values-Based Selling: The Art of Building High-Trust Client Relationships.</p><p> Soon after I read the book I contacted Bill and his team about their processes. Since practice management is all about processes, I wanted to find out about how they do it. This lead into reading his next book, Values-Based Financial Planning: The Art of Creating and Inspiring Financial Strategy.</p><p> As Bill says about his process with clients and prospects, &ldquo;In the grand scheme of things, money's not that important. It's important only to the extent that it allows you to enjoy what's important to you. And not worrying about your finances is critical to having a life that excites you, nurtures those you love, and fulfills your highest aspirations. If you want to make smart choices about money, based on what is important to you--your core values, this book is for you.&rdquo;</p><p> Another truth is that most financial professionals have little or no idea why their clients trust them or how to replicate high-trust client relationships. Trust is not something that should happen by accident.</p><h3> Case study</h3><p> <br/> Whether you use Bill&rsquo;s process or not, having a system of gathering the client&rsquo;s goals and financial information, gaining trust, and getting commitment in less than one hour can be challenging. According to Bill, &ldquo;sales training addresses the symptoms, not the problem. When people do not respond to your advice, they are really telling you they don&rsquo;t trust you enough to take action on your ideas. When they rebuff your approach, they are telling you they do not believe you have their best interests at heart. There simply is no trust. The key to attaining your ideal clientele is the art of deliberately and sincerely building trust.&rdquo;How do you speak the language of trust? Bill believes it boils down to three things:</p><li> Know the right questions to ask, when to ask them and how to ask them.</li><li> Listen with empathy.</li><li> When it's your turn to talk to be able to make an offer or give advice that is relevant for them, with confidence and conviction, and in a way that tends to inspire action. <br/>  </li><p> What are some of the right questions to ask? In the beginning of a potential business relationship, the questions are open-ended and about things that are meaningful, important, significant and compelling to the client prospect. Questions like:</p><li> What's important to you?</li><li> What are you most passionate about? People? Causes?</li><li> What's more important in your life than money?</li><li> Who do you care about?</li><li> What are your aspirations for the future? <br/>  </li><p> Notice how the questions are oriented to draw out things that are positive and tend to stimulate positive emotions. Consider the positive orientation of these questions in contrast to how the old-school salesperson would tend to focus on questions that draw out problems and fears. Don't be a salesperson, be a trusted advisor.</p><p> Speaking the language of trust means that you ask questions where the answers inspire people about their futures, not scare them about the future. The better you understand what inspires people about the future, the more likely it is that they will feel good about you, even trust you. This puts you in a much better position to make an offer that might help them have the future they aspire to.</p><h3> Trust questions</h3><p> <br/> Building a system of trust is a process. Do you go deep enough in the questions you ask? Do you get deep enough emotionally? To do this, you ask clarifying and expanding questions in response to the answers you get from your initial meaningful, important, significant and compelling questions.</p><p> An effective clarifying question is, \"What do you mean by __________?\" An effective expanding question is, \"Tell me more about _______________.\" Clarifying questions provide more detail about their answers. Expanding questions give you more information about their answers.</p><p> As Bill Bachrach says, &ldquo;Impact questions are some of my favorite questions. They take what you have discovered during a conversation that's gone emotionally deep from someplace meaningful and bring it to a crescendo about the impact and results this will have on a client's life. Impact questions are questions like, \"And what impact will that have on your life?\" \"Once you have achieved ____________, what will be the result of that?\"</p><p> You have asked good questions, gone emotionally deep with clarifying, expanding and impact questions, and listened with empathy, so what do you do now? It's your turn to talk. And what will be music to their ears when you do speak is if you make them an offer or give them advice that is relevant for them. How do you know what's relevant for them? That's what you discovered while you were listening to the answers to all of your excellent questions.&rdquo; <br/> Create your consistent process to building trust and attract your new ideal clients.</p><p> One final question: As a financial advisor, would you like to increase the trust dial with your top clients and prospects? Would you like to enhance your process, including a well documented value promise, that you give to your best prospects? If the answer is yes, reach out to someone who can help you, or contact us.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If your department is undertaking a wide-sweeping marketing materials audit to identify stale messages and outdated figures, or if your firm is taking its marketing initiatives in a more digital direction, this five-step process will help you lead your team through this seemingly complicated process.</p><h3> Step 1: Setting your auditing goals</h3><p> <br/> Before jumping into writing and design, before you even begin hunting down all of your firm&rsquo;s old marketing materials, we recommend that you clearly define your goals. Why are you conducting the audit? How will the audit help your marketing initiatives going forward? Typical answers are:</p><li> &ldquo;We want our marketing materials to be relevant and have a longer life.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We want to lower our long-term marketing costs via fewer refreshes and fewer print runs.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We want our marketing materials to be read by a wider audience.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;We want to engage our clients and prospects in new ways.&rdquo; <br/>  </li><h3> Step 2: Create a content map</h3><p> <br/> Now that you&rsquo;ve clearly defined your goals, it&rsquo;s time to categorize and reprioritize your marketing materials.</p><p> Start by using the goals that you defined in Step 1 to determine your grouping methodology. Ways that are more traditional include grouping your materials by product or campaign. Lately, however, we&rsquo;ve seen a shift to grouping materials demographically or by life stage. For example, if you are trying to target millennials, you would list in a spreadsheet all the materials that apply to this cohort.</p><p> If you group materials demographically, you&rsquo;ll find that many of them apply to savers and investors at different life stages. Make sure these materials end up in both buckets. Why? When you rethink formats in Step 3, you may decide to deliver similar content in radically different formats depending on who you&rsquo;re engaging.</p><p> If you have analytics, think about refreshing your most used materials first.</p><h3> Step 3: Rethink formats</h3><p> <br/> It's 2016, there&rsquo;s a good chance the majority of the materials that you&rsquo;re auditing are print brochures. And there&rsquo;s an even better chance that your firm wants to take many of them in new digital directions. A marketing materials audit is the ideal time to have these discussions.</p><p> While you may simply update these brochures, keep in mind that infographics, microsites and online articles are all great ideas because they are engaging, sharable and easy to update, all of which deliver on the goals outlined in Step 1.</p><h3> Step 4: Audit your resources</h3><p> <br/> Is your team big enough to handle the updates and fill in the gaps that you identified? If the wide-ranging scope of a marketing materials audit seems too large, complex or time consuming, think about hiring a strategic content partner who can help create a strategy for your refreshed content.</p><p> If you need additional resources, make sure that your content partner has the product and industry knowledge to effectively round out your team.</p><h3> Step 5: Production</h3><p> <br/> Now that you know what marketing materials you have and which ones you want to refresh, it&rsquo;s time for your writers, designers and developers to get to work. Coordinating your resources is time consuming. But clear timelines and focused work &ndash; that is, strategically working through your list without running too many refreshes at once &ndash; will help your team deliver great results.</p><h3> Next steps</h3><p> <br/> Although a marketing materials audit will create some challenges, especially as your typical day-to-day responsibilities aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, following these five steps will ensure that this challenging and exciting initiative goes more smoothly.</p><p> If you want to read more about auditing your marketing materials, read our post on how to better  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/marketing-articles/audit-your-marketing-materials-to-better-align-with-your-sales-teams-efforts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  align your materials with your sales team </a> .</p>",

    "content": "<p> Finding a successor is a key component to any manager&rsquo;s long-term strategy. In the meantime, leaders will have to identify employees suited for managerial roles that crop up across their business or entire company. But it&rsquo;s not easy &mdash; even the most skilled employees in a certain position don&rsquo;t necessarily translate to management potential. Leaders have to look a little harder.</p><p> According to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/167975/why-great-managers-rare.aspx).\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup  </a> </u>  report &ldquo;Why Great Managers are Rare&rdquo;:</p><li> Nearly one in five of those currently in management roles demonstrate a high level of talent for managing others, and another one in five show a basic talent for it</li><li> These two stats combined contribute 48% higher profit to their companies than average managers do</li><li> Companies fail to choose the candidate best fit for the manager job 82% of the time <br/>  </li><p> If managers are so linked to profit potential, choosing the right leaders is crucial. But most of the time, that&rsquo;s not done. To help current managers out, there are three leadership qualities to look for in your existing talent base to find high potential management candidates &mdash; and every choice should have all three.</p><h3> <strong>  Aspiration: Wanting More, More, More </strong></h3><p> <br/> You can&rsquo;t force an employee into a management position if they don&rsquo;t want it. Some workers are happy with their current workload and work-life balance and don&rsquo;t want to disrupt what they have going. Even if they&rsquo;re the best employee you&rsquo;ve got, they&rsquo;re not the one you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p> Instead, you want the employees who volunteer for projects, who want to take on more responsibilities and accountability, who come up with new ideas, and who have expressed interest in their career track within your company. If you&rsquo;re not sure of who that candidate is, the easiest thing is to ask. Probe potential managers about their longer-term aspirations, how they&rsquo;d feel in a more senior, leadership role. Their attitude about the questions will be able to tell you your answer.</p><h3> <strong>  Ability: Knowing How to Get It Done </strong></h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t mistake ability for just job skill. This combines the personality and learned skills necessary for a leader. At the base level, yes, potential managers should be good at their jobs. But select a list of the top 10, 20, or whatever you might need, and then dig into these key personality traits they should have. Above all, watch how they interact with people &mdash; whether they&rsquo;re peers, interns, or bosses.</p><p> Identify your employees who have developed strong office relationships built on open communication, or who handle each customer with a natural grace and care. They should be motivational, but also they must be able to have an assertiveness. And in case it&rsquo;s not obvious, eliminate candidates that make decisions based strictly on office politics or who have minimal interpersonal skills.</p><h3> <strong>  Engagement: Living the Culture for the Long Term </strong></h3><p> <br/> If you promote a manager who then leaves the company after a few months, you haven&rsquo;t promoted the right manager. You need someone who (at least in plans) intends to stick around, for the sake of every worker underneath them on the totem pole.</p><p> To find these employees, of course look for the rational commitment to the company &mdash; are they moving soon? Have they discussed other career options? But just as important, look for people who have an emotional commitment to the company, who embody its values, and who participate in team events. Employees who understand and buy into organizational values are less likely to leave a company.</p><p> It takes a lot of time and resources to hire and train a manager, so your candidate selection is crucial to make sure they&rsquo;re the right fit for the job.</p>",

Disruptive brands in the consumer market like Uber, Airbnb, Spotify, Apple and Google bring change at lightning speed. Many consumers experience all kinds of changes &ndash; barring they consider it to be advantages or not &ndash; this reflects on the business world. How is technology changing social interaction? The way we maintain relationships and collaborate is influencing contractual relations and as a result the outcome of contracts. Contract management, especially the psychological contract, is defining the quality of a brand ecosystem.</p><p> The availability of information and technology developments enables true price transparency. It will originate, forecast, integrate and transcend the enterprise. What happens in the consumer related area concerning social interaction is happening in business to business as well. The underlying cause lies in the fact that interactions change. Technology is no longer &lsquo;just&rsquo; technology; it becomes a social platform. Not only between people, also between organisations, machines and across value chains. This effects all contractual relations, so we need to be aware of the fact that a successful business is about managing an ecosystem, not individual contracts. Procurement, as classical price pusher, and sales, as classical storyteller, won&rsquo;t be the defining factors anymore. Future businesses are depending on integrated value creation.</p><p> The deployment of contract management as mechanism to manage your world around you on a strategic level has a leading role in building and managing your brand ecosystem. What influences are driving these changes and how do we make our businesses futureproof for the new age?</p><h3> The six drivers of change <br/>  </h3><p> <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/6-drivers-of-change.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Six drivers of changer | Contract Management\" src=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/6-drivers-of-change-1024x624.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> What causes interactions to change so disruptively? Not only technology, but also the social and environmental need to create a better, sustainable world. Here are the drivers of change that will shape our future the next ten years.</p><h3> <strong>  Longevity </strong></h3><p> <br/> Technology and science have developed better healthcare over the years. This has brought forth extreme longevity. By 2025 the number of people who are over the age of 60 will be increased by 70%. Today&rsquo;s business relationships are mostly focussed on relatively short term goals. Longevity requires a focus on maintaining long-term relationships as people will be looking differently to brands. This also means that a continuous change and focus must be part of any strategy and any ecosystem..</p><h3> <strong>  New media </strong></h3><p> <br/> New communication tools need more than only text related media. The increase of available digital tools provides us with quick and efficient instruments to connect, educate and direct people. Visual communication is becoming a new universal language. As a manager of a brand ecosystem you need to be constantly aware of how you are perceived and how you perform.</p><h3> <strong>  Computational world </strong></h3><p> <br/> Fast developments in sensors and processing turn the world into a programmable system. Big data gives us the ability to see things on a larger scale. It encompasses algorithms, systems and processes that can review, analyse and present information in a more meaningful form. This supports organisations or end-users in acting appropriately and proactively upon (un)foreseen circumstances.</p><h3> <strong>  Global connection </strong></h3><p> <br/> The internet makes the world a &lsquo;smaller place&rsquo;. It enables people and organisations to bridge long distance relationships and to outsource activities to any country in the world. Ecosystems will cross borders. US and Europe have no longer the monopoly in job creation, innovation and political power. This places diversity and adaptability at the centre of operations. In each ecosystem you must be able to cope with cross cultural differences and timing, more than ever before in history.</p><h3> <strong>  Social tools in business </strong></h3><p> <br/> Social tools are allowing organisations to work at extreme scales. It strengthens the global connection. New ways of production and value creation will spring to life through social technology. It is not just about collaboration across time zones anymore.  <u>  <a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/beta-test\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Beta testing  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"https://sparknlaunch.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/ghetto-testing-the-viability-of-an-idea/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ghetto testing  </a> </u>  approaches, rapid testing with the marketplace play crucial roles. In certain cases also delivering co-creating and co-developing is part of the added-value of social tools.</p><h3> <strong>  Smart machines and systems </strong></h3><p> <br/> The introduction of robotics and workplace automation will  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/labour-market/how-robotics-and-human-skills-can-collaborate-succesfully/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   take over repetitive jobs  </a> </u> . This technology will help people to focus on what&rsquo;s important and gives them the ability to augment and extend their capabilities.</p><h3> The solidarity effect on contractual relations</h3><p> <br/> These technological developments will not only change the way we work and interact socially, but will also implicate contractual relations. Growth will thrive best when working together towards a joint goal. In order to mitigate the implications of disruptive initiatives, businesses need to elaborate on what insights and skills are required in the new, digital age. Furthermore, it is important to realise how it changes to whole concept of doing business and maintaining partnerships. The advantages of creating stuff together will become more evident. A shift from pre-award to post-award focus will take place as a logical consequence of increasing output based collaborations. To meet market demands steering towards co-creation and co-value driven long-term investment is crucial. As a business pivot, contract management will revolve around managing long-term relationships, not just managing contracts. The huge impact on the business role of contract managers is depending on their level of empathy and relationship management skills.</p><h3> Psychological contract</h3><p> <br/> In most organisations the psychological contract is yet to be fully defined and understood. It&rsquo;s far from widespread recognised and used in organisations. This is an important next step in building brand ecosystems, because it sets the dynamics for relationships and defines the practicality of the work to be done. Successful contracts depend on human behaviour; managing expectations is key in the set of behavioural values. The psychological contract develops and evolves constantly based on (the lack of) communication and the unwritten expectations of the relationship as distinct from the formal contract. Qualities like respect, compassion, trust, empathy, fairness and objectivity characterise this psychological contract. Perceived interruption of the psychological contract can severely damage a relationship, but perceived loyalty will lead to engagement and an increase of productivity.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/moral-compass.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Moral compass | Contract Management\" src=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/moral-compass.jpg\"/> </a></p><h3> Building a brand ecosystem for a healthy business</h3><p> <br/> <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/leiderschap/businesses-of-the-future-understanding-business-ecosystems/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Building and managing an ecosystem  </u> </a>  requires businesses to look beyond contracts and suppliers and a solid moral compass the organisation is loyal to. Co-creation can only thrive in an ecosystem that connects parties that live by the same principles. An example of an organisation that has successfully built a brand ecosystem is a company called  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/mens\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Under Armour  </a> </u> . Learning from their journey, what could be an effective strategy to establish a productive ecosystem? In five short steps:</p><li> Look around and learn from industry innovators.</li><li> Say farewell to your product centric approach, extend to a content centric approach.</li><li> Forget monopolies, forge the perfect partnerships.</li><li> Loose the inward pattern of thinking, help customers to build a lifestyle.</li><li> Develop industry changing initiatives that create thought leadership. <br/>  </li><p> Building a brand ecosystem is a continuous process that will always be subject to change. Agility, output and the psychological contract will always be leading in that process.</p><p> So, what drives a successful contractual relationship in the future?</p><h3> Partnership in the year 2025</h3><p> <br/> Contract management is requiring a more human interface. Whether its B2B, B2C or C2B business, dealing with the psychological part of a contract becomes crucial, because it specifically concerns mutual expectations of inputs and outcomes. Compassion, trust, respect, fairness, empathy and objectivity; they are all currencies that evaluate and enhance the embracing of the drivers of change. How these currencies are applied in relationships determines the intensity of each partnership and contract.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/currency-of-psychological-contract.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Currency of psychological Contract | Contract Management\" src=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/currency-of-psychological-contract-1024x575.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Practise what you preach: cultural behaviour should be guided by governance from the top. The behaviour of leaders &ndash; the tone from the top &ndash; sets the tone for overall organisational conduct and the way people within the organisation interact with third parties. This is an important foundation of a brand ecosystem. Within the framework for good governance re-innovating existing partnerships will help set the outlines for high quality relationship management, co-creation and co-value driven long-term investment.</p><p> Bringing the existing partnerships to a higher, more human level is precedent over new sourcing. To ensure every partnership is delivering excellent mutual results, an effective framework should also cover information governance on big data strategy and decision support in order to manage contracts to the full extent.</p><p> <strong>  Above all: think big, start small and act fast! </strong></p> ",

    "content": "<p> As mentioned I&rsquo;ve just attended #Money2020Europe where 4,000 folks gathered to listen to great speakers like me.  Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t get long to stay at the show for various reasons, but did pick up a magazine about Copenhagen as a FinTech hub.1  Everywhere wants to be a FinTech hub, now that the scene is so active and key.  Not everywhere will be a hub, as only so many places can offer the right capabilities.  For example, it was interesting talking with Jon Weiner the co-founder of Money2020, who lives in Lisbon and was telling me about their leading tech capabilities.  Do they have a FinTech centre in Lisbon? I asked, as I&rsquo;d never heard of one.  No, Jon said.  Unsurprising as Lisbon isn&rsquo;t really a Global Financial Centre.So you would expect the world&rsquo;s global financial centres to encourage and nurture FinTech.  In the latest Z/Yen Global Financial Centres Index (issue #19,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.longfinance.net/programmes/financial-centre-futures/global-financial-centres-index/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   March 2016  </a> </u> ), London, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo comprise the top 5.  Intriguingly, the first three are very actively building their FinTech capabilities but, having been in Hong Kong and Tokyo recently, I know they are more challenged.  For example, a colleague at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi presented this slide in the FinTech forum I attended there: <a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/JapanFintech.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"JapanFintech\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/JapanFintech-1024x895.jpg?3226c1\"/> </a> This is Japan&rsquo;s FinTech scene and it&rsquo;s tiny, compared with London and New York.KPMG&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kpmg.com/BE/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/the-pulse-of-fintech.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Pulse of FinTech 2015  </a> </u>  report illustrates the challenge further, showing that US FinTech leads the world.  Of the $13.8 billion invested by Venture Capital firms in FinTech in 2015, $7.39 billion went into US start-ups, compared with $4.5 billion into Asian firms and just $1.5 billion in European organisations.</p><h3> <strong>  The 10 largest FinTech funding rounds in America, 2015 </strong></h3><a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/America-KPMG.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"America KPMG\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/America-KPMG-1024x566.jpg?3226c1\"/></a><h3> <strong>  The 10 largest FinTech funding rounds in Europe, 2015 </strong></h3><a href=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Europe-KPMG.jpg?3226c1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Europe KPMG\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Europe-KPMG-1024x583.jpg?3226c1\"/></a><h3> <strong>  The 10 largest FinTech funding rounds in Asia, 2015 </strong></h3><img alt=\"Asia KPMG\" src=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asia-KPMG-1024x597.jpg?3226c1\"/>So what does it take to truly become a FinTech hub?Well, going back to Copenhagen, my friends at CFIR commissioned Oxford Research and Rainmaking Innovation to find out the answer.  The resulting <a href=\"https://copenhagenfintech.dk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CPH-FINtech-Hub_Summery-Report..pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> research report</a> concludes that there are six key factors for becoming a FinTech hub:<h3> 1. A vibrant FinTech startup community:</h3>At the grass root level, there needs to be a lot of events and activities going on, which can help the establishment and growth of start-ups.<h3> 2. Active established players:</h3>It is crucial that large established FinTech players invest in innovation and in leveraging the FinTech potential &ndash; start-ups cannot build a world class FinTech hub alone.<h3> 3. Access to risk capital:</h3>The access to risk capital is critical to fund the establishment and growth of innovative companies.<h3> 4. Political support and &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; regulator:</h3>Central public bodies need to support the FinTech sector and announce their support publicly, and regulators need to change from a reactive to a more proactive and collaborative mindset.<h3> 5. Access to talent:</h3>FinTech is a knowledge intensive sector highly dependent on access to high skilled specialised labour.<h3> 6. Brand as a FinTech hub:</h3>To attract international talent, investors, businesses, etc. One needs to build a brand as an important FinTech hub.So there you go.  If you want to be a FinTech hub, you need finance, government, regulators and technologists to work side-by-side to make it happen, which is why I keep saying that London has <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2014/07/fintech-is-the-place-to-be-and-so-is-london.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> the upper hand</a>, because we are side-by-side.",

The pain when reality hits can be far greater&hellip;</p><p> <strong>  Samantha, 33, considered herself pretty savvy. </strong> She was an up and coming graphic designer who was starting to get noticed. &ldquo;I borrowed money from my parents to invest in a tech IPO that my stockbroker (or was it a friend?) assured me was a guaranteed winner. He called this stock &lsquo;a can&rsquo;t miss innovation&rsquo; and insisted that I stood to make a big score. Now I have nothing but worthless securities and a debt to my parents that I cannot repay. I feel miserable about it!&rdquo; </p><p> <strong>  Carla, 55, was a successful entrepreneur and rarely made serious errors. </strong> The letter she held in her hand explained that the limited partnership in which she had invested was in trouble. They needed to raise capital or the venture could be lost entirely. And, there was no guarantee that the additional funds would turn the project from disaster to success. &ldquo;The guy who sold me this thing pointed to all the past successes of these guys. He showed me the projected income from the project, the benefits and set an expectation of a great deal. He was quick to point out that he had several other people who were anxious to take this unit if I passed, so he had to know soon. It seemed like a no-brainer. Wow, big mistake!&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Janet, 62, clutched the life insurance illustration in her hands. </strong> &ldquo;The agent told me that I&rsquo;d only have to pay for ten years, then the cash would accumulate and I&rsquo;d be able to use the money for retirement. But last week I got a notice that I need to start paying into the policy or it could collapse. I bought it based on his illustration showing all the cash that would be in there&mdash;and now there&rsquo;s nothing. I am really mad!&rdquo; </p><p> What these examples have in common is the lack of knowledge each possessed when they made their decisions&mdash;and how much they relied on those selling the products to give them good information. Unfortunately, they were only told the features and benefits of making such a decision. Somehow the possible pitfalls or downside were left unexplored.</p><p> Our greed factor&mdash;and yes, we all have one&mdash;is hungry to hear the upside and the possibilities of future success. We don&rsquo;t want to focus on the downside; after all, like buying a lottery ticket, you have to put your money down to win.</p><p> But the playing field is not level. These purchasers did not have the expertise or foresight to even ask the right questions&mdash;making them an easy mark for anyone with a great pitch and shiny brochure. They are otherwise smart people&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that they received a shot of adrenaline with every thought of a big score. Their internal fantasy runs the show and keeps them from digging down to the cold hard truth.</p><p> We are inundated by companies promising (or at the very least alluding to) stellar results. Mutual fund companies are delighted when their funds are given 5 Star ratings from Morningstar&mdash;they&rsquo;re then widely distributed and promoted. But when the fund falls out of favor, which is almost inevitable as the market changes, they&rsquo;ll promote the newest fad fund instead.</p><p> And they are quite happy to have you sell off Fund A in favor of Fund B. So instead of creating a long-term allocation that will have normal ups and downs, you&rsquo;ll perpetuate a manic chase of the latest and greatest 5 Star funds.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s face it, most buyers are not going to delve this deeply&mdash;who has the time and interest in devoting hours to trying to parse truth from the tangle of slick marketing and celebrity endorsements?</p><p> And yet, unlike Samantha, Carla and Janet, you want to activate that part of you that demands full information, complete disclosure and a reasonable statement of risk. Isn&rsquo;t it better to know the truth up front than let it slam you in the face when you least expect it?</p>",

    "title": "5 “Future\" Considerations for the 30-Something Advisor",
    "link": "5-future-considerations-for-the-30-something-advisor",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> You are a 35-40 year old advisor who is 10-15 years out of your firm&rsquo;s training program and you&rsquo;ve built a quality and thriving business. <br/>  </h3><p> You have strong, personal client relationships and have amassed $100-$125MM in AUM. You are the best of the industry&rsquo;s next generation. There&rsquo;s no question that you can stay the course as what you have done so far has delivered an enviable level of success and has well positioned you for the future. But you are forward-thinking and want to plan for this next chapter in your professional life. You are most definitely being wooed by every firm in the area, as well as likely being approached by multiple advisors, both at your own firm and elsewhere, to join forces.</p><p> With the very high-class but very real challenge of having so many options before you, what should you be considering? Here are 5 to start with:</p><h3> 1. Do It on Your Own <br/>  </h3><p> If you believe that what got you to this point will continue to work for you and allow you to reach your next goals and beyond, why mess with success? Nonetheless, it makes sense to look to build your own vertical team, with you at the head. You may at most be only 40, but you will need time to find and mentor the right successor. And as your clients grow in size and you add new relationships, it will be more and more challenging to continue to provide the same high-level of service. This vertical team model allows you to retain control and autonomy but may leave you feeling at a loss when it comes to being mentored yourself. It also creates the additional responsibilities associated with managing a team and has the potential to take you away from client service and business development&mdash;the very things that you may value most and have been responsible for your success thus far.</p><h3> 2. Emergency back-up <br/>  </h3><p> If you are not interested in forming a partnership, or you haven&rsquo;t yet found the right partner, there may still be a need for back-up. You may always prefer to remain on your own, but some things are out of your control and you need a plan just in case you are hit by the proverbial bus. Perhaps you just want peace of mind when you are out of the office. Entering an arrangement whereby you and a trusted colleague provide limited scope coverage for each other without otherwise creating a partnership may be a viable solution. While there is no commitment that this will develop into a more traditional partnership, it can serve as a trial period allowing you to further evaluate whether there is greater potential.</p><h3> 3. A partnership of equals <br/>  </h3><p> If you are beginning to feel challenged in your efforts to be all things to your clients and welcome the idea of partnering to add expertise, the exchange of ideas and share client coverage, you may consider forming a partnership with a peer. If you are fortunate enough to be with a firm where you have a community of like-minded advisors who are at a comparable stage in their careers, you may have a choice in building a horizontal team. You certainly need to address the compatibility of clients, business style, values and goals. Since you have operated up until now as a lone wolf, it will be an adjustment to run the business in tandem. You must define how decisions will be made and how clients and fees will be split, both with new relationships and those that each member brings to the table. And most importantly, you must be willing to compromise. Keep in mind that what you gain in bench strength for clients must outweigh what you give up in autonomy. Since partners also take on each other&rsquo;s weaknesses and challenges, the value must clearly outweigh the costs.</p><h3> 4. Become the successor <br/>  </h3><p> At 40 years of age and with a $125mm book giving you credibility, you are in the sweet spot for every advisor 50 and above who needs to identify his own successor. You won&rsquo;t need to go in search of a senior advisor; they are likely reaching out to you with promises that you will experience exponential growth when you eventually take over their book of business. Given the aging of the advisor population these opportunities abound, but is this type of move right for you? How much of your autonomy must you sacrifice in order to make the partnership work? Is there a certainty that the senior advisor will retire by a certain date? How is the business to operate in the meantime; that is, do you keep your clients and production separate? Will you be introduced to your partner&rsquo;s clients to ensure a smooth transition and strong retention of assets? What is the impact on your freedom to leave the firm if you should want to in the future? These questions are just some of the considerations that must be addressed before you make this commitment.</p><h3> 5. Going in search of greener pastures <br/>  </h3><p> Some next gen advisors may see an opportunity to monetize on the success they have achieved so far by entertaining an offer from another firm and capitalizing on their future growth while they are still in strong growth mode. Alternatively, others at this stage of their careers may be inspired to evolve from employee to business owner and pursue some version of independence. You have sufficient experience and scale to consider building something. With a long runway still ahead of you, it&rsquo;s important to ask yourself how confident you are in your firm for the future. Will you continue to grow the way you want and to serve your clients as you feel you should? Most advisors recognize that it makes sense to move once in their careers, and the next gen advisor who can be both successor and team leader, and business builder and buyer, is uniquely positioned to consider that one well timed move.</p><h3> Reaching the Crossroads <br/>  </h3><p> So here you are: You have built a successful business, overcoming odds that have made it more challenging than ever before to establish one&rsquo;s self as an advisor. You&rsquo;ve proven yourself, earning the right to take charge of what comes next in your business life; don&rsquo;t allow your firm, a partner, or circumstances to call the next shots. It&rsquo;s your opportunity to make your own choice and ensure that you choose a path that allows you to build upon your life&rsquo;s work. Take this time to consider your options carefully, as the path you choose is likely one you will follow through the rest of your career.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<h3> The days are now longer, the birds are singing and the pollen count is off the charts. <br/>  </h3><p> Yes, spring has finally sprung, although I&rsquo;m not sure some of my friends who woke up to snow today would agree. It&rsquo;s funny how just the thought of this season brings with it smiles and optimism even though it&rsquo;s just another date on the calendar. I, however, love any excuse to be able to impart some wisdom on why you need to care about engaging your employees.</p><p> It&rsquo;s hard to remain &lsquo;down in the dumps&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s so beautiful outside but when you work eight to ten hours a day, many times in a windowless work environment and don&rsquo;t have time for lunch, you don&rsquo;t always notice the beauty of what&rsquo;s going on around you. This is especially true for people who have literally quit in their chairs, while still physically present in the workplace.  It&rsquo;s time to shake the rust off these folks with some spring-cleaning. </p><p> Here are some ideas that I&rsquo;ve gotten from managers and a few I&rsquo;ve tried myself that just might work:</p><li> <p>  Carve out a Friday where no meetings are allowed to be scheduled and call it a &lsquo;clean up&rsquo; day. Bring in those really large garbage and recycle bins and place them in a central part of the work environment. The goal of the day is to encourage everyone to clean out their workspaces and throw out stuff that&rsquo;s not necessary and bogging them down. It&rsquo;s amazing how a clean desk can bring you joy! </p></li><li> <p>  Throw a potluck International lunch where everyone is encouraged to bring in a dish that represents his or her particular heritage. Not only will it be delicious, but it will also be a great way to celebrate diversity. </p></li><li> <p>  Support wellness initiatives in the workplace, whether it is weight loss, smoking cessation, fitness or the like. Your employees need to know that you care about them as people first and foremost. </p></li><li> <p>  Put up a whiteboard or corkboard in a central location and post only one rule: no gripes or badmouthing allowed. This is a recognition graffiti board whose sole purpose is to encourage people to share their thanks or kudos for others in the workplace. </p></li><li> <p>  Hold a town hall meeting and bring all your employees together in one place (and don&rsquo;t forget to link in your remote workers) to do the following: </p></li><li> <p>  Provide an update on the state of the business including financials </p></li><li> <p>  Talk about your top three strategic business imperatives for the coming year </p></li><li> <p>  Invite 2-3 mid level business leaders to educate the organization on a new product introduction, project update or cross-functional work team for example. It&rsquo;s a great way to recognize their work and get others excited about things going on in the organization </p></li><li> <p>  Leave plenty of time for a robust Q&amp;A session, including some that come in anonymously in advance as well as in-the-moment ones </p></li><li> <p>  Always remember to provide the &lsquo;why behind the what&rsquo; and give context rather than just information </p></li><li> <p>  Create an environment where FUN is a welcome cornerstone to your foundation upon which culture and engagement can thrive. </p></li><p> It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of resources, both time and dollars, to create an engaging culture. It is all about getting back to basics, and simply connecting with your employees. It&rsquo;s the little things that mean the most when you treat people with respect.  It&rsquo;s always great to remember that we are not human resources, nor human capital, but rather we are all just human beings. Let&rsquo;s spring forward with this in mind.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> When was the last time you gave yourself a promotion? <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re a business owner, this question might seem a little odd. After all, you&rsquo;re the boss. There&rsquo;s not really a next level, is there?</p><p> But there is.</p><p> As an advice business grows, many advisers unknowingly fail to get rid of tasks that really should be done by junior staff. The analogy I&rsquo;ve found useful here is one shared with me by a mentor of mine.</p><p> As a kid growing up in the 80&rsquo;s, I was, as many kids were, obsessed with the Space Shuttle. As you&rsquo;ll probably be aware, it&rsquo;s hard to get something as big as the Shuttle into space. Gravity doesn&rsquo;t co-operate.</p><p> So the Shuttle needs to carry massive amounts of fuel, stored inside giant booster tanks, just to escape the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p><p> As it goes up, the fuel in the booster rockets starts to exhaust. Eventually, it reaches a point where it&rsquo;s the Shuttle doing the carrying, rather than the rockets doing the lifting.</p><p> At this point, it does the only thing it can logically do; jettison the rockets, and continue its journey into space.</p><p> Your business has booster rockets.</p><p> There are things you did at the beginning which were absolutely vital for you to get started. They may have included marketing, admin, bookkeeping and other tasks only you knew how to do. You may have done them simply because you didn&rsquo;t have the money or the knowledge to outsource them.</p><h3> Do you continue to try and do these same tasks as you grow? <br/>  </h3><p> If you did, adding in new tasks and responsibilities as your business grows and expands, you&rsquo;d soon find yourself in a situation that many advisers now face. In other words, swamped, overwhelmed, and with no time left for the things you really should be doing.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a reality that often advisors put off the things which really matter, such as seeing clients, building referral sources, working on new marketing strategies, developing new offers or even working out systems and processes and a business model behind it all, instead focusing on completing tasks as they come into the inbox and workflow.</p><p> It&rsquo;s understandable, but it&rsquo;s classic big rocks failure. If you just focus on the sand (i.e. small admin tasks, your e-mail inbox, your calendar), you end up with no time left for the important stuff. Your big rocks.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the solution? <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s pretty simple. Get a whiteboard or a big sheet of paper. Make a list of all the tasks you undertake on a regular basis in your business.</p><p> Make sure you cover all categories. Include the marketing tasks, the stuff to do with new clients, the stuff to do with managing ongoing clients, admin and more.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve done it, identify the ones that if you&rsquo;re able to focus on, would add maximum value to your business. These are the things that if there was nothing else around, you would focus your time on, because it&rsquo;s going to generate the best results. Highlight this with one colour.</p><p> Then, be brutal and ask yourself an open question. If money was no object, if the right resources were available, what could I potentially get someone else to do?</p><p> This could be someone you employ, it could be an outsourced provider or partner, it could be a virtual assistant, or it even could be putting in place technology that would do the same thing just as well or even better.</p><p> Now, if you&rsquo;re on the right track, you&rsquo;ll start to notice that anywhere from 20% to 30% of your role as a business owner/ adviser is the stuff that really generates results and you love. Meanwhile, anything from 30% to 60% is stuff that other people could conceivably do.</p><h3> Your challenge now is to decide what you outsource or delegate first <br/>  </h3><p> I&rsquo;ll give you a tip. Choose the stuff that happens most frequently. Stuff you do daily, or weekly, or monthly. These are the low hanging fruit where, if you can eliminate them, you can claim back most time.</p><p> Choose two systems that you can outsource immediately. Video record an instructional video using screen capture software. Give the tasks over to someone else.</p><p> Next month maybe choose three others. The following month choose five.</p><p> Make this a habit and you&rsquo;ll find yourself very quickly leveraging your ability to make a difference in your own business.</p><p> Business owners that go through this usually suddenly realize they&rsquo;ve been doing things for a while, simply out of habit. They connect with the idea that the time for owning those tasks has passed.</p><p> Once you set yourself free from this, you&rsquo;ll realize that growing your business at an expedited rate isn&rsquo;t about the things you do to bring clients in, or the things you do in order to service existing clients.</p><p> Often, it&rsquo;s more about the things you choose to no longer do.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> One area many sales reps struggle in is how to requalify existing accounts, or prospects they haven&rsquo;t spoken with in a while. Let&rsquo;s first establish the need to do this, and we&rsquo;ll address exactly how to do it. <br/>  </h3><p> First let&rsquo;s acknowledge that all things change. In fact, someone once said that the only thing that doesn&rsquo;t change is change itself. It&rsquo;s constant. And that means that just because a prospect or client was in charge of a certain function last month or 6 months ago, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are in charge of it today.</p><p> In addition to their duties changing, their areas of responsibilities change also. Someone who was responsible for handling lead flow may now also be in charge of ordering those leads. Or someone who was responsible for one area of the business (and ordering) may have given that responsibility to someone else.</p><p> The bottom line is that it&rsquo;s important to do more than just, &ldquo;Oh hi, just calling to see if you need anything?&rdquo; Today, it&rsquo;s important that you requalify the person you&rsquo;re speaking with and try to find as many opportunities as possible to sell your product or service.</p><p> One of the biggest problems sales reps have is knowing how to transition into requalifying. The resistance I get from sales reps is, &ldquo;But I spoke with him three months ago! I already know what he does.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answer. &ldquo;But how many times have you found that things have changed since then?&rdquo;</p><p> If you&rsquo;re honest, the answer is it changes all the time.</p><p> So what you need to begin the requalifying process is a good transition sentence, a soft approach, so you can begin requalifying and get the updated information that often makes the difference between a successful call and one that results in nothing at all.</p><p> Here are some examples of transition sentences. Remember to adapt them to fit your personality, your product and service:</p><p> <strong>  Transition sentence one: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;________, since it has been a few months since we&rsquo;ve spoken, let me just make sure my information is correct. Besides yourself, who else handles&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> [This is an assumptive way to find other decision makers in the company&hellip;]</p><p> <strong>  Transition sentence two: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;___________, let me get up to date on things with you. I know that last time we spoke you said you handled (X); what else are you responsible for these days?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Transition sentence three: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;Because things change all the time, let me just ask you a couple of quick questions to make sure I&rsquo;m up on things on your end. For example, what other products are you handing these days?&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  Transition sentence four: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;___________ I&rsquo;m updating the information on all my accounts this month &ndash; do you mind if I just verify a few things?</p><p> Great! What is your current extension?</p><p> How about your direct phone number? Cell? Email?</p><p> And are you still the only contact for all the printing needs there?</p><p> What other things are you handling?</p><p> How about other departments &ndash; who would I want to speak with&hellip;</p><p> How about your need for (X) &ndash; where have you been sourcing that these days?</p><p> What would you need to see from us to begin placing an order for that also?</p><p> [I&rsquo;m sure you can think of more&hellip;]</p><p> <strong>  Transition sentence five: </strong></p><p> &ldquo;_________, I know the last time we spoke you told me you handled (X), is that still correct?</p><p> Great. What else are you in charge of?</p><p> How are you handling your (XYZ)?</p><p> What other departments are handling the (ABC&rsquo;s)?</p><p> And what other products are you in charge of?</p><p> And remind me again of the decision process there?</p><p> How about timeline?</p><p> And besides yourself, who else would weigh in on this?</p><p> And so on&hellip;</p><p> As you can see, just because you think you know something about someone, you can still learn more. Think about it: When was the last time you were able to thoroughly qualify someone on the very first call? It probably took a few, didn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> When you use these kinds of requalifying questions, you&rsquo;ll be in a much better position to completely qualify an opportunity. And that can only lead to more business.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> As professional money managers our opinion is that: if you haven&rsquo;t already done so, it&rsquo;s important to develop or review and fine tune your portfolio&rsquo;s risk management plan.</h3><p> <br/> History tells us the relative calm of the last few years is not very likely to remain. Better to be prepared for some stormy weather. ETFs can play a key role in any portfolio defense strategy. </p><p> The most basic component of risk management has always been diversification. ETFs are a low-cost way to achieve it in any portfolio. In addition to funds that are indexed against total markets or industry categories, ETFs also offer a wide range of asset classes, from commodities (and futures) to precious metals, REITs and more.</p><p> As most properly diversified portfolios include investments in foreign stocks and bonds, exchange rates can present formidable risk. There are several ways to effectively hedge against currency risk, but their complexity often inhibits the average investor from using them properly. Currency ETFs present much simpler, more flexible and more liquid tools in an effort to hedge against the exchange rate risk of assets held in depreciating currencies. An investor should keep in mind, however, that the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes in the currency rates or exchange control regulations. </p><h3> ETFs may also be useful in mitigating a portfolio from certain other specific risks.</h3><p> <br/> For instance, short-term bond ETFs can reduce the stress of rising interest rates on other types of investments.</p><p> Finally, shorting techniques, long popular with many traders of individual stocks, are also available in ETF form. They can help protect a portfolio without necessitating selling holdings and so they save investors from accompanying transaction costs. Short ETFs should be considered short-term tactics, however. Any swift rise in market volatility can upset their balance and shatter that mirror image. Short selling is, however, a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short.</p><p> Net-net: we believe the best advice is to use a basket of risk management tools, such as ETFs, applying the right tool to the right portfolio &ldquo;danger zone&rdquo; &mdash; and at the right time.</p><p> To learn more about FlexShares visit us <a href=\"http://blog.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-risk-management-buzzword-post-40416\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p> ",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The baby boomer generation, those born from 1946 to 1964, has reached retirement age. <br/>  </h3><p> Until recently, the boomer generation made up the largest employee group now that they are retiring, leaving a gap in the workforce. Millennials aged 18 to 34 will outnumber the boomers starting this year, but they can&rsquo;t replace the experience that boomers take with them into retirement.</p><p> Insurance Journal reports that the share of Americans in the workforce is at its lowest in four decades. For the two years ending in 2013, 80 percent of the drop in the labor force was due to retirement. Even with the rebound in the economy the number of boomers exiting the workforce has remain unchanged since 2011.</p><p> Many older workers have stopped looking for jobs and others are finding new work opportunities in other areas. According to the AARP, one in three boomers is still in the workforce, but 35 percent have turned to a different career.</p><p> So why are boomers leaving the workforce, and what can businesses do to stop the knowledge drain.</p><h3> The Factors Behind the Boomer Exodus <br/>  </h3><p> Baby boomers don&rsquo;t necessarily want to retire. In fact, research shows that fewer boomers are retiring because of economic uncertainty and changes in the workplace. The recession forced many to delay retirement to rebuild savings, and more jobs are knowledge-based so older workers can stay on the job longer.</p><p> However, boomers also look at their jobs differently. Millennials are entering the workforce in droves, and many of them are assuming management roles alongside Generation X. Boomers now find themselves reporting to managers the same age as their children. In addition, some boomers have trouble keeping pace with the latest technology; the same technology that Millennials have been weaned on.</p><p> Baby boomers often find themselves at odds with younger employees in the workplace. Boomers have a different sense of corporate loyalty, a different style of communication and a different perspective on the workplace. Where Millennials expect total transparency and rapid advancement, boomers still expect to be rewarded for hard work and promoted based on corporate commitment and personal achievement. When these corporate generations clash, older workers often start looking for the exit.</p><h3> Boomers Departure Impacts Business <br/>  </h3><p> The baby boomer exodus is having a profound effect on American business. When they retire, the knowledge they have accumulated walks out the door with them, and the new generation of workers have to start from scratch, without learning from older mentors.</p><p> Businesses can apply a number of strategies to offset the brain drain and keep the boomers around as useful contributors to the business:</p><li> Be more flexible &ndash; Give older workers flexible hours, better health benefits, and other incentives to get them to stay.</li><li> Create a new role for older workers &ndash; Give older workers responsibility to act as mentors and train new employees. Acknowledge their contribution and ask them to pass on their expertise.</li><li> Offer consulting work &ndash; Many older workers don&rsquo;t want to retire but they do want more time to spend with their family. Consider offering older workers part-time or consulting work so you can retain their expertise without paying a full-time salary.</li><p> Businesses have to find ways to now accommodate the aging workforce. Keeping experienced employees on the job longer lets you take advantage of their experience, pass that expertise along, and eliminate the challenge of filling the gaps with less experienced employees.</p>",

    "content": "<h3>Goodbye 7, hello 3.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt&#39;s commonly known that after several years of relationship problems, couples experience the &#39;7 year itch&#39; and seek couples counseling in an attempt to repair their relationship. Often times its too late and their relationship eventually dissolves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>But, it appears the tide has changed and the 7 year itch has been dethroned and replaced with the 3-4 year itch.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Helen <a href=\"http://www.helenfisher.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Fisher </a> (Biological Anthropologist and total guru on the biology of love) states that &ldquo;perhaps its no coincidence that the American divorce peak corresponds perfectly with the normal duration of infatuation - two to three years.&quot; Further, this 3-4 year itch is biologically aligned with having children.&quot; As it turns out, the standard period of human birth spacing was originally four years. We were built to have our children four years apart and I think that this drive to pair up and stay together at least four years evolved millions of years ago so that a man and a woman would be drawn together and stay together, tolerate each other, at least long enough to rear a single child through infancy.&quot; And so it goes. And often times so does the marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our fast-driven, &lsquo;I want it now&rsquo; society in which we live, people have an expectation that relationships should be how they appear on television. They aren&rsquo;t. People expect their spouse to be &#39;the one for everything&#39; and thus depend on them to a degree that no person could ever attain. They will not. People expect their relationship will always be fun filled, sexually driven, and exciting. It will not. They believe their relationship should be like it was in the first couple of years of a relationship and that just &lsquo;being together will be enough.&rsquo; It will not. That the &lsquo;business part of any marriage - finances, bills, kids - are avoidable. It is not. Love, like life, is up and down. Fun days peppered with boring days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, these misguided expectations become a fantasy that no healthy relationship can compete with and is often correlated with feeling antsy in the relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, before you &#39;scratch that itch&#39;, consider this: according to <a href=\"http://www.gottman.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> John Gottman </a> , there are many things a couple can start to do that can help put their marriage back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Start a dialogue about the problems in your marriage&mdash;gently, without blame. </strong> Begin with a soft start-up &ndash; for example, &lsquo;is this a good time to talk? or &lsquo;when might be a good time to talk?&#39;.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Just because you think it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to say it. </strong> Sometimes you should listen to your inside voice and &lsquo;edit yourself.&rsquo; Some things are better left unsaid.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Find a marital therapist. Couples wait, on average, 6- 7 years before they get help. </strong> By then, they are hanging on by a thread and have said mean and destructive things to their partner that oftentimes causes irreparable damage.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Men benefit from accepting influence from their wife. </strong> Women do this naturally and so it benefits the couple as a whole if the man can do this, too.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t let arguments get out of control. </strong> The key to this is having healthy and effective repair habits. This helps keep the argument to a minimum. A couple&rsquo;s ability to change the topic, add some humor to diffuse the tension and the letting it go (backing down or reaffirming you are a team and in it together, is important.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Say positive things to one another. </strong> Gottman stresses the 5:1 ratio - happy couples make at least five times as many positive comments about their marriage than negative ones.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Look inward. </strong> Growth within the marriage occurs when each person looks inward and examines how to they contribute &ndash; or not - to the relationship. Doing this examines what their part is to the &lsquo;marital dance&rsquo; and what changes each person needs to make to strengthen the marriage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, these are not guarantees that your marriage will survive but small steps become bigger steps that often turn into greater growth for both people as well as the couple. And taking steps now can put you on a path of marriage recovery with greater clarity and awareness.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing/biographies/richard-turnill\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Richard Turnill  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blackrock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Blackrock  </u> </a></p><h3> <strong>  Roadmap for 2016 </strong></h3><p> <br/> Fears of global recession hit markets hard at the start of the year. Yet the anxiety has waned. What&rsquo;s in store for investors in the quarter ahead? Our new global chief investment strategist and leading BlackRock portfolio managers provide a roadmap.</p><p> We see financial markets today dominated by three key themes:</p><h3> 1. Low returns ahead</h3><p> <br/> We are living in a low-return world. Quantitative easing (QE) and negative interest rate policies have inflated financial markets. Many assets have had a great run since the financial crisis. This means future returns are likely to be more muted. We have been borrowing from the future.</p><h3> 2. Divergence is slowing</h3><p> <br/> Monetary policy divergence &mdash; a key driver of the U.S. dollar&rsquo;s gains &mdash; looks to be slowing. The eurozone and Japan are reaching the limits of negative interest rates, and we see future easing coming through QE. The Fed has signaled a slower pace of rate increases. This bodes well for markets.</p><h3> 3. Volatility and opportunity</h3><p> <br/> We expect more volatility as the Federal Reserve (Fed) normalizes policy, the business and credit cycles mature, and risks come to the fore. We see sharp momentum reversals as many investors have piled into similar, correlated trades. This means diversification and security selection are key.</p><p> The chart below addresses the third of the themes above. Valuations rose across the board during the years of QE, both within and between markets, as investors indiscriminately bid up asset prices. Yet dispersion &ndash; the gap between winners and losers within markets &ndash; is set to rise as the Fed lifts raises interest rates and lurking tail risks come to the fore. This argues for an active approach to investing, we believe. It creates opportunities for security selection, but raises the importance of diversification.</p><h3> <strong>  Rising opportunity </strong></h3><p> <br/> Cross-sectional global equity return dispersion, 2008&ndash;2016</p><p> <img alt=\" Rising opportunity - Cross-sectional global equity return distribution (2008-2016)\" src=\"https://assets.blackrock.com/blk-one-assets/cache-1459541165000/images/media-bin/web/global/blackrock-investment-institute/charts/global-equity-return-distribution-opportunity.jpg\"/></p>Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute and MSCI, March 2016. Notes: Cross-sectional return dispersion is the standard deviation of monthly returns of individual securities within the MSCI World Index. QE refers to the U.S. Federal Reserve&rsquo;s quantitative easing programs.<br/><br/> <h3> <strong>  Other key highlights </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Key downside risks are a Chinese yuan devaluation and a U.K. exit from the EU. Upside risks are an emerging market (EM) rebound and a rise in inflation expectations on improving growth prospects.</li><li> Income is king in a low-return environment. We like value equities and dividend growers. We are neutral on credit but favor it over government bonds. And we are warming up to selected EM assets. <br/>  </li><p> For more information visit us <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Let&rsquo;s put an end to NOT looking people in the eye so you don&rsquo;t have to smile or say hello. I think 2016 should be The Year of Connection, and I&rsquo;m not talking digitally here, but face-to-face.</p><p> How often do you avert your eyes from others when in public situations, such as when you&rsquo;re walking on the beach or on the streets, at gatherings or meetings, or just waiting for the elevator? Over the decades we&rsquo;ve lost the art of making purposeful eye contact with strangers, especially these days, when it&rsquo;s all too easy to pull a cell-phone from your pocket and look busy.</p><h3> Where Did Manners Go? <br/>  </h3><p> Did you know that in the late 1800s, people actually concentrated on learning public manners? There were rules of civility when meeting people. Men were expected to make eye contact when passing other men on the street and acknowledge passersby with an inclination of the head or a gesture of the hand, or just touching their hat. They were expected to be a bit more formal when actually meeting a woman, bowing to a lady and lifting the hat from the head.</p><p> Our public manners today would be appalling to 19th Century men and women. People passing each other on the street today do their best NOT to make contact&mdash;eyes straight forward, wearing earphones or busily thumbing mobile phones. Today the mere thought of looking strangers in the eye and smiling at them is out of the ordinary. In fact, it&rsquo;s considered downright peculiar or invasive to some.</p><p> I think this is a dangerous road to travel as a society. Allowing ourselves to become insular and self-focused in the presence of other people isn&rsquo;t just rude, it robs us of our humanity. At its worst it makes us slow to come to the aid of other people. But it also deprives us of opportunities to meet and get to know others in a networking setting where being friendly and polite has its advantages.</p><h3> Get in Some Practice <br/>  </h3><p> Try it sometime. As you go about your daily routines, make an effort to meet the eyes of strangers and smile at them: a person standing in line with you or coming out of the grocery store; while you&rsquo;re in a small group waiting for an elevator; joggers or people walking their dogs. Make a conscious effort to engage in this kind of contact at least once a day with someone. At the very least, it&rsquo;s a mood lifter!</p><p> If you&rsquo;re a wallflower, it can be beneficial to practice greetings in a networking situation such as a Chamber of Commerce card exchange, at an industry event, or simply when attending a cocktail party. Be the first to make that eye contact, say hello, and strike up a conversation with someone new while filling your plate at the salad bar or getting a drink.</p><p> On the reverse side, make it easy for people to do the same to you. Keep your eyes up and look for opportunities to smile at others or return a smile. Say hi, and if you want to talk or engage more, look for subtle, visual and vocal clues that the person may be open to further conversation (or not).</p><h3> Being Busy Shouldn&rsquo;t be an Excuse <br/>  </h3><p> As mobile technology advances and our lives get busier, I think that if we don&rsquo;t make the time and effort to be polite and &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; with the people around us, we&rsquo;re going to lose out on something extremely important.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s make it a priority this year to change that dynamic. It&rsquo;s high time we re-learned those face-to-face skills and stop ignoring the potential human connections that are right in front of our eyes. Chance encounters can turn into acquaintances, friendships, jobs, business partnerships&mdash;even marriages. You never know where that initial smile and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; will take you.</p><p> This orginally appreared on <a href=\"http://tedrubin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Ted Rubin  </u> </a> !</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/nicola-michel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Nicloa Michel  </u> </a></p><p> Prepare for media mel&eacute;e. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison will hand down his first Federal Budget on May 3. Speculation and counter-speculation as to the detail has been rife, but regardless of where the government lands on the big issues from tax reform to concessions in super and funding education, one thing is clear. Time spent planning your communication response now will make the job of responding in the days and weeks after the Budget much easier, and your response much better.</p><p> The good news is that planning ahead doesn&rsquo;t have to be difficult. Here are four steps to get you started.</p><h3> Step 1 - Decide what you will (and won&rsquo;t) be commenting on <br/>  </h3><p> Unless you have limitless resources don&rsquo;t try to boil the ocean. Think about what you want to comment on, where your areas of expertise lie and where you can add most value. This means focusing on your clients and other stakeholders (a.k.a your target audience/s), putting yourself in their shoes, and deciding what information will be most helpful to them.</p><p> Equally, decide areas that, for whatever reason (from domain expertise to political or other sensitivities) you are not prepared to comment on, and pre-prepare a gentle reusable statement to that effect &ndash; ideally one which highlights areas on which are willing to make comment.</p><h3> Step 2 &ndash; Who is going to say what? <br/>  </h3><p> Once you&rsquo;ve decided on your areas for commentary, plan for what you can, including content and spokespeople.</p><p> Content: Consider your position on the outcomes you believe most likely (pro, against, neutral) and pre-prepare some forms of words so you need only slot in the details once they emerge. Writing a brief statement of what the issue/change is a good way of honing in on your key message. Helpful also is a brief situation analysis - what has prompted the change, what the new reality is, and who exactly will be affected and how. Ensure you develop a key message to apply to each audience.</p><p> Spokespeople: Choose a spokesperson or spokespeople for each area (as appropriate). The spokesperson should be media trained and freely available for interview or comment for several days after the budget is brought down. If you are doing real time commentary, your spokespeople should be available on the night.</p><h3> Step 3 &ndash; Choose the right format <br/>  </h3><p> Different formats suit different kinds of content, so be mindful of this in your planning. For example, a change or announcement likely to have complex ramifications might be worth addressing in a number of formats. A media release to highlight the major effect of the change, plus a later white paper offering more detail can work well. Short sharp tweets using the accepted hashtag can make your presence and expertise felt, while longer form e-newsletters along with the traditional print kind also deliver your audience value. And of course, it all goes onto your website!</p><h3> Step 4 &ndash; Choose the right channel/s <br/>  </h3><p> The format you choose will have a serious bearing on the channel you choose &ndash; in fact the channel should reflect not what only you are saying, the format in which you are saying it, but also who you are talking to, and where you are likely to find them. So be mindful of where your audiences like to get their information (media, social media, website, eDMs) and plan accordingly. Remember, your response to the Budget is a prime source of great content that should be amplified as much as possible &ndash; don&rsquo;t let it all end on the night.</p><p> The bottom line? When it comes to your response to the Federal Budget, prior preparation and planning will not only prevent poor performance, it will help you provide an invaluable service to your clients, not to mention position you as an expert in your field.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Ever feel like you just want to give up? <br/>  </h3><p> Ever find yourself frustrated, walking away from situations and people with the same conclusion each time? </p><li> Yup, I knew it- all guys are jerks!</li><li> This is what happens every time I (apply for a job/try something new/trust people).</li><li> Things never work out for me.</li><p> While those generalizations and takeaways keep us safe, they also keep us stuck. So if you&rsquo;re ready to rewrite your ending, it&rsquo;s time you stop blaming the cast, and start getting curious about your role. </p><p> Let me give you an example:</p><p> Years ago, I was in a relationship with the least-punctual man who ever existed. That may sound like a ridiculous claim. (\"Amita, have you met every man in the world and timed each of them?\") But arriving 2 hours late without sending me a text makes him a definite contender for this prestigious award. Each time he&rsquo;d be late, I&rsquo;d tell myself &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always late. Guys are the worst! This is the last time I&rsquo;m dealing with this. He clearly doesn&rsquo;t love me because if he did, he would get his sh!t together and change.&rdquo; </p><p> While his punctuality was indeed an issue, the story I was telling myself was the bigger problem. In my narrative, I made his time management struggles about me.</p><p> The stories we tell ourselves create safety and order out of situations that feel dangerous or chaotic. When in doubt, many of us (myself included) immediately jump to the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not enough&rdquo; explanation.</p><p> Why? Because there&rsquo;s comfort in certainty.</p><p> The familiarity of my story made it easier to be angry at him rather than feeling the more difficult emotion: vulnerability. The good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to keep playing old reruns in your head.</p><h3> You have the power to change your story and choose a better ending. <br/>  </h3><p> The next time you&rsquo;re in a situation when you&rsquo;re feeling triggered &ndash; from a setback to a breakup &ndash; use these steps to overcome feelings of anger, shame, or disappointment:</p><h3> 1. Get Curious. <br/>  </h3><p> You don&rsquo;t need to identify your emotions to know they exist. When you&rsquo;re feeling triggered, (like you&rsquo;re going from 0-60 in 6 seconds flat) it can be challenging to slow down long enough to label your feelings. Instead, start by tapping into your body by asking yourself:</p><li> Where do I feel this sensation?</li><li> What does it feel like? <li>  I feel a knot in my stomach or I feel panic in my chest. </li></li><h3> 2. Engage With It. <br/>  </h3><p> Admittedly, this step sucks. You&rsquo;ll need to tap into your feelings to uncover the narrative. By engaging with your emotions, you&rsquo;ll get a clearer sense of the story that allows these emotions to stagnate and the situation to repeat itself. For example, If you&rsquo;re feeling angry that your hard work wasn&rsquo;t acknowledged, you might be telling yourself, \"This team is ridiculous, my boss is a conceited jerk.\"</p><h3> 3. Collect The Data. <br/>  </h3><p> As much as journaling can feel like a chore, the mind-body connection that occurs is transformative. Quickly, without judgment, write out the answers to the following:</p><li> What story is playing in my head? <li>  I never get any credit, I should just quit. Then they&rsquo;ll see how much they need me. </li></li><li> What are my emotions? <li>  I feel angry and annoyed. </li></li><li> What are my beliefs? <li>  I won&rsquo;t be successful. </li></li><li> What actions do I want to take? <li>  I want to quit. </li></li><p> You have every right to feel the way you do. If your answers are driven by emotion and self-preservation, chances are there may be some missing facts or faulty logic. When we&rsquo;re in a heightened emotional state, it can be hard to remember that feelings aren&rsquo;t facts. By challenging your storyline, you'll begin to uncover what&rsquo;s really going on.</p><h3> 4. Play Detective. <br/>  </h3><p> Grab your make-believe magnifying glass and pick apart your story by asking yourself:</p><li> What parts of what I wrote are fact and whats part are beliefs? <li>  Fact: My name wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in the meeting. But, when I gave my boss my part of the project, he was receptive to my ideas and seemed grateful. </li> <li>  Belief: I never get any credit. I won't be successful. </li></li><li> What additional information would be helpful to know? <li>  What my boss thinks about my potential for growth at this company. </li></li><li> What was my role in this situation and how do I feel about t?  <li>  I feel like I&rsquo;m not good enough. I never ask for his opinion about my performance because I feel scared of what I might hear. I could try asking his opinion and seeing what happens.  </li></li><p> Most of us use anger and resentment to cover up our insecurities. Discovering the underlying stories that keep us stuck teaches us how we confirm our negative beliefs, rather than challenging them.  The truths we uncover are often uncomfortable. But, discomfort is where all the magic and growth happens.</p><h3> The Takeaway <br/>  </h3><p> Knowing how you keep yourself stuck will help you to stop repeating the same old story. It will give you the freedom to take action that&rsquo;s truly aligned with where you want to go and who you want to be.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Should you really fear Robo-Advisors?</h3><p> <br/> Reading financial news, you see many posts warning of robo-advisors, telling you how you really need a human advisor, how you can robo-proof your investment business, or how robo-advisors are merely a fad and will die off when everyone realizes how evil they are.</p><p> All these posts have it backwards.  They are apologists for entrenched firms attempting to protect their turf when individuals need help.</p><h3> Shift from pensions to 401(k) plans hurt individuals</h3><p> <br/> Last century, many large employers provided pensions as a benefit.  These were large portfolios that could hire good advisors and thus performed well.  However, by the end of last century, retirement funds had shifted to 401(k) and similar plans, where individuals managed their own portfolios. </p><p> Institutional portfolios hire great managers so many are able to beat their various market indices.  In contrast, individual investors historically achieve less than half the returns of their related indices. </p><p> Poor performance by individuals managing their own retirement funds is a key factor in the current crisis facing Boomers who are under-funded for retirement.  (Note to Millennials: don&rsquo;t just speak to your parents, do your own planning so this doesn&rsquo;t happen to you!</p><h3> Why do individuals invest poorly?</h3><p> <br/> Individual investors are seen as a contrary indicator: </p><li> If they are buying, then the market is near its peak and it is time to sell; and</li><li> If they are selling, the market has reached its bottom and it is time to buy. <br/>  </li><p> Here is a case in point: </p><p> We saw the regret and pride response in action beginning in March 2000, the largest purchase of mutual funds in the history of the stock market. Fast forward to 2008, just before the &ldquo;Great Recession&rdquo; market downturn, and stock prices were falling, but investors refused to sell at a loss. As the market continued to fall, investors held off until they simply couldn&rsquo;t take it any longer. Many sold their stock near the bottom and missed the following upswing that began March 2009.  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2014/04/24/why-the-average-investors-investment-return-is-so-low/#13e7cd3663a4\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes &ndash; Why average investors returns are so low </a> .  </p><p> To summarize, individual investors perform poorly due to these factors:</p><li> Lack of access to good investment advice; and</li><li> Investment psychology.  For more on the psychological factors to which individuals fall prey, see Seven deadly sins of investing to avoid. <br/>  </li><p> There is a third factor:  High expenses in form of commissions and other fees. </p><p> Robo-advisors address all three factors.</p><li> First, automating advice permits good advisors to offer services to small investors.  Betterment with automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting is a good example.</li><li> Second, automation lowers costs, so fees charged can be reduced.  Combine that with use of ETFs and you have dramatically reduced expenses. </li><li> Last, robo-advisors are immune to greed and fear so their performance will not suffer the way performance of individuals may.  No robo-advisor would wait until the market hit bottom to sell, as in the case of 2008 summarized above. <br/>  </li><h3> Bring on the Robos!</h3><p> <br/> What is my conclusion?  Not only are robo-advisors here to stay, they may be just what individual investors need so they can retire well! </p>",

    "link": "4-common-mistakes-in-customer-service-and-how-to-do-it-better",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JochenWirtz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Jochen Wirtz  </a> </u>  and  <u>  Ron Kaufman </u></p><h3> Traditional Approaches to Often Don&rsquo;t Work! <br/>  </h3><p> Our key message is that traditional approaches to service improvement often don&rsquo;t work. They are fragmented, incremental, and based on faulty assumptions about the true nature of service. Companies try these approaches again and again, and while they may enjoy temporary surges of improvement, people run out of steam and the improvement dies. Instead, many companies would benefit from a more dramatic service revolution that quickly rebuilds their culture around the vision of taking action to create new or greater value for others.</p><h3> Four Common Mistakes and How to Do it Better <br/>  </h3><p> There is a better way to build a culture that quickly and dramatically improves customer service. While many people think changing an organization&rsquo;s culture takes a long time, we have had the opportunity to experiment and observe a wide variety of companies for the past 25 years. We have been part of many innovations and successes. In the process, we observed four common mistakes companies make when implementing service revolutions, and we propose a more effective and proven way to make sure a service revolution sticks and achieves sustainable service improvements.  <br/> They are: <br/> <br/> <strong>  Rule #1: Don&rsquo;t start with customer-facing employees. Instead, involve everyone, with a special focus on internal service providers. </strong></p><p> We found that customer service reps usually understand the importance of satisfied customers; often the real problem lies with other backend function such as logistics, IT, HR, that isn&rsquo;t meeting their frontline colleagues&rsquo; needs. When that&rsquo;s the case, efforts to train customer-facing employees often generates frustration. Therefore, include everyone in service training, and focus special attention on internal service providers. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Rule #2: Don&rsquo;t start by training people on specific service skills, scripts and procedures. Instead, educate them first to a better understanding of what service excellence really means. </strong></p><p> Educate employees more generally about what &ldquo;service excellence&rdquo; means. Companies spend vast sums training employees to follow procedures and flowcharts when interacting with customers. (&ldquo;If the customer says X, respond with Y.&rdquo;) They may then monitor phone calls or use &ldquo;mystery shoppers&rdquo; to ensure adherence to the new rules. But highly scripted employees are often less able to be imaginative or empathetic about a customer&rsquo;s true needs. <br/> <br/> A better approach is to persuade employees to commit to a holistic definition of service: creating value for others, outside and within the organization. Teach them to first appreciate customers&rsquo; concerns and only then to take action. They should continually ask themselves, &ldquo;Who am I going to serve, and what do they need and value most?&rdquo;  This way, employees slip into the shoes of their customers and take actions aligned with what delights their customers. <br/> <br/> <strong>  Rule #3: Don&rsquo;t pilot the change. Instead, go big and go fast to build momentum for the new culture. </strong></p><p> Conventional wisdom calls for limited experiments that, if successful, are later rolled out more broadly.That can work for small tweaks in an organization&rsquo;s culture, but for more-sweeping change, organizations must create momentum fast and set their sights high.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  Rule #4: Don&rsquo;t focus on traditional KPIs during the service revolution (such as satisfaction, NPS, operational measures, and sales). Instead, focus on leading &ldquo;revolution indicators&rdquo; (i.e., ideas generated and ideas implemented) to generate value-adding ideas and new service actions. </strong> <br/> <br/> Instead of worrying about typical customer satisfaction measures such as share of wallet and net promoter scores, organizations that aim for dramatic change should look at the number of new value adding service ideas put into practice. It&rsquo;s not that traditional metrics are unimportant, but because they are &ldquo;lagging indicators&rdquo; that don&rsquo;t show quick improvements and discourage employees, and they can bog down efforts to achieve rapid, dramatic change. Use indicators that respond quickly to actions taken, and that build momentum and excitement in the organization. <br/> <br/> For which kinds of companies would the ideas presented work well and for which will they not work well? </p><p> These four rules would work very well for B2C or B2B companies whose products have become commoditized and who want to differentiate on service. They&rsquo;re great for companies who know they provide sub-optimal service and want to change that, for companies that have undergone mergers and want to create a vibrant new culture, and for companies that have grown rapidly with a primary focus on sales and now need to build a culture of service. <br/> <br/> On the other hand, the four rules will not work well for companies that don&rsquo;t need a revolution&mdash;those that have excellent service coded into their DNA already (such as Disney, Nordstrom, The Ritz-Carlton Hotels, Singapore Airlines, Southwest Airlines, USAA, or Zappos). Also, they won&rsquo;t work for companies whose top leaders aren&rsquo;t 100 percent behind the change.</p><h3> How can the ideas presented in this article be applied other organizations? <br/>  </h3><p> Any organization can follow the four rules outlined in the article, and if they implement them properly, their odds of success are vastly improved.  Today, companies need dramatic change more than ever before. In the past it was possible to gradually try to catch up, but in a global economy a smaller more nimble company can grow very quickly and leap ahead of you. The ideas advanced in this article helps leaders to stage their own successful service revolutions.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Even though our firm only works with online marketing, I&rsquo;d be unrealistic to think that your business will ditch paid advertising and &ldquo;traditional media.&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> Paid advertising and traditional media will have a place in your company&rsquo;s marketing budget for the foreseeable future, but an inbound marketing strategy is something your business needs to develop now in order to stay competitive.</p><p> An integrated marketing plan can combine certain aspects of inbound marketing with outbound marketing ideas in order to pull in more customers. First, let&rsquo;s look at the difference in case you&rsquo;re just hearing about inbound marketing for the first time, and then we&rsquo;ll look at how you can combine the two to amplify your results.</p><h3> The Difference Between Inbound and Outbound Marketing <br/>  </h3><p> For a long time, there was the status quo.  Companies embraced PR, they paid for magazine, radio, TV ads, they went to trade shows.  They paid to play. Then the internet became mainstream and it opened up new ways to promote your business. Now years later, marketing gurus have described it this way:</p><li> Inbound marketing &ndash; Getting the potential client to come to you. Marketing with a magnet instead of beating prospects over the head with a message that interrupts.</li><li> Outbound marketing &ndash; Interrupting the potential client with your message and letting them know about your business. You pay for the placement, and a small percentage take a desired action.</li><p> Traditional techniques would fall under outbound marketing, which would include things like radio/TV ads, print ads, billboards, mailers, etc. You would actually be going outside of an arena you control in order to pull in customers. The problem with this is that you are paying a set amount of money for a certain amount of time for these third parties to promote your business. As soon as the money stops coming in from you, they stop promoting you.</p><p> Inbound marketing techniques deal with bringing people to something you have control over &mdash; your company&rsquo;s website. This is done by putting content on the site that people want to see, something that gives them useful information when they search for it.</p><h3> Bringing Together Inbound and Outbound Marketing <br/>  </h3><p> Both inbound marketing and outbound marketing have their merits. But can you make your paid advertising more effective by combining it with inbound techniques?</p><p> Combining the two may seem difficult to understand at first, but it actually makes a lot of sense. Imagine you are a  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/blog/inbound-marketing-tips-for-medical-practices/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  physician </a>  specializing in back pain and put a lot of information on your website about dealing with back pain. Because you may have several competing practices in your area, you might take out an ad in a local magazine.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve probably placed ads like this &mdash; a physician photo, a practice name and a phone number.  The problem with this ad is that people don&rsquo;t just see ads an pick up the phone anymore. Information is freely available on the internet, and so they do some research when they are not at work and when your office is closed.  They aren&rsquo;t looking for a diagnosis, just information. And what we know about these people is that they trust practices that put helpful information online.</p><p> Instead, let&rsquo;s say you placed that magazine ad directing them to your website to read an article called &ldquo;How to Prevent Back Pain While Sitting At Your Desk.&rdquo; The article might talk about when it&rsquo;s time to see a doctor and include a link to an appointment request form.  </p><p> Instead of just advertising your practice, you&rsquo;ve helped them solve a problem.</p><h3> Why Inbound Marketing is a Good Fit for Your Business <br/>  </h3><p> At least 81% of people look online before they make a major purchase. A lot of what they are searching for has to do with information on a particular product or service. Even in the manufacturing industry, the internet plays an important role in determining where a client decides to take their business. If someone looking for information finds it on your website, they are going to be more likely to get in touch.</p><h3> What Are Some Practical Ways to Combine Inbound and Outbound Marketing? <br/>  </h3><p> A few practical examples of how inbound and outbound marketing can work together include:</p><li> Using email marketing lists that you&rsquo;ve built organically and your company social media profiles to send out trade show booth invitations and RSVPs ahead of an upcoming trade show.</li><li> Having sales reps call people that simply download brochures, whitepapers and guides from your website.</li><li> Monitoring social media profiles of companies you meet at trade shows to collect intelligence and provide clues for when you should follow up by phone, like around an acquisition or round of funding.</li><li> Sending out email &ldquo;thank yous&rdquo; by email to trade show booth attendees and offer them your latest whitepaper or guide.</li><li> Referencing a lead generation offer on your website like a whitepaper during a speaking engagement.</li><li> Linking to a lead generation offer for download on your website from a trade publication advertisement rather than just showing information about your company in the ad.</li><li> Using website analytics to make a list of companies that visited your website, then compiling a prospect call list.</li><p> Increasing your inbound marketing reach also has the effect of stretching your advertising dollar. Outbound marketing methods might be effective as long as you&rsquo;re paying top dollar for them.  Combine your paid advertising with inbound marketing and you&rsquo;ll create marketing that people can actually use.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The short answer is yes. Change the culture. <br/>  </h3><p> &ldquo;Cyber defense of DoD systems is [my] highest cyber priority; if DoD systems are not dependable in the face of cyber warfare, all other DoD missions are at risk.&rdquo; &ndash; Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, April 18, 2015</p>Cyber security is a leadership issue.  Period. Yet, too many boards and CEOs are leaving it in the hands of CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and the like. And even though boards are scrambling to fill open positions with cyber security experts, a 2015 PWC report indicates boards still see cyber security not as CEO matter but as an information technology issue. They&rsquo;re wrong.<br/>    <p> In late 2015 I shared a post titled &ldquo;7 Actions CEO Can Take Right Now to Protect Their Data and Networks.&rdquo; The 7 actions are:</p><p> 1.     Create a climate of tight cyber security</p><p> 2.     Ban USB thumb drives</p><p> 3.     Get serious about passwords</p><p> 4.     Re-certify every E-mail account</p><p> 5.     Implement mandatory information assurance training</p><p> 6.     Track and monitor software patch implementation</p><p> 7.     Limit access to most sensitive data</p><p> Good post, but not long enough to go into each of the actions in depth.  This article begins a series to cover each of the 7 actions more fully.   </p><h3> CYBER SECURITY COMPANIES CAN'T DO IT ALL <br/>  </h3><p> Like any cultural shift within an organization it&rsquo;s going to take time, persistence, hard work and leadership commitment and involvement.</p><p> Steve Denning, in Forbes, tells us this concerning culture change, &ldquo;In general, the most fruitful success strategy is to begin with leadership tools, including a vision or story of the future, cement the change in place with management tools, such as role definitions, measurement and control systems, and use the pure power tools of coercion and punishments as a last resort, when all else fails.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s not enough to subscribe to a service or simply tell the CIO to implement an information security plan.  It&rsquo;s also not a one person or one department function.  It requires each member of the organization to take a proactive approach and to remain vigilant. </p><p> This only happens if the CEO is engaged, enthused and is a leading advocate of cyber security.  </p><h3> DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MAY BE DOING IT RIGHT <br/>  </h3><p> Earlier this week Secretary of Defense Ash Carter publically released their cyber defense plan. More importantly, Secretary Carter will conduct monthly strategic-level cyber security reviews.  Additionally, each level of management below him will dig into deeper detail with smaller sized units reporting their cyber readiness in the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).</p><p> Although DRRS cyber security reporting is new, commander involvement in cyber threats is not. </p><p> I remember very distinctly my three-star boss in 2013 reminding us junior one-star commanders cyber security was commander business and that he would hold us and only us accountable should something go wrong. Trust me, we got the message loud and clear.</p><p> I understand changing cyber security culture doesn&rsquo;t sound fun or exciting. There are normally &ldquo;far more pressing&rdquo; issues at hand like restructures, reorganizations, buyouts, increasing shareholder value and so on. What happens if the company&rsquo;s data is breached or held hostage to ransom ware?  Won&rsquo;t this affect everything else? </p><p> The DoD is the world&rsquo;s largest employer, has a $600B budget and its mission is national defense. Yet, if Secretary Carter can dedicate his time and attention to cyber defense then can&rsquo;t CEOs and Boards do the same?</p><h3> BOARDS ARE FINALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CYBER CRIME <br/>  </h3><p> Boards are hiring more individuals with cyber experience and this is a good start but it&rsquo;s hardly a panacea.  Because cyber threats and cyber attacks affect shareholder value and the long-term viability of the company, boards are going to have to develop a deeper understanding of all the issues surrounding cyber security. </p><p> They&rsquo;ve got to go beyond asking the CISO about firewalls, anti-virus protection or what cyber security subscription service the company uses. Furthermore, throwing money at cyber security won&rsquo;t do the trick either if the accompanying policies, procedures, climate and culture aren&rsquo;t in place as well.</p><p> Clint Boulton, a Senior Writer for CIO agrees, &ldquo;(Boards) have to embrace it, get a deep understanding and connection to it, and then drive the change at their companies so that they can make the proper investments. Because it&rsquo;s a significant investment, and a significant change to your culture and budgets that is really difficult to drive from the bottom up. It has to come from top down. That&rsquo;s a multi-year process and we&rsquo;re nowhere near the finish line.&rdquo;</p><h3> WRAPPING IT ALL UP <br/>  </h3><p> It is going to take time and we are nowhere near the finish line.  Ultimately Boards and CEOs are going to drive the changes, but insurance companies and shareholders are going to demand those changes.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, CIOs and CISOs are worth their weight in gold, but until cyber security is seen and accepted as a leadership issue, change will come at a much slower pace, if at all.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There is a stereotype of the rainmaking senior consultant as a slick-talking, extrovert. He or she is instantly able to command the room by the sheer force of their presence.</p><p> They easily talk the CEO into seeing things their way and close million dollar deals on a handshake. They build and maintain a voluminous network over years of conversations, industry parties and meetings that make introverts cringe.</p><p> Stereotypes often exist for a reason&mdash;in this case, extroverted rainmakers are not infrequently at the top of the heap in advisory firms.</p><p> But does that mean a quieter&mdash;more introverted&mdash;personality can&rsquo;t make it in consulting?</p><h3> And can they build their own independent business without extraverts to sell for them?</h3><p> <br/> No and yes. With the right conditions, even a classic introvert can create a rocking business for themselves.</p><p> (Full disclosure: I test as an extrovert, but I live a chunk of most days as a classic introvert&mdash;solo work deep in my head.)</p><p> I&rsquo;ve shared introvert stories before&mdash; <u>  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/brand-you-dominatrix-or-librarian/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   like Lester  </a> </u>  &ndash;and talked about situational extroverts  <u>  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/introverts-selling-quietly/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/think-speak-repeat-why-introverts-rule/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p><p> I got to thinking about this again after a conversation with the owner of a financial advisory firm. He&rsquo;d had mixed results hiring introverts&mdash;the reluctant marketers amongst them sometimes had real challenges building their own, sustainable practices over time.</p><p> When I asked him why he didn&rsquo;t hire the occasional extrovert, he told me about interviewing a classic, bubbly (with brains and impressive CV) personality. When he asked her if she was a good listener&mdash;a non-negotiable requirement in his client-focused practice&mdash;she said &ldquo;not really&rdquo; and proceeded to talk non-stop for the rest of the session.</p><p> His conclusion after scores of interviews and a dozen hires was that he&rsquo;d rather invest in a quieter advisor who modeled the firm&rsquo;s client approach&mdash;even if it meant he had to work diligently to help them grow their client base.</p><h3> Think about that for a moment.</h3><p> <br/> That consulting and advisory are actually about listening and deep knowledge, not just presenting.</p><p> That how you bond with a client makes it easier to serve them.</p><p> My practice includes more than a few introverts needing some branding and marketing chutzpah. And a goodly sample of the effervescent extroverts. Neither group has THE claim to the easiest road in consulting.</p><p> But the introvert who knows how to manage their energy&mdash;and use the tools at their disposal to make it work&mdash;can have brilliant and quite lucrative consulting careers.</p><p> Here are a few ways to turn a tendency to be quiet into a consulting strength:</p><h3> Become THE brain surgeon. </h3><p> <br/> Think of an aspect of your expertise where you operate as THE brain surgeon&mdash;where you build up your reputation so that others come to you. One of my clients did exactly that with deep research in a narrow field that was both academically and commercially &ldquo;hot&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s the guy that gets called for a bet-the-business problem. He doesn&rsquo;t spend time building more than a handful of relationships, but those and his media footprint (built organically over time) drive the right people to his door.</p><p> Choose a specialty and an approach that allow you to focus deeply on your client. Financial advisory is one where you&mdash;in the right environment&mdash;can build a small, tight and still lucrative practice serving people who need you. But so is almost any solo specialty if you decide to do deep work for a small circle. What can you focus on that will free you to do your very best work?</p><p> Use social media (selectively). Don&rsquo;t equate this with your Facebook-crazed pals who post every thought in their head. I challenge you to think seriously about how you can use the right social media to bring your ideal audience closer. Unlike live and in-person sessions, you can schedule posts and sharing and only engage in those windows where you&rsquo;re ready. LinkedIn and Twitter especially abound with audiences who will appreciate your insight.</p><p> Try being the (occasional) situational extrovert. Let me be clear&mdash;I&rsquo;m not suggesting you be someone you&rsquo;re not. I&rsquo;m saying&mdash;  <u>  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/brand-you-dominatrix-or-librarian/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   like Lester  </a> </u>  &mdash; that you rise occasionally to take advantage of a big-platform opportunity. Some of the best speakers I know live as introverts in daily life&mdash;but they take the stage to share their passions. And because their subject matter is so dear to them, they pass on their enthusiasm in a powerful way.</p><p> Introverts may be the traditional underdogs of financial advisory, but they absolutely rule when they marry their best working style with their interests and talents.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> As an advisor, do you measure up?</h3><p> <br/> When women choose a financial advisor, they look for more than a qualified and properly registered advisor who works for a well-respected firm; they look for someone they feel comfortable with and someone they can relate to and trust.</p><p> So what does that mean to financial advisors who are used to being judged on their performance? How can you change your behaviors and approach to be the kind of advisor women want? First and foremost you have to understand what is really important to women (in addition to performance) and what is likely going through their heads when they meet you. <br/> <br/> Remember, you only have one chance at making a good first impression so it&rsquo;s worth your while to see how you&rsquo;d measure up.</p><h3> <strong>  What women look for in an advisor: </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> Someone they can relate to on a personal level.</h3><p> Do we have any interests in common, something beyond finance?</p><h3> A person who will understand them and their unique situation.</h3><p> Can this advisor appreciate losing a partner or understand my fear of being destitute? Does he know what it&rsquo;s like being a busy executive and/or parent?</p><h3> A mutually trusting relationship.</h3><p> Does he only seem interested in my money or is he willing to earn my trust by giving me information that&rsquo;s important to me but where he makes no money?</p><h3> Someone who really listens and is more interested in her than in &ldquo;selling&rdquo; something.</h3><p> Does he spend more time trying to impress me with his credentials and investing strategies than he does listening to me?</p><h3> A person who respects her and her time.</h3><p> Is he trying to rush me? Does he make me feel like I don&rsquo;t have enough money to waste his time and is he willing to meet me on my schedule?</p><h3> An advisor who can put investing in terms that resonate with her.</h3><p> When he talks about portfolios, does he talk jargon, asset allocation and security selection or does he talk about investing in terms of my life goals?</p><h3> Someone who is clear and transparent about how he gets paid.</h3><p> Does he seem comfortable talking about how he makes money from my account? Or does he skip the details and hope I don&rsquo;t ask any questions?</p><h3> <strong>  Take away </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not just about performance.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Do you ever wonder why you make terrible decisions or feel awful about your choices? If so, I hope these lessons from my life help you.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve mentioned lately I&rsquo;ve felt mentally bankrupt. That was true, but I&rsquo;m back on track now. I discovered why I became exhausted. It was much more difficult to identify the culprit than I anticipated.</p><p> This past Saturday, I took some time to think and plan. Maybe re-plan is the more appropriate word.</p><p> I surveyed my list of goals and projects. I took a deeper look at my calendar of events and wondered how these lists, activities, and appointments magically appeared.</p><p> Obviously, I decided, they were important to me at some point. Many still are. When I examined them collectively, however, I realized this grouping of activities and appointments wouldn&rsquo;t make me happy.</p><p> My life and calendar needed a triage. Sometimes you just need to strip the building down to the studs and start over. That&rsquo;s what I did and I wanted to make sure this situation doesn&rsquo;t occur again.</p><p> So, I considered how my life&mdash;the sum of all those itty-bitty decisions&mdash;got this way. When I made some notes during this process, I discovered four reasons why you and I sometimes make terrible decisions.</p><p> No, it&rsquo;s not someone else&rsquo;s fault&hellip;</p><p> First, let&rsquo;s make sure we understand who&rsquo;s not at fault&mdash;someone else! You make your own decisions or should make your own decisions.</p><p> No one gave you bad advice. No one forced you to do something. In all cases, you chose. But, for those decisions you consider bad in hindsight, why did you choose poorly?</p><p> Uh, was that in the fine print?</p><h3> <strong>  You didn&rsquo;t gather enough information. </strong></h3><p> <br/> In  <u>  <a href=\"http://milewalk.com/books/the-hiring-prophecies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The Hiring Prophecies: Psychology behind Recruiting Successful Employees  </a> </u> , I spent more than a few thousand words explaining job candidates&rsquo; decision-making processes. One serious mechanical error they (and employers) make results from the  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/chip-dan-heath-how-make-better-choices-life-work\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   spotlight effect  </a> </u> . There are many factors to this phenomenon, but this particular error transpires when someone decides based solely on the limited information available (the spot lit information). Everything outside the light is ignored as irrelevant. How many times have you thought to yourself I wouldn&rsquo;t have done that if I knew &lsquo;that&rsquo; then? Make sure to keep expanding your intake of information.</p><h3> <strong>  You didn&rsquo;t consider the trade-offs. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Every time you say yes or no in any decision, you&rsquo;re actually saying yes and no to many additional decisions. For example, I&rsquo;m sitting here writing this post on a Saturday. I said yes to write this blog and simultaneously said no to spend time with my wife and fur babies. When I say yes to one client that means every other client gets a little less of me. You get the idea. Make sure you examine the full picture before you decide.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-12-at-9.37.04-AM.png\" width=\"509\"/></p><h3> <strong>  You didn&rsquo;t consider the full impact. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Every decision has consequences. Some of the fallout is fabulous and some might be disastrous. Did you look far enough into the future? Did you look far enough to your right and left? Play out the scenario. If I choose this, what will likely happen down the road? What could happen? What&rsquo;s the best scenario? What&rsquo;s the worst scenario? Who could this help or hurt?</p><h3> <strong>  You weren&rsquo;t clear on your motives. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Every decision you make, I&rsquo;d like to think, is in some way for your benefit. I don&rsquo;t mean this selfishly. In fact, I consider doing something nice for someone else also for your benefit. It&rsquo;s good to give! But, how many decisions have you made because you thought you had to or didn&rsquo;t want to upset the apple cart? Once you have clarity regarding why you want to do something, you&rsquo;ll make sure to align your decisions to that reasoning.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Costly Strategic Errors and Mistakes</h3><p> <br/> Did you know that misinterpretation of signals of change and disruption is the number one error generating condition for top managers? The most critical condition causing failures is our unfamiliarity with a situation that is potentially important, but novel or only infrequently occurring. Another primer for errors is a really low signal to noise ratio. Such a ratio makes it very difficult to pinpoint real threats and opportunities within the barrage of information that hits us each and every day.  I heard somewhere that a manager sees more variety in information before lunch, than a medieval man in his entire lifetime. So here&rsquo;s some help: a list of sources where the signal to noise ratio is high, and some pointers for interpretation.</p><h3> Where to Look for Signals of Disruption <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Within the firm, </strong> new brooms and brains provide managers with real-time information about new behaviors, needs and wants from the outside world. Most importantly, the way that co-workers react to that information is telling about the real agility of your firm.</li><li> <strong>  The fountain of youth </strong> can also be tapped by involving younger family members, high potentials, start-ups and trend watchers investigating youth culture. In this area, even though you firm may not cater to this audience, you will find paradigm shifts. Such as the actual place and manners that technology is used and to what end (everywhere, all devices and channels, for rapid satisfaction of needs as power, affiliation, autonomy, and wealth). And it will tell you how to communicate your messages: it is the tone that makes the music and we&rsquo;ll have to whistle the future&rsquo;s tunes.</li><li> <strong>  The regular suspects as trade shows </strong> and magazines, conferences, and best practices are not that informative when we&rsquo;re searching for future disruption. However, here&rsquo;s the best place to informally discuss your hunches and categorize signals into urgency levels.</li><li> <strong>  Perhaps one of the most concrete sources </strong> are similar firms in other regions, trends and prototypes from other industries, and new research from universities. It&rsquo;s not the literal developments that are important, but the process that developments follow. For instance, in manufacturing lot&rsquo;s of successful firms emerged. Their particular product ranged from yachts to semi conductors. That variety of products is not relevant. But their process: thinking in affordable, easy to produce and innovate components may very well the eye opener that you need to bring your firm into the future. <br/>  </li><h3> The Rise of Disruption Needs a Response</h3><p> <br/> The likelihood that markets will be disturbed rises partly due to the mounting numbers of innovations that will hit the markets. Paired with the snowballing rate of connectivity, disruption in earlier contained regions, markets, or industries will spread wider than ever. At the micro level of each firm, a good deal of money and security is at stake when markets collapse. Firms need to learn to become agile and adaptable. Earlier detection of possible disturbance, when strong signals are still weak, gains reaction time and leaves firms with a choice between profiting from or protecting against change!</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  We&rsquo;ve worked with many successful partners who attribute some of the strength in their partnership to time spent in social activities as they got to know each other: </strong> golfing, biking, weekend travel with spouses.  Yet we continue to see partners seeking mediation who had terrific social relationships but have profound problems in their business partnership. </p><p> New research by Noam Wasserman at Harvard Business School, as well as internal research done at Google, shows that having strong social bonds is not a predictor of how well work teams perform.  In research focused specifically on entrepreneurial partnerships, those formed based on social ties scored lowest in partnership stability.</p><p> It&rsquo;s true that spending time in a social situation with those you do not know well can help you see red flags about how they might behave in work situations, but <strong>  nothing replaces actually working together for predicting strong long-term partnerships. </strong>  In fact, the strong social compatibility you have with friends and family may be counterproductive when it comes to forming a partnership. The Harvard team found that the hierarchy of relationships that form the most stable partnerships is:</p><li> Work relationships</li><li> Strangers/acquaintances</li><li> Families/ friends <br/>  </li><h3> Of course, this is the opposite of the order that many people seek their business partners.</h3><p> <br/> It is natural to look first to family and friends, people you are already comfortable with and have some level of trust.  Unfortunately this often means there are preconceived notions about how work relationships will play out that are not tested, or even very deeply discussed, before launching the business.</p><p> This may also be why partnership among strangers and acquaintances have greater stability. Online services like CoFoundersLab and Founders2be make it easier to find strangers who fit the business needs of your company.  These types of pairings can lead to more due diligence in testing the partnership fit since there are fewer assumptions and no pre-existing relationship to worry about damaging by having open and thorough conversations about expectations.</p><p> If you want to do something fun outside of the office to test or strengthen your partnership the most beneficial bonding is trying something that is new for everyone. There is neuroscience research showing that these types of activities activate different parts of your brain and help you look at even very familiar things (and people) in new ways.</p><p> While it is never a bad idea to spend quality time with a partner or prospective partner outside of the office, enjoying golf, biking, skiing or any fun experience together, it&rsquo;s important to know that even if you get along brilliantly while doing so, it may not translate to success in your partnership. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Want to learn how a sales guy is using LinkedIn and Twitter to get C-Level Appointments? <br/>  </h3><p> People often say to me &ldquo;Social Media is for teenagers, give me an example of where people are using Social Media to create, real, tangible, business.&rdquo; Here is that example.</p><p> Paul  <u>  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snapdragon_paul\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   @snapdragon_paul  </a> </u>  contacted me on Twitter, he lives close to me, so we agreed to have a coffee. I was interested in his story on how he had saved &pound;70,000 on recruitment fees by using Cloud and Social Media. We got talking, and Paul talked through his sales career (story was very similar to mine) and then talked about how he was using Social in his current sales role.</p><p> What hooked me, was when he told me he had made 10 C-Level appointments in a week! (Last week he did 12, but on average he reckons he can do 10). This blog will now share with you his secret.</p><h3> Sales &mdash; Starting at the Bottom! <br/>  </h3><p> When Paul and I got our &ldquo;big breaks&rdquo; in sales we started from the bottom. Both of us had been given telephone directories and told to &ldquo;call that&rdquo;. There was no LinkedIn, we didn&rsquo;t know what a Value Proposition was, and we knew nothing about how to conduct ourselves on the telephone.</p><p> Maybe it&rsquo;s down to personality, but actually we were both pretty good at it. My view was, well I&rsquo;m probably never going to meet these people, so if I make a fool of myself, who cares?</p><h3> Cold Calling &mdash; Things have Changed <br/>  </h3><p> Paul then expanded on how over the past 20 years making cold calls had got more difficult. More voice mail, more gatekeepers employed to keep us sales people away from &ldquo;Decision Makers&rdquo;.  There are many social selling articles written that you don&rsquo;t need to make cold calls anymore, I&rsquo;m not so sure about it, but it has got harder and harder.</p><h3> How Do you Book C-Level Meetings using Social Media? <br/>  </h3><p> Paul started doing all the things I write about here from a social selling point of view. He set himself up with a buyer centric profile on LinkedIn and Twitter and started curating and posting articles that he thought would be interesting to his audience. The day before we met, he had got a C-Level meeting purely from an Infographic on LinkedIn. He showed me the dialogue on LinkedIn. As simple as that, decent content on LinkedIn and bam... a Meeting. Anyway back to how he gets 10 appointments a week.</p><p> As all good sales professionals do, he researches his target accounts (no different than we have done for the past 30 years) but this time he does this in the social world of LinkedIn. (Paul and I both recommend you pay the subscription and get access to the Sales Navigator.) He researches the organisation, business issues, news items and executives and then looks for the people from the target account on Twitter. Paul, follows all his target accounts and the C-Level people he has researched on Twitter.</p><p> His usual, approach to a C-Level contact is &ldquo;Noticed you were talking about XYZ have you considered this?&rdquo; This, being some content that the contact will be interested in to drive the conversation forward.</p><p> He got a meeting with a C-Level Executive in the UK&rsquo;s Post Office. There's a roll out of technology that this executive has responsibility for. Paul took a photo of this particular technology in his local Post Office and Tweeted to this individual &ldquo;Great to see this technology being rolled out&rdquo;, the Executive replied and they got into a dialogue. Paul telling the Executive he had a presentation that might be of interest. The executive then followed Paul back so they could have a direct message (DM) conversation. Paul shared the presentation.</p><h3> Using Twitter Rooms &mdash; &ldquo;Tag&rdquo; Selling <br/>  </h3><p> With some good research and a degree of luck, Paul usually gets a follow back and then enters into a (DM) direct message conversation.</p><p> As with many sales organisations, Paul is a sales &ldquo;generalist&rdquo; so once he is in a DM conversation he brings in a colleague with specialist domain experience. He does this using Twitter rooms. He always asks permission to bring in the colleague. At the point the specialist is engaged, he closes for next action, which in his case is a meeting / appointment. He calls this tactic &ldquo;shared Twitter Rooms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tag Selling&rdquo;.</p><p> Paul says he gets a far better response in Twitter room and says he never asks for the sale directly, by then there should be trust built between the two parties.</p><h3> Results so far &mdash; 10 C-Level Meetings per week <br/>  </h3><p> Now I agree tat maybe your product or service isn&rsquo;t the same as Paul&rsquo;s but you have to admit that using Social this way is pretty impressive, even if you got one c-level meeting you would be closer to doing your number, yes?</p><h3> There&rsquo;s One More Thing <br/>  </h3><p> He described this as &ldquo;rolling out dough.&rdquo; When you find a contact on Twitter, it will also suggest another three people that of a similar quality. This he says, provides a list of good quality suspects for you to follow up.</p>",

    "link": "5-tips-to-locate-an-intern-who-will-really-contribute-to-your-team",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/author/krledbettergmail-com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kelly Ledbetter  </u> </a> Interns are risky.A great intern can increase your efficiency and revenue, but a bad intern can be a serious hindrance to your company&rsquo;s productivity.To avoid addition by subtraction at the end of an internship, follow these five tips to locate an intern who will really contribute to your team &mdash; and who you would consider bringing on full-time once the internship is up.</p><h3> 1) Offer meaningful work</h3>This might be a no-brainer, but if you bore your intern, you will get apathetic work.Perhaps unsurprisingly, interns are seeking challenging assignments. According to Forbes, meaningful work ranks in the top five choices interns make about companies, along with an opportunity for full-time employment and job training.That means you should offer interns responsibility beyond mere entry-level duties.Going to the trouble to give interns tasks that you might consider suitable only for a full-time employee shows the intern that you are willing to make the internship mutually beneficial.<h3> 2) Search for someone specific</h3>You don&rsquo;t want just any college student or recent graduate on your sales floor&mdash;let&rsquo;s say you want someone who has international travel experience, too.Clearly defining both the job description and your expectations will help you weed out unqualified applicants and attract those who approach both your work and their work thoughtfully.In an interview, what would you rather say?<li> So what&rsquo;s your major?</li><li> Tell me about how you want to incorporate your leadership training from your study abroad program into helping us meet our marketing goals.</li>(Hint: It&rsquo;s 2.)<h3> 3) Advertise in the right places</h3>Diversifying the locations where you advertise for your internship is likely to produce the best results.<li> <u>  <a href=\"https://www.internships.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Internships.com  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.monstercollege.in/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Monster College  </a> </u> , or  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.looksharp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Internmatch  </a> </u> . These and other similar sites connect students and employers.</li><li> Social media. Share a link to the detailed job description on your website. Then share the link again and again.</li><li> Blog. Better yet, blog about why your company&rsquo;s internship is competitive. Not enough time to blog?</li><li> Local universities. Is there a job board in the computer lab? Put up a flier.</li><li> Word of mouth. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of talking to your clients, employees, and even former professors about seeking an intern.</li>(Note: While students seek internships all year, high traffic times for searchers are March for summer internships, August for fall, and November for spring.)<h3> 4) Provide competitive rates &amp; flexibility</h3>PAY:The U.S. Department of Labor says you have to pay your intern minimum wage if you want them to &ldquo;provide value&rdquo; to your business. Otherwise, they won&rsquo;t be able to contribute to your company in any significant way.But offering minimum wage isn&rsquo;t necessarily competitive. According to Looksharp, if you want to attract the top 5% of interns, you should offer pay between $12 and $15 per hour. If you&rsquo;re looking for a graduate student, it could be even more than that.HOURS:It&rsquo;s typical to offer 15 to 20 hours per week, and since most interns are students, you&rsquo;ll need to keep their class schedule in mind.Flexibility is key. Nights, evenings, weekends, Tuesdays and Thursdays after 2:30, or 9 to 5 on Monday and Friday only.<h3> 5) Help them set &amp; meet individual goals</h3>Interns aren&rsquo;t like other employees. Because they know they are temporary (most internships are 8 to 12 weeks), they are actively seeking personal gain from the experience&mdash;not just a paycheck.Remember that discussion you had in the interview, the one where you asked the intern how their leadership experience would help you out? Encourage your intern to set at least one personal short-term and long-term goal.(Example: Learn to navigate QuickBooks and sign on two new clients.)Fulfilling this could be as simple as scheduling two evaluations, one within a week of hiring and one within a week of the program&rsquo;s conclusion.<h3> THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME</h3>You offer an internship with real responsibility. You describe it in detail, and you advertise locally, widely, and in a timely manner.You offer a rate above minimum wage and flexible scheduling. You recognize that interns have personal goals and want to work together to develop their attractiveness to other businesses.Then you realize that the &ldquo;other business&rdquo; is you. You&rsquo;ve just trained someone who shares your company&rsquo;s vision and would make a great fit on your team&mdash;all year long.Interns want to find full-time jobs, and you want to find interns with the potential to become full-time employees. Making a careful hiring decision can optimize the likelihood that their goals and your goals will mesh. (And if not, you&rsquo;ve just made a fan who will recommend your company to other job-seekers.)Taking the time and effort to invest in seeking a high quality intern isn&rsquo;t just about the intern. It&rsquo;s about finding a valuable employee that can help grow your business.",

Between his recommendation and the historical value showing nothing but upward mobility, why not? Well, it hit. A solid 34% gain in just about a month. Amazing, right? I was so excited, I could barely wait to see what it would do next. And that&rsquo;s the turning point. A couple of dips later, I still had a significant gain, but I was going to ride it all the way back up. It had to bounce back, right? That&rsquo;s optimism bias. So to remove myself from further discouragement, I opted to not check it daily, even weekly. And in about the same amount of time of its rise to greatness, it dipped to pennies on the dollar below my initial buy-in. What happened? I got greedy? I didn&rsquo;t set limits (gain or loss)? I got caught in the Herd-following bias. I was following the lead of the others instead of the hard facts, or following a set plan.</p><p> Well, I finally got around to telling my Financial Advisor. Even though she&rsquo;s entrusted with my long-term savings plans, I&rsquo;d not considered sharing my &ldquo;fun experiment.&rdquo; She took one look at the company&rsquo;s performance and simply said &ldquo;they&rsquo;re awful, sell it while you still have something. And next time, check with me first&rdquo;. Good advice, but not what I wanted to hear. So, I kept it anyway, even in light of overwhelming odds. That&rsquo;s Overconfidence Bias.</p><p> It&rsquo;s been almost six years of hanging onto to this one-time trading nightmare. At least, we weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;missing&rdquo; the money, just sad to have seemingly blown the wad. On a positive note, I&rsquo;m on the cusp of another big potential return. A rental house we bought at the bottom of the market and now, with a little elbow grease, is primed for resale. Bought, mind you, with our Financial Advisor&rsquo;s full support. It&rsquo;s our backup plan if we both lose our jobs and need to get out of our big, nice house quick. We could downsize finances in a hurry. Anyway, the silver lining, since I&rsquo;ve held onto the dog of a stock, is to sell it when we sell the house and take the stock loss to offset the house profit. Not brain surgery, but in sync with our advisor&rsquo;s input.</p><p> A nice story about Behavioral Bias and advisor communication, but let&rsquo;s get back to the Financial Personality of a person who might seem to haphazardly buy high and sell low, when they meant to do otherwise, and how this affects long-term financial planning efforts.</p><p> Our Financial Personality covers both innate and learned behaviors in regards to our financial decisions. It also includes our behavioral biases, communication style, and Market Mood.</p><p> So knowing one&rsquo;s Financial Personality is the key to developing financial goals and then the plan to achieve them. This transparency in truly understanding ourselves helps us navigate volatile market events and stay on point for the greater good. Your Financial Advisor has assessment tools that can quantify your personality traits. There&rsquo;s a self-guided version posted  <u>  <a href=\"http://financialdna.com/investor/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here (personal assessment)  </a> </u>  to try for yourself.</p><p> <a href=\"http://blog.dnabehavior.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"3\" src=\"http://blog.dnabehavior.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Another integral part in working with your Financial Advisor, or any business colleague, friend neighbor or significant other, is communication.</p><p> Recall that I included my advisor on the house purchase, but I only spoke with friends on the stock ordeal? Well, we all have our own  <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2016/02/19/4-financial-personalities-and-how-to-work-with-the?page_all=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  communication style </a> . And we tend to run in circles where our own style is fairly prevalent &mdash; learned from families and developed amongst friends. But in the business world, good communication is key to being understood, and understanding others. And we won&rsquo;t always get to choose to (or from) whom we engage. So we have to learn to adapt (or be left behind). Wouldn&rsquo;t you want a way to identify how you come across to others or how best for others to engage you? Well, there are assessment tools for this too. Again,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.communicationdna.com/mystyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here (communication style)  </a> </u>  is an assessment you can try, and even share with others.</p><p> It&rsquo;s no coincidence that I included the interactions with my Financial Advisor as part of my financial thrill of victory and agony of defeat. She was and continues to be in my corner for staying on course and avoid making bad decisions when the terrain suddenly changes. And some mistakes have wholly been on my own. Now, this may not be the case for everyone, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re kicking off this discussion &mdash; to find the peaks and valleys of our financial journeys and help one another along the way. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> There are many reasons why 78% of business leaders consider employee engagement and retention top concerns. <br/>  </h3><p> Here&rsquo;s one of them: It costs a lot of money to hire new employees. </p><p> According to researchers from the UC Berkeley Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, businesses can spend up to $7,000 to hire a skilled employee. </p><p> Does that number seem a little high to you? Let&rsquo;s break it down:</p><h3> 1. Salary and benefits for recruiters <br/>  </h3><p> Yes, you&rsquo;ll ultimately have to stomach the salary and benefits expenses that pertain to your new hire. But before you get to that point, you&rsquo;ll have to pay your recruiters to source candidates.</p><h3> 2. Signing bonuses <br/>  </h3><p> Not every organization offers signing bonuses. But to make their offers that much more attractive than their competitors&rsquo; offers, many do.</p><h3> 3. Job listing fees <br/>  </h3><p> When you use a site like Craigslist or LinkedIn to advertise new openings at your organization, you have to pay a fee. Generally speaking, these fees are determined based on geographic location. According to a  <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/how-much-it-costs-to-post-a-job-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Glassdoor </a>  blog post, LinkedIn charges up to $495 for a 30-day job posting, while you might only have to pay $25 to get a job up on Craigslist.</p><h3> 4. Third-party recruiter fees <br/>  </h3><p> Hiring a candidate who&rsquo;s been passed to you via a third-party recruiting firm might save your organization a whole lot of time. But it probably won&rsquo;t reduce your costs. According to  <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-do-recruiters-get-paid-and-how-much\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Quora </a> , recruiters can charge anywhere from 20% to 33% of a new hire&rsquo;s salary.</p><h3> 5. Employee referral bonuses <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;ve got an opening, why not ask your staff whether they know candidates who would be the perfect fit? It&rsquo;s like networking with your employees. To encourage employees to participate in such a program, many organizations offer referral bonuses (e.g., $2,000 if the new hire lasts more than 90 days) &mdash; which factor into onboarding expenses.</p><h3> 6. Travel expenses <br/>  </h3><p> Companies often offer to buy prospective candidates plane tickets, so they can fly across the country for an interview. They&rsquo;ll put them up in hotels and maybe buy meals too. More local candidates might arrive via train or cab &mdash; and businesses usually cover those expenses as well.</p><h3> 7. Relocation expenses <br/>  </h3><p> To attract top talent, many organizations offer to pay a new hire&rsquo;s relocation expenses. Depending on where the person is moving from, these costs can add up quickly.</p><h3> 8. New equipment <br/>  </h3><p> Does your new employee need a laptop, a mobile device, or a printer? It&rsquo;s time to take out the company credit card.</p><h3> 9. Training costs <br/>  </h3><p> Great! You&rsquo;ve finally hired a new employee. Now you&rsquo;re going to have to train that person, which generally involves pulling an employee off their regular duties.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a little bit of silver lining: The first employee you hire will cost the most money, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. But thanks to economies of scale, the more people you hire, the less they&rsquo;ll cost incrementally. In any event, because of the high costs associated with hiring new employees, organizations that wish to grow should do everything within their power to strengthen their employee retention strategies.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> A couple of years ago, I was involved in a major rebranding effort for a Fortune 100 financial services firm. <br/>  </h3><p> Based on extensive research, their chief marketing officer decided their new brand positioning should be focused on \"easier.\"</p><p> Easier to do business with. Easier to conduct banking transactions. Easier to get a mortgage, car loan, or business investment from.</p><p> Sounds great, right? Problem is they weren't easy to do business with.</p><p> I knew, because I happened to be a client of the firm. When I walked in to do a simple thing like get a new debit card, I was told the process could take up to three weeks&mdash;and I'd have to give them my old card first, meaning I'd have to spend three weeks without any access to my accounts.</p><p> Unfortunately, this situation isn't all that uncommon in business. Many firms I know make their customers&mdash;existing and new&mdash;jump through endless hoops to do business with them. Just think about your average bank. Insurance firm. Car dealership. Phone company. Utility provider.</p><p> Maybe you work for one of those firms. Maybe it frustrates you. Maybe you're sitting there right now saying, \"I know. This happens to me, as well. Every time I am close to making a sale, ____ gets in the way.\"</p><p> As sellers, there is a lot we can do to make our clients' lives easier. If you do, it'll instantly set you apart from your competitors in a way that is extremely meaningful to buyers.</p><p> In the research we did for our new book, Insight Selling, we found that sales winners&mdash;those who win far more than their average share of deals&mdash;collaborate with buyers in two key ways.</p><p> First, they educate with new ideas and perspectives, and they collaborate with buyers throughout the sales process.</p><p> Second, they stand out by how they sell. Sales winners are more responsive, more proactive, and easier to buy from than second-place finishers.</p><h3> In practice, most sales winners do five things differently (and better) in terms of making sure it's easy to buy from them: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. They are accessible <br/>  </h3><p> Sales winners make it easy to reach out, connect, and start a dialogue. From publishing their contact details on their LinkedIn profile to proactively reaching out to targeted prospects, they're always open to striking up new conversations to see what value they can add and what options they can explore.</p><h3> 2. They are responsive <br/>  </h3><p> Sales winners are quick to respond to inquiries from new and existing customers alike. They take less time to respond to inbound leads and inquiries, turn around proposals faster, and get to proposals quicker.</p><p> This significantly cuts their sales cycles and gives them an early mover advantage over their competitors. And it makes it easy to deal with them&mdash;and buy from them.</p><h3> 3. They cut out complexity <br/>  </h3><p> As a buyer, the last thing you want is to make things even more complicated. Yes, I know there are several dozen configurations that could be right. Three service levels to choose from. And nine different packages that \"could be right for me.\"</p><p> But, as a buyer, I want you to tell me which one is right. Or at least help me narrow down my options to a manageable few (while avoiding costly mistakes).</p><p> Sales winners collaborate with buyers to develop the best solutions. They ask great questions, test potential scenarios, and in the end give buyers a manageable number of options to choose from&mdash;often along with a recommendation of which one is right for them.</p><h3> 4. They drive the sale forward <br/>  </h3><p> Just in case this wasn't clear: as the seller, it's your job to drive the sales process forward. Because if you don't, nobody else will.</p><p> Not in a pushy way, mind you. Simply by ensuring that each step has a logical next one, all the while maintaining momentum and ensuring you work towards a timely and logical conclusion of the sale (which will hopefully include buying, and buying from you).</p><p> And you'll be doing your buyer a favor too, because they'll appreciate someone being on top of things, moving them forward, and holding them (a little) accountable for doing what's needed to move things along.</p><h3> 5. They help buyers say \"yes\" <br/>  </h3><p> Great sellers don&rsquo;t have hang ups about asking for a decision when the time has come. There's a logical point in the sales process where the only thing left to do is make a decision. Many sellers are afraid to ask their buyers for a clear yes (or no) when that time has come.</p><p> Not sales winners. They ask for a decision when the time is right (typically right after they ask, \"Any more questions?\"), making it easy for the buyer to say \"yes\" and move forward.</p><p> Sales winners make it easy to find them and connect. They are quick to respond, and go through a step-by-step process designed to help their buyers narrow things down and make the right decision. They maintain forward momentum throughout the sales process, and&mdash;when the time is right&mdash;ask for the buyer's final decision.</p><p> Now how easy is that?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Do you remember the good old days when spending our tax refund as soon as we received it wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal? <br/>  </h3><p> The job market was stable, house values seemed to be on a never-ending climb and the stock market was booming.</p><p> We are now a lot more cautious about our spending habits and immediately booking a great vacation or buying a new flat screen TV may not be the best choice. When that money comes in, you still have to make a decision about what to do with your income tax refund.</p><h3> Tips on What to Do With Your Income Tax Refund <br/>  </h3><p> Consider your overall financial situation before you make any decisions.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t make any choices about what to do with your income tax refund unless you look at the big picture first:</p><li> Do you have an emergency fund? If so, how much do you have saved?</li><li> How secure do you feel in your job? What are your prospects for finding another one?</li><li> How much debt are you carrying?</li><h3> Evaluate your existing emergency savings fund <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ll want to have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in case of a layoff or other financial crisis. If you haven&rsquo;t been able to set aside much in the way of savings so far, use your income tax refund to start building up your reserve.</p><p> You may want to open up a low-rate line of credit to help make up for the shortfall in savings. It&rsquo;s available to you when you need it, but you will need to be disciplined enough to use the line of credit ONLY to help pay bills or emergency expenses in the event of a job loss or other financial crisis.</p><p> If you have adequate savings in place, you should look at the next best use of your income tax refund.</p><h3> Review your current debt load and make a plan for paying down debt <br/>  </h3><p> After you have reviewed your current debt load, either consolidate your loans into a one low-rate loan or start aggressively paying down any high rate loans. You would be quite surprised at how many people have no idea how much they owe and what it is actually costing them to borrow it. Most often this situation occurs because we have way too much debt and it&rsquo;s all over the place. So we need to simplify our debt.</p><p> We can do this by taking all our loan statements to our banker and ask if they can consolidate them into one, low rate, manageable loan. If you have only one loan payment, it not only makes life much simpler but also makes getting out of debt much more &lsquo;doable.&rsquo;</p><p> Now if you have some high interest rate loans that you cannot negotiate into a lower rate loan then I would highly advise you to make it a priority to start aggressively paying them down. Use your tax refund here.</p><p> What if you have already paid off your debt and have a sizeable emergency fund-then what?</p><h3> Take the income tax return and invest it <br/>  </h3><p> If you have a healthy savings account and are debt-free with the exception of your low-rate mortgage, consider investing your income tax refund. This strategy is especially sound if you happen to be in a higher tax bracket. Consider investing the funds into your RRSP to create an ever-growing nest egg. A $10,000 contribution would generate a $4,000 refund at the 40% marginal tax bracket, which you can re-invest into the RRSP again next year.</p><h3> Summary <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s important that you understand your unique financial circumstances before making any decisions.</p><p> Use the refund productively and resist the temptation to spend it on frivolous items. In the long run you will be better off having money in the bank, with little to no debt then a big-screen TV or just the memory of a two week vacation.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> In April 1989, the movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner was released to coincide with the start of baseball season. <br/>  </h3><p> The movie earned acclaim as one of the best baseball movies of the past 30 years &ndash; and left us with the memorable line &ldquo;if you build it, he will come.&rdquo;</p><p> The phrase referred to the main character&rsquo;s dream that if he built a baseball diamond in his corn field, legendary ballplayers would emerge out of the mists of time to play games in his ballpark. Just the same, over the last three years there have been many investment firms that have believed the ETP industry was a new field of dreams. Just build an ETF that captures your best investment ideas and the investors will come.</p><p> However, now that the number of ETFs in registration has soared past 1,200, the competition for investment dollars and market makers&rsquo; attention has created a less favorable playing field for would-be ETF issuers.</p><p> There are fewer openings for &ldquo;first-mover&rdquo; ideas and those that help bring ideas to market are forced to demonstrate to market makers and seed money providers that there will be enough interest in their products to get out of seed and create a profit upside in making a market.</p><p> All this explains the rapt attendees of the Spring ETP Forum&rsquo;s &ldquo;New to Market&rdquo; panel discussion, as the audience was eager to hear the secrets of how issuers behind recent successful product launches made it happen in this tough environment.</p><p> Moderated by Steve Malafronte of Recon Capital Partners, panelists Jay Rhame of Reaves Asset Management, Conor Platt of Etho Capital, Andrew Chanin of PureFunds and Nick Cherney of Janus Capital Group discussed how they were able to overcome industry challenges and launch successful niche ETFs.</p><h3> 1. Innovation <br/>  </h3><p> When looking to corner niche sectors within the market, ETF strategists and issuers need to recognize the importance of innovation and research. Andrew Chanin, CEO of our client PureFunds, noted that when developing a new product, he considers sustainable ideas as opposed to gimmicks. He also added that the success of his ETF launches hinged on the efforts of outside research experts. For example, before the recent launches of their two niche ETFs tracking the video game technology industry and the Reality Shares Drone Index, he enlisted researchers with extensive knowledge of these industries to help pinpoint companies that would fit into the ETFs&rsquo; buckets. Additionally, each of these unique ETFs brought something new and different to the marketplace that investors wanted to capitalize on.</p><h3> 2. Strategy <br/>  </h3><p> While innovation and research go a long way, success will not be found without a well-thought out marketing, media, distribution and operations strategy in place. When the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF hit the market, the team at Gregory FCA was prepared to support the launch with targeted outreach. These efforts have continued long after the initial buzz by piggybacking on breaking news surrounding developments in the cybersecurity space in real time. Additionally, issuers should identify pre-launch sources of seed capital to ensure the launch goes smoothly and to help plan for first-year revenues and expenses. Volume begets more volume in the ETF world and is a sign for investors that there is value in their investment.</p><h3> 3. Take a risk <br/>  </h3><p> No matter how much planning goes into an ETF launch, there is no guarantee that everything will work out perfectly. No one can predict how markets will react on any given day, which in turn can sway investor interest. Increased regulations and product innovations may hinder success, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that without risk there is no reward.</p><p> In short, an innovative idea and a proper strategy are key ingredients in the recipe for a successful ETF launch. In order to ensure success and reach the ETF field of dreams in today&rsquo;s competitive environment, ETF issuers must realize that their success relies on the steps they take prior to launch and be ready to take a leap of faith.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/about-us/team/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Nicole Anglace  </u> </a> Don&rsquo;t overlook Millennials as clients. There are several factors that make Millennials desirable:</p><li> We have debt (think student loans)</li><li> We will soon be entering the prime of our careers</li><li> We want to build credit</li><li> We want that fancy house with the nice yard</li><li> We want to travel</li><li> Many of us want to get married</li>Millennials make up the future of the workforce. However, it is a common perception that we lack sufficient finances and our financial issues aren&rsquo;t complex. Some industry experts feel that Millennials are not yet attractive clients for independent financial advisors because issues faced by Millennials are not complex enough to be worth such a professional&rsquo;s time.However, I disagree. Instead of being hindrances, I think that Millennial financial issues actually represent reasons why Millennials both need help and should not be overlooked as a potential client base. The following issues underscore the need for such an association:<li> We don&rsquo;t know what we are doing with our money</li><li> We have debt</li><li> We have both short-term and long-term goals</li><li> We don&rsquo;t know who to trust when it comes to financial advice</li><h3> What Money?</h3>According to a January 2016 PWC report, a fair portion of my generation (~30%) overdraft their checking accounts. This same report indicates that nearly half of the surveyed Millennials don&rsquo;t believe that they could afford to pay $2000 in the event that an emergency arose in the next month. This fact is surprising given that 86% of Millennials claim that they are actually saving money, and 20% of those saving money do so in the event of an emergency.It is likely that the documented inability to cover emergency expenses may be a result of improper budgeting, or a lack of a fully functional financial plan. In a January 2016 report <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2016/01/25/millennials-money-the-unfiltered-journey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook</a> reports that 52% of Millennials say they do not know how to go about creating a financial plan.<h3> Debt</h3>Debt is a major concern for Millennials, not only those with student loan debt.This fact isn&rsquo;t surprising as PWC notes that 2/3 of all Millennials carry at least one source of long-term debt, and roughly 1/3 of the generation, even those without college degrees, have more than one source of long-term debt.Additionally, PWC reports that 53% of Millennials carry credit card balances in the past 12 months. As PWC puts it, Millennials are &ldquo;financially fragile.&rdquo;<h3> Goals</h3>As the Millennial generation spans two decades (1980s-early 2000s), it is not surprising that we are not all focused on the same goals. Generally, younger Millennials (typically those who are between 20-30 years old) are more inclined to focus their attentions on short term goals. On the other hand, older Millennials place a greater emphasis on long-term opportunities.Short-term Goals: 43% of Millennials indicated to Facebook that their top priority is paying off debt. Roughly the same percentage of Millennials (46%) characterize financial success as being debt free. To many Millennials, reaching this level of success feels like a daunting task, especially because paying off student loan debt isn&rsquo;t our only goal&mdash;we want to do other things (travel, own a car, maybe even pursue another degree).Long-term Goals: Most Millennials don&rsquo;t properly invest in their savings. According to the Facebook IQ study, the main reasons for this underinvestment stem from the belief that not only do we not have enough money to invest properly, but also that we don&rsquo;t know enough about investing.PWC points to the fact that only 36% of Millennials have a retirement account established. Sadly, even this financial security is often compromised as 17% of those with such accounts have had to take a loan from them and 14% have taken hardship withdrawals all in the last year. Chances are, the average millennial doesn&rsquo;t have a solid grasp on the function/benefit of a Roth IRA over a traditional IRA.<h3> Advice</h3>For these individuals, the most valued source of information for all things is the internet. When we have questions, we turn to our family and peers. Unfortunately for financial advice seekers, only 24% of Millennials demonstrate basic financial literacy.Chances are, the peers who are offering advice aren&rsquo;t properly informed. Due to this lack of knowledge, the majority of Millennials (53%) admit that they don&rsquo;t have anyone to turn to for financial advice. Moreover, only 36% of Millennials talk to their parents about money.Considering the lack of reliable information, it is rather shocking that the percentage of Millennials who would consult a financial professional isn&rsquo;t higher. According to PWC, in the last year a total of ~39% of those surveyed consulted professionals: 27% sought savings/investment advice and 12% sought debt management advice.However, the total is most likely even lower, as the report does not mention the percentage of individuals who sought both kinds of advice.<h3> 3 Ways to Help Millennials</h3>The most effective way to help millennials is to have advisors who can empathize with the life stages and transitions we are going through&mdash;people who have recently gone through these themselves. Beyond hiring employees from the Millennial pool, Facebook suggests:1. Offer Millennials solutions that address our pressing needs and help them manage multiple financial priorities (e.g., paying down debt vs accumulating savings).2. Make credit a strategic tool that gives financially responsible and goal-oriented Millennials the flexibility to achieve their short-term goals faster and build the credit they&rsquo;ll need in the future.3. Make financial planning a gateway: Helping Millennials develop a financial plan now will not only provide them with a much-needed service, but it will make you a more valuable partner as you open their eyes to new financial opportunities.Millennials need your services. I know I would find such advice beneficial, and that many of my friends would as well. I recommend that you consider taking steps to add Millennials to your client base. Above all else, hiring Millennial workers is the most effective way to attract Millennial clients.",

    "content": "<h3> Each time you whip out your credit card, your purchase and how and when you pay it off contribute to your credit score. <br/>  </h3><p> That score can determine &ndash; or wreck &ndash; your ability to buy big-ticket items such as homes. If your score&rsquo;s low, here are ways to give it a boost. </p><p> The most commonly used credit score, vital to your financial health, is from Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO). Scores max out at 850. Congratulations if you&rsquo;re at that level; most people&rsquo;s score fall short of those heights.</p><p> Each lender interprets your score differently. Consensus calls any score above 750 excellent, around 650 fair and less than 600 poor.</p><p> The closer you are to 750 or above, the more likely a lender will approve you and charge you lower interest rates, possibly as much as a percentage point or more lower for every 100 points on your FICO score.</p><h3> Improving your score <br/>  </h3><p> First and most important, pay all your bills on time. Late and skipped payments can really hurt your standing.</p><p> Next, keep balances on your credit cards as low as possible. Maintaining balances that are lower than your credit limit can also raise your score.</p><p> Paying off your debt is wiser than moving debt from card to card. Pay off the credit cards with the highest interest rates first.</p><p> A wallet full of new (that is, with no balance yet) plastic may seem like a handy shopping tool. But every time you apply for and open a new credit account, your score goes down; be prudent with those unsolicited applications littering your mailbox.</p><h3> Seeing your report <br/>  </h3><p> Your FICO score summarizes your credit risk and is based on your credit report. Inspect your report at least annually.</p><p> Each year you can receive a free copy of your credit report from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.annualcreditreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.annualcreditreport.com  </a> </u> . Reports are provided from the three major credit-reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion).</p><p> The ideal credit holder, in the eyes of the agencies, holds a job for some time, owns a home or rents an apartment for several years, uses just a few credit cards and pays the balances on time. The bureaus also like cardholders who carry some balances &ndash; usually 30% or less of the credit limit &ndash; because card issuers make money from interest on those balances.</p><h3> Determine if your reports contain inaccuracies <br/>  </h3><p> Contact the reporting agencies with the correct information &ndash; incorrect information can lead to a denial of credit or your unfairly paying a higher interest rate.</p><p> Your dispute might also now have more teeth: The big three agencies recently agreed to change how they handle errors and list unpaid medical bills. Consumer advocates touted the development as the broadest credit-industry overhaul in years.</p><p> A low credit score can cost you significant time and money. Do all you can for a higher score and a winning financial life.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In what many are hailing as the most significant change to retirement planning in decades, when the U.S. Department of Labor announced a new rule that will affect how financial advisers can help you invest your 401(k) and IRA retirement accounts. This is a BIG DEAL; there&rsquo;s more than  <u>  $24 trillion </u>  worth of assets invested in American&rsquo;s retirement plans.Most importantly, the new regulation &mdash;known as the &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/three-cheers-for-the-new-rule-protecting-retirement-investors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciary rule  </a> </u> &rdquo; or, as the Obama Administration likes to call it, &ldquo;the conflict of interest rule&rdquo; &mdash; severely curtails brokers who place their own interests before their clients.In other words, brokers will no longer have the option of pushing investments that pay fat commissions rather than lower-cost alternatives that better serve clients investing for retirement. (The rule fully kicks in January 1, 2018.) As a former broker and the co-host of the PBS series,  <u>  <a href=\"http://moneytrack.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   MoneyTrack  </a> </u> , I applaud the new fiduciary standard.Conversations with advisers about investment fees will become more open and transparent as a result of the new rule, too. You might be asking: Isn&rsquo;t that how it should work? Yes, but remember, the Wall Street brokerage model was never intended to be transparent.Brokers will no longer have the option of pushing investments that pay fat commissions rather than lower-cost alternatives that better serve clients.</p><h3> Reforming How Financial Advisers Get Paid</h3>To understand the significance of the new rule (whose unveiling Labor Secretary Thomas Perez described as &ldquo;a good day for Main Street and the middle class&rdquo;), it&rsquo;s important to first appreciate the distinction between the two most common models for how financial advisers (formerly called brokers) get paid. That&rsquo;s important to understand because how your adviser earns a living can have a meaningful impact on the quality of the advice you receive.For example, if your broker is mostly paid by commissions from investments he or she sells, it means that this adviser has a sneaky, built-in incentive to persuade you to invest in the one with the highest commission. Commission-based models have been notorious for plaguing investors with hidden fees, sometimes even more than 2 to 3 percent. Alternatively, some advisers are paid by fees that are the same no matter what they recommend.How can you ever be sure your broker&rsquo;s recommendation is actually the best one for you? That&rsquo;s the problem the new rule aims to solve.The fiduciary standard &mdash; in which an adviser agrees to legally put the client&rsquo;s interest first &mdash; is a much higher bar than what a traditional Wall Street brokerage firm requires, which is merely that a recommended investment is &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for a client.This is not to say that all advice from brokers is tainted or that no brokers behave as fiduciaries. There are plenty of good brokers. The problem has been: How do you identify who&rsquo;s who? This is why throughout my professional career, I&rsquo;ve drawn my own line in the sand steering consumers toward independent registered financial advisers who can demonstrate they live up to the higher fiduciary standard.While no financial model for advisers is free of risks, paying your investment pro a retainer, an ongoing management fee or an hourly rate (rather than commissions based on particular products) mitigates the risk that he or she has an incentive to act against your best interest. Compensation through a fee for investment advice encourages transparency and opens up the conversation about the kind of advice and attention you can expect.<h3> What the Critics Say</h3>While this new rule is undoubtedly a positive for anyone interested in transparency, some on Wall Street (and in the media) feel that it will actually hurt consumers.Financial radio talk show host and author Dave Ramsey, for example, <u> tweeted</u> that the fiduciary rule will &ldquo;kill the Middle Class&rdquo; and hurt the ability of consumers to receive personal advice. And some brokers are so scared that the rule will cut into their business model, they&rsquo;re adding drama and exaggerating the impact.That said, there&rsquo;s some truth to what they say.It will be expensive for these old-world brokerage firms to comply with this new-world rule. Who&rsquo;s going to foot that bill? Individual investors using brokers will pay.Costs will go up for those who seek retirement planning advice from a broker, and some of those brokers will cut their losses by firing their smaller retirement clients. But the advice consumers do receive will become less of a sales pitch and more educational. Think: Fidelity or Schwab.<h3> Times Have Changed</h3>Consumers will be able to decide for themselves who, and how, to pay for investment advice. No one <u> <a href=\"http://www.nextavenue.org/ira-rollovers-3-questions-avoid-getting-fleeced/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  rolling over their 401(k) balance </a></u> into an IRA will be held captive to a brokerage arrangement or forced into accepting a lower standard of care.Investors may have gotten into a habit of paying commissions for advice but the model has changed. Investing is no longer as opaque or mysterious as it was decades ago.Speaking to the media about the new rule, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said: &ldquo;People took a real hit in the Great Recession through no fault of their own and they&rsquo;re climbing back, but they need and deserve every penny they worked their tails off to earn.&rdquo; I agree.",

The audience sees me telling an entertaining story, but it&rsquo;s much more than just some charming anecdote. My words are carefully chosen and practiced because my objective is to personally connect with audience members and quickly get them to a point where they are ready to absorb the important, helpful information to come.</p><p> Do you have tried and true words to effectively draw your clients and prospects into meaningful conversations from the get-go?</p><h3> People need to feel heard before they&rsquo;re ready to listen and engage with what you have to say.</h3><p> <br/> While my words are pre-planned, deliberate, and even practiced, I deliver them like it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve said them. This isn&rsquo;t hard because</p><li> I am genuinely interested in who I am speaking to,</li><li> I&rsquo;ve never said these words to them before, and</li><li> this is the first time I&rsquo;m receiving their responses to what I&rsquo;m saying. <br/>  </li><p> Effective advisors are prepared to quickly connect with their prospects and clients and genuinely express interest and care. Recognize that this doesn&rsquo;t come from off-the-cuff comments, and also realize preparing ahead doesn&rsquo;t mean delivering canned lines. We&rsquo;ve all been on the receiving end of questions from bored and disinterested people who really couldn&rsquo;t care less about our responses &ndash; what a turn-off!</p><p> Planning what you will say in advance prepares you to quickly develop rapport and get to meaningful conversation. You won&rsquo;t waste their time or yours on distracting conversational rabbit trails. Having prepared questions frees you to listen more effectively because you&rsquo;re not having to think about what to say next. You can fully tune in to what your client is saying. You&rsquo;re available to actively listen so your client feels heard. Plus, you&rsquo;re equipped to effectively drive the conversation to help them consider what they need most, rather than simply reacting to their words and hoping you&rsquo;ll eventually get to what really matters.</p><h3> To further brush up on your conversation skills and better connect with potential new clients: <br/>  </h3><li> <strong>  Challenge yourself to talk with, not to, five new people each week. </strong>  This is more than just saying hi. Engage with people, ideally about something that they find interesting. Because the person most people think about most often is themselves, that&rsquo;s a great place to start. Notice something about them and be inquisitive. Are they wearing a unique-looking piece of jewelry or item of clothing you can genuinely compliment them on? Are they looking tan in the middle of winter (maybe they&rsquo;ve been on a trip)? Don&rsquo;t be creepy, but do be curious.</li><li> <strong>  Begin with an open-ended question, requiring more than a yes or no answer. </strong>  Instead of &ldquo;Do you come here much?&rdquo; try, &ldquo;How often do you come here?&rdquo; Instead of &ldquo;Do you work around here?&rdquo; try, &ldquo;How long have you worked around here?&rdquo;</li><li> <strong>  Actually listen to their responses instead of focusing about what you&rsquo;ll say next. </strong>  We all know when someone is giving us their undivided attention; it makes us feel special and flattered. Stop focusing on what you&rsquo;ll say next, and stay focused on the person you&rsquo;re talking with so they feel truly heard. <br/>  </li><p> People are fascinating, and no two people are identical. By having your prospecting or exploratory conversation process clear in your mind, you can relax and listen. You will appeal to a lot more people and also be prepared to be most helpful to them.</p>",

    "link": "the-5-dol-fiduciary-rule-experts-every-ria-firm-should-follow",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riainabox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   RIA in a Box  </u> </a></p><p> The Department of Labor (DOL) released the final version of its new \" <u>  Fiduciary Rule </u> .\" Although it appears the general premise of the original proposed rule remains intact,  <u>  there were a number of changes </u>  the DOL made in the final rule compared to the initial April 2015 rule proposal. The most relevant changes to registered investment adviser (RIA) firms include a  <u>  <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-07925.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   best interest contract exemption (BICE)  </a> </u>  related to individual retirement account (IRA) recommendations in regards to \"level fee arrangements\" and pushing back the full compliance date to January 1, 2018. However, it's important to note that the full rule is  <u>  382 pages in total length </u>  and as more industry experts carefully review the release in detail there are likely to be some additional wrinkles revealed which could directly impact fee-based investment advisers.</p><h3> <strong>  The DOL Fiduciary Rule Impact to RIA Firms </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investment advisers already are required to act as a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-inherent-fiduciary-duty-that-an-investment-adviser-must-adhere-to\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciary  </a> </u>  to clients. Thus, the overall the impact of the new rule for RIA firms is likely to be minimal compared to broker-dealers, wirehouses, insurers, and other non-fiduciary investment product providers that traditionally charge commissions under a suitability standard. However, it's important to note that the DOL's definition of a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fi360.com/blog/post/whats-the-difference-between-sole-interests-and-best-interests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"sole interest\" fiduciary standard  </a> </u>  under the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/erisa\" target=\"_blank\">   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)  </a> </u>  is a higher standard compared to the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fi360.com/blog/post/whats-the-difference-between-sole-interests-and-best-interests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"best interests\" fiduciary standard  </a> </u>  generally required of investment advisers. Whereas federal and various state statutes may require an RIA firm to properly disclose all conflicts of interest, under the DOL fiduciary standard, investment advisers may be prohibited from having such conflicts of interest at all.</p><p> Such ERISA requirements have always been top of mind for  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.riainabox.com/blog/the-guide-to-ria-firms-and-pension-consulting-part-1-of-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   RIA firms that advise 401(k) or other company-sponsored retirement or pension plans  </a> </u> , but this new fiduciary rule is likely to require a similar standard as it relates to IRA accounts. Such a requirement will have an impact on the vast majority of traditional investment advisory firms. This will be particularly relevant when an investment adviser is providing advice in regards whether a prospective or current client should rollover funds from a 401(k) to IRA account managed by the adviser. However, RIA firms are already operating with a fiduciary standard and thus while there may be some additional requirements related to the management of individual retirement accounts, this new rule should be something that investment advisory firms can adjust to without significant challenges or cost.</p><p> Also, by pushing back the implementation time line for this new rule, it's likely that a number of the ERISA regulatory experts will be sharing more detailed guidance in the coming weeks and months to better equip investment advisory firms with a clear playbook on how to best comply. </p><p> For RIA firms looking to stay up to date and explore the new fiduciary rule in greater detail, we strongly recommend that you check out the below list of the top 5 fiduciary rule experts that every investment adviser should follow.</p><p> The Top 5 DOL Fiduciary Rule Experts for Investment Advisers to Follow</p><h3> <strong>  1.

    "content": "<h3> The Customer Experience</h3><p> <br/> How important are customer surveys? Peter Drucker&rsquo;s old saying comes to mind: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t manage what you don&rsquo;t measure.&rdquo; Those surveys can give you a lot of data that you can use to improve virtually any part of your organization. There are two important parts to a customer survey that we&rsquo;re going to cover today:</p><li> <strong>  Asking the right questions on the survey. </strong></li><li> <strong>  What to do with the answers once you get them. Here&rsquo;s a hint. If you don&rsquo;t do anything with the answers, they probably aren&rsquo;t the right questions to use on the survey. </strong> <br/>  </li><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/the-secret-to-asking-questions-correctly/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Asking the right questions  </a> </u>  should be easy, but it&rsquo;s not. The right questions aren&rsquo;t about collecting as much information as possible. It is about collecting the right information. Information that you can use. If you can&rsquo;t use it, don&rsquo;t ask for it. Otherwise, the data becomes clutter.</p><p> The second part of our survey topic is about doing something with the data you get from the surveys. This is a golden opportunity to validate your efforts or find areas to improve. And as mentioned already, if you don&rsquo;t use or can&rsquo;t figure out what to do with the information you get from the survey questions, the questions are probably irrelevant &ndash; a waste of time for both you and your customer.</p><p> While numerical surveys, like rating something on a scale of one to ten, give you great insight to overall satisfaction levels of your customers, there should be opportunity to get opinions from open-ended questions. If you&rsquo;ve been following my work, then you know that one of my favorites is what I call The One Thing Question, which goes like this:</p><h3> Is there one thing you can think of that will make doing business with us better?</h3><p> <br/> If the customer gives you great ratings and still has a good &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; suggestion, then you have an opportunity to improve on greatness. Still, any &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; suggestion is potentially a great suggestion. Furthermore, it may give you some insight into what your individual customers might want or need, allowing you to customize their experience.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s a story to illustrate this concept.</h3><p> <br/> I recently stayed at the amazing Silver Baron Lodge in Deer Valley, Utah. I had a great chat with Mary Ann Empey, the manager of the property. We talked about surveys and she shared with me a great example of how she used information to impress one of her regular guests.</p><p> This guest had stayed many times at the Silver Baron for his family ski trips. After each stay he filled out the resort&rsquo;s survey with positive ratings. Except the last time. While the ratings were still great, in response to one of the open ended questions he commented (or complained) that there weren&rsquo;t any 20 pound dumbbells in the workout room.</p><p> Mary Ann, who reads every comment card, wanted to right what the guest thought was wrong. She immediately went out and bought two 20 pound dumbbells and kept them in her office &ndash; for over a year &ndash; until the guest returned. Upon his arrival she presented the weights as a gift to the guest, who was surprised and couldn&rsquo;t have been happier.</p><p> Think about this. Good questions give you good information. It&rsquo;s what you do with the information that&rsquo;s really important. And, while the responses may give you insights to the general customer experience, sometimes it&rsquo;s the extra comments that can give you the opportunity to create a customized experience, one that endears you to the customer and gets them to come back again and again.</p>",

In February, the short-haul regional carrier Republic Airlines filed for bankruptcy&mdash;the first such filing in the industry since American&rsquo;s in 2011&mdash;after losing a number of unionized pilots in a drawn-out salary dispute. (More on that later.)</p><p> And just this past weekend, 84-year-old Alaska Airlines announced it would be buying Virgin America, billionaire Richard Branson&rsquo;s young, hip carrier.</p><h3> Alaska to Become the Premiere West Coast Carrier?</h3><p> <br/> The $2.6 billion deal, awaiting shareholder approval in June, would create the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-7-biggest-us-airlines-2016-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fifth-largest U.S. airline  </a> </u>  by traffic and result in a much more competitive player, especially on the West Coast. (Alaska is based in Seattle, Virgin in San Francisco.) According to the Wall Street Journal, Alaska&rsquo;s annual revenue could grow 27 percent because of the deal.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-alaska-airlines-plus-virgin-america-equals-one-huge-west-coast-carrier-04082016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Alaska airlines + Virgin America = One Huge West Coast Carrier\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-alaska-airlines-plus-virgin-america-equals-one-huge-west-coast-carrier-04082016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> As I&rsquo;ve pointed out in the past, the acquiree in deals such as this normally sees a short-term bump in share price, while the buyer&rsquo;s stock might fall because, among other reasons, it must pay a premium for the acquisition. For the three-month period as of April 6, Virgin was up nearly 66 percent.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-virgin-america-rallies-alaska-airlines-takeover-04082016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Virgin America Rallies on Alaska Airlines Takeover\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-virgin-america-rallies-alaska-airlines-takeover-04082016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> Integration can sometimes be tricky for airlines&mdash;more so than for other industries&mdash;because they involve not just employees and aircrafts but also information technology systems, booking procedures, rewards programs and flight schedules. All of this must be accomplished while the carriers remain fully operational.</p><p> Airlines that have gone through this often-messy process have seen their quality ratings drop off. This was certainly the case with American as it slowly integrated and digested US Airways, a two-year endeavor that concluded in October 2015.</p><p> The Alaska-Virgin deal could end up being very different, though. Both carriers have an exceptionally firm handle on their operations and provide sterling customer service. Alaska has received the highest rating in  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-north-america-airline-satisfaction-study\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   J.D. Powers&rsquo; North America Satisfaction Survey  </a> </u>  for eight consecutive years. For the fourth straight year, Virgin has held the top spot in the annual  <u>  <a href=\"http://commons.erau.edu/aqrr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Airline Quality Rating (AQR)  </a> </u>  system, developed to rank airlines based on 15 &ldquo;elements&rdquo; such as on-time arrivals, mishandled baggage and the like.</p><p> Aircraft integration between the two companies poses arguably the most significant challenge&mdash;not just for Alaska and Virgin but also for jet manufacturer Boeing. Alaska exclusively flies the Boeing 737 while Virgin operates the Airbus A320, almost all of them leased. Once the Airbus leases are up in 2020, Alaska could choose to let them go, or it might decide to keep or even expand the fleet. At some point, this could be a concern for Boeing.</p><h3> Pilot Shortage Intensifies While Demand Soars</h3><p> <br/> Nevertheless, Boeing has an unprecedented seven-year order backlog of 5,800 commercial jets. To put that number in perspective, the U.S. airline industry collectively has  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/aerospace_forecasts/\" target=\"_blank\">   6,871 jets in its commercial fleet  </a> </u>  right now, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Because of increased passenger and cargo demand, this number is expected to reach at least 8,400 by 2036.</p><p> <img alt=\"Boeing Has a 7 Year Production Backlog\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-boeing-has-7-year-production-backlog-04082016.jpg\"/></p><p> This raises the question of who will be flying these additional aircrafts.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve previously written about  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/these-signs-point-to-an-airline-industry-secular-bull-market\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   the imminent pilot shortage  </u>  , </a>  which was spurred on by new FAA rules that tightened pilot training and service. Pilots must now retire when they reach 65, and they must have at least 1,500 hours of flight time before they can be considered for a position&mdash;usually with a regional carrier such as Republic for a starting salary close to $20,000. While Republic was trying to negotiate a new labor contract, it was losing about 40 pilots a month, according to Bloomberg.  </p><p> This has contributed to an industrywide pilot shortage that could intensify as more and more pilots retire, with fewer and fewer new pilots to replace them. It also has the effect of encouraging capacity growth discipline.</p><p> Meanwhile, commercial flight demand, both here and abroad, continues to climb. According to the Transportation Department, the number of passengers carried by U.S. airlines and foreign airlines serving the U.S. reached an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/press_releases/bts018_16\" target=\"_blank\">   all-time high of 895.5 million  </a> </u>  in 2015, a 5 percent increase from the previous year.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-record-number-of-passengers-served-in-2015-04082016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Record Number of Passengers Served in 2015\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-08/COMM-record-number-of-passengers-served-in-2015-04082016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> Passenger traffic in the  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/slideshows/explore-the-8-busiest-airports-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   world&rsquo;s busiest airport  </u>  , </a>  Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, also grew 5.5 percent year-over-year in 2015 to reach a record-breaking  <a href=\"http://www.aci.aero/News/Releases/Most-Recent/2016/04/04/ACI-releases-preliminary-world-airport-traffic-rankings-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  100 million passengers, </a>  according to Airports Council International (ACI).</p><p> By the way, I want to congratulate Brussels Airport for (partially) reopening following the devastating attacks last month.

What&rsquo;s more, they generate $1.6 trillion in goods and services and provide 7.6 million jobs&mdash;4.3 percent of all U.S. jobs&mdash;that pay workers a combined total of $453 billion.</p><h3> Clearly we depend on airports, but how are they funded? In a word: munis.</h3><p> <br/> American airports as a whole have capital needs that average $14.3 billion per year, according to ACI estimates. The FAA annually provides $3.35 billion, leaving a difference of $10.95 billion. About 54 percent of that amount is typically funded with general obligation (GO) bonds and other municipal bonds that are tax-free at the federal level and often at the state and local levels.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> A catastrophic societal and familial tsunami is coming that will forever alter the basic fabric of our families and communities. <br/>  </h3><p> It is no longer a question of &lsquo;if&rsquo; it will happen or &lsquo;when&rsquo; but right now, we need to address the questions of &lsquo;what&rsquo; we can do to mitigate the impact and &lsquo;how&rsquo; to preserve what we still possess. The wisdom that has been passed downfrom generation to generation, typically through stories shared by elders with their young around the dinner table or at family gatherings is no longer happening. </p><p> Through advances in medicine and health care we are living longer. Our affluence has allowed for greater mobility and our technology has enabled us to stay in touch despite geographical separation. The extended family and the benefit provided is becoming extinct. We are communicating more but connecting less. The wisdom gained through sharing stories of life experience and expressions of deeply held values cannot be conveyed with 140 characters in a tweet.</p><p> The damage wrought by these changes in the family dynamic can be found in many places but very clearly defined by an adage familiar to Succession Planners: </p><h3> Shirt Sleeves to Shirt Sleeves in Three Generations <br/>  </h3><p> This adage and the problem it defines is not confined to our culture and country as versions of the same can be found in many cultures and countries. But there can be an antidote for this condition. Wealth, divorced from the wisdomthat created it is sure to be wasted. Estate and Succession Planning has done a tremendous job of passing the &lsquo;cake&rsquo; to future generations, but unfortunately in too many cases, the &lsquo;recipe&rsquo; is taken to the grave. </p><p> If there is a hope for those descendants to whom the wealth passes, to shoulder the responsibility of preserving and perpetuating that wealth, they need to be vested in the Family Narrative. But how can they be vested when they don&rsquo;t know that narrative.</p><p> Family histories are an important vehicle through which to create this feeling of connectedness and an &ldquo;intergenerational self.&rdquo;  While the process of expressing family histories should not be limited to a particular time of year, a holiday season in which many families get together may provide an opportunity to begin to share a family narrative.  The development of this narrative has the potential to serve as the scaffolding for adding meaning to the life of each family member.</p><p> The public overwhelmingly wants to do something to preserve and pass on their life lesson and values more so even than passing on their wealth as reflected in the Allianz American Legacies Pulse Survey by a factor of 8 to 1. But it&rsquo;s NOT happening. </p><h3> What&rsquo;s at Stake? <br/>  </h3><p> The amount of wealth set to cross generation lines is arguable, being cited as anywhere from $30 to $59 Trillion. Regardless of the amount the outcome is predictable:</p><p> Over the next 30 years, an epic $30 trillion will be passed down from baby boomers to Generation X to millennials. In that enormous transfer of wealth, many investment advisers will see their hard-earned asset base evaporate &mdash; and the value of their firms plummet &mdash; because they don't know how to connect with their clients' children. The problem is especially difficult for the many advisers ill-equipped to connect with clients who are technology savvy and expect a very different service experience than their parents did.</p><p> The simple, undeniable truth is this: Sixty-six percent of children fire their parents' financial adviser after they inherit their parents' wealth.</p><p> Advisers unable to prove they are effective at establishing relationships with clients' children and serving the next generation also will discover their businesses are worth less to potential buyers, experts said. </p><p> Relationships are built over time and the time to build the bridge to the surviving spouse and succeeding generations is before it&rsquo;s needed. When it comes to the surviving spouse, their priorities are often different, family relationships matter more than return on investments. Advisors who do not recognize this disparity or offer guidance to strengthen the familial bond will be replaced.</p><h3> Responding to this lopsided situation <br/>  </h3><p> Legacy Stories has spent the past decade working within the Elder Care Continuum, with professionals and care recipients. The object was not to find more reasons for people to build a meaningful legacy, but to find the reasons why they don&rsquo;t. The result of our study is embodied in our state of the art technology platform, programs, protocols, and tools.</p><p> Our purpose is not only to raise awareness of this problem and its solution but to also build a network of professionals to provide advice and guidance. If we can get people to understand the problem and help them take the first steps in rectifying, we stand a fighting chance subsequent steps will be taken.</p><p> <a href=\"http://LegacyStories.Org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   LegacyStories.Org  </u> </a> has built a comprehensive, self-guided Legacy Building platform that encourages and empowers clients to begin this rewarding process. Advisors don&rsquo;t need to be actively engaged to reap the benefit of a deeper and more enhanced client relationship. The program also offers significant marketing / branding tools to attract new clients.</p><p> Professional advisors: Estate, Succession and Financial Planners need to adopt a more holistic approach when advising clients. Regardless how effectively you perform as a tool to protect and increase wealth, building a legacy builds a bridge to the future. And in the end, Builders are embraced, and tools get replaced.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Those of us who work with business owners often hear the following responses when we suggest that they create an Exit Plan:</p><li> &ldquo;Exit? I just want some freedom to do whatever I want, whenever I want.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Why would I even think about selling? I can&rsquo;t get enough for it in today's merger and acquisition marketplace, my employees don&rsquo;t have the cash and my kids aren&rsquo;t interested.&rdquo;</li><li> &ldquo;Even if I could get the price I want, where could I invest and generate a reasonable rate of return or one that matches what I&rsquo;m getting from my business?&rdquo;</li><p> I find that many owners justifiably consider their businesses to be one of the best &ldquo;stocks&rdquo; in their portfolios. They see less risk in keeping their businesses than they do investing in the stock market.</p><h3> The issue for many owners then is: how do I back away and let others run the business without transferring ownership and control? <br/>  </h3><p> The fundamental function of Exit Planning is creating a business that can be transferred to another with minimal disruption to cash flow when the owner departs. Thus you can answer this question by engaging in the Exit Planning process, with no intent of exiting, but of simply to create a business that can operate without you and without disrupting its cash flow.</p><p> Traditional Exit Planning can either help you to orchestrate a successful, permanent exit or to forge a path toward an exit without giving up ownership. Or both.</p><p> <strong>  To reach your goal of maintaining ownership while reducing or even eliminating your involvement in the business, you should: </strong></p><li> Establish your (owner-based) on-going business objectives.</li><li> Determine future cash flow needs for yourself and for your business.</li><li> Build a stronger business--one capable of running without you</li><p> Not so coincidently, these are also the first three steps in creating an Exit Plan.</p><h3> Let's look briefly at each component <br/>  </h3><p> First, working with your Exit Planning Advisor, establish your timetable for backing away from your business. Communicate your wishes clearly: What does backing away mean to you in terms of time commitment, emotional involvement, financial guarantees, etc.?</p><p> Second, determine the amount of income that you need the business to provide you. Ask members of your Advisory Team to help you.</p><p> Third, the characteristics of a &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; business (one that can run without its owner) are the same characteristics third-party cash buyers look for. A company that can be managed from a distance and has sustainable and increasing cash flow with little risk of nose-diving without its owner at the controls, is a highly-attractive business. It is valuable both to third parties and to the owner who wants to step away.</p><p> <strong>  To create a valuable business, you should have in place critical Value Drivers including: </strong></p><li> Steadily increasing cash flow.</li><li> Operating systems that improve sustainability of cash flows.</li><li> Strong management team.</li><li> A diverse customer base.</li><p> The most valuable businesses are those in which the owners are no longer valuable.</p><p> Planning to step away while maintain ownership is Exit Planning. The Exit Planning Process provides the roadmap you need to create a business that you can keep or sell. The choice is yours.</p>",

    "content": "<p> From on-site gyms and daycare facilities to competitive salaries and creative incentive packages, today&rsquo;s organizations are increasingly doing everything in their power to attract and retain talented employees.</p><p> One area many companies neglect, however, is career development.</p><p> Exceptional employees want exceptional careers that challenge and inspire them. They want to feel motivated and interested on a consistent basis &ndash; and it is this continual investment that translates into higher retention and profitability for the company.</p><p> Career pathing programs offer a proven path to such motivation, but their many benefits are only seen if the programs are set up effectively.</p><h3> Here are four things every successful career pathing program has in common: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. They encourage vision <br/>  </h3><p> What can a talented employee accomplish inside your company? Where can he go? What can she do? A successful career pathing program reduces boredom and increases engagement by helping employees imagine exponential growth &ndash; professionally and personally.</p><h3> 2. They provide scaffolding <br/>  </h3><p> What will it take an employee to realize their professional dreams? What does she need to know to move from one job role to another? What experience does he need to obtain? A career pathing program that builds and retains top talent offers numerous mentoring and training opportunities for employees who want to embrace new challenges.</p><h3> 3. They incorporate competencies <br/>  </h3><p> Mentoring, visioning, and planning aren&rsquo;t enough for success if employees don&rsquo;t know of and excel in the competencies required for success in their specific fields and positions. What characteristics do the outstanding performers in each position possess? What behaviors are crucial for success?

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> I was approached by an organization this week to help them deal more effectively with conflict amongst their teams. <br/>  </h3><p> It seems that the company had gone through a few mergers that resulted in disconnected teams as well as discontented team members. In particular there appeared to be little communication between supervisors, as each was holding on to their ways of planning and executing. It was even described to me as: &ldquo;Old timers want to keep the old mindset.&rdquo; Not a very positive way to look at working though issues.</p><p> Thinking about how to approach this organization&rsquo;s issues, I began to get a tightening in my stomach. I questioned what the real challenges were and why they were happening.</p><p> After speaking with some of the people in the company, I came to realize that they had gone from a small, more family type culture to a bigger workplace with many diverse backgrounds. Team members were fearful to bring up their concerns so issues got pushed aside-or so they thought.</p><p> Here are five strategies to overcome conflict between seasoned team members and new team players:</p><h3>  1. ADMIT THE PROBLEM <br/>  </h3><p> The first step that this organization has to take, which they are taking, is being honest about the team conflict. Take a hard look at what is happening and why. If team members are feeling afraid to speak up and share their concerns, leadership has to be aware and address that. If some people who have been in a company for a long time are missing the camaraderie of a family culture, then tackle that. Whatever is the real disconnect, make sure to allow it to emerge.</p><h3> 2. BRING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER <br/>  </h3><p> Whether a team member is seasoned or a newbie, both perspectives are critical to the success of an organization. That means, set up time to pull everyone together and learn about one another.</p><li> Share some personal stories</li><li> Identify what each member feels is important to keep</li><li> Discuss the pros and cons of the changes</li><li> Allow people to vent</li><h3> 3. CREATE A PROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE <br/>  </h3><p> If communication is iffy at best, then work on ways to develop effective strategies. Using clear, open and respectful language is so essential when sharing responsibilities and roles. Listen and then listen some more to what each individual is really saying. Make sure there is understanding and clarity.</p><h3> 4. LEARN FROM EACH OTHER <br/>  </h3><p> Commit to being open to learning from everyone-seasoned and newbie alike.</p><li> Have the &ldquo;old timers&rdquo; roll out why certain procedures work for them</li><li> Encourage newbies to explain how they might improve the process</li><li> Develop mentoring and reverse mentoring programs and pair team members with people with different views from theirs</li><li> Try not to prejudge or make decisions before hearing one another out</li><h3> 5. FORM A NEW TEAM SPIRIT <br/>  </h3><p> The ultimate goal is to create a new team culture and spirit that captures both vantage points of the seasoned team members and the newbies. Decide on what  <a href=\"http://terriklassconsulting.com/2015/12/20/five-values-that-can-transform-leaders/#sthash.bGe97EfL.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  values </a>  are most important and when conflict comes up, be willing to work through it with respect and care for one another. Empower each person on the team to lead from wherever they are.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> To most of us, the phrase Work that Matters infers job satisfaction. <br/>  </h3><p> The outcome is lower stress, lower turnover, and higher productivity &ndash; in business, a &lsquo;win-win&rsquo; for employees, customers and shareholders. The logic is infallible.</p><p> So, I ask you, why is there such a gap between the theory and the practice? Why are so many organizations and so many workers struggling to find workplace nirvana? </p><p> Work that Matters is a key success factor for every business. But, as a concept it is no different than a long list of other key success factors that organizations strive to achieve. We read about these factors in the quintessential mission statements that occupy real estate in annual reports and gather dust in reception lobbies.</p><p> Companies say they want to be customer-centric, to be innovative, to produce outstanding products and services, to be environmentally responsible, to be socially responsible, and so on. But, they continue to fall short of these superlatives. Herein lies the difference between objectives and strategy.</p><h3> Matters that Work <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s impossible to find Work that Matters without implementing Matters that Work. Some of these matters are the responsibility of the company, others are shared between the company and the employee.</p><p> Without 5 core prerequisites in place, Work that Matters will be continue to be elusive. </p><h3> 1. Matters of Vision <br/>  </h3><p> The starting place is a corporate purpose that will not only resonate with employees, it will bind them together. Sure, we&rsquo;d all prefer a moral purpose, such as working for a company that is saving lives or saving the planet. But, that&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t be inspired by a company vision that thrills customers the way Zappos does.</p><h3> 2. Matters of Values <br/>  </h3><p> For the nearly 5,000 employees who work at L.L. Bean, the idea of selling really good merchandise at a reasonable profit and treating customers like human beings is worth the effort. For Wegman&rsquo;s Food Markets, it&rsquo;s all about caring, high standards, making a difference, respect, and empowerment. Those who walk the talk create Work that Matters.</p><h3> 3. Matters of Teamwork <br/>  </h3><p> Teamwork is more than the ability to work together toward a common goal. It is the opportunity and a privilege to do so &ndash; a matter of allowing ordinary people to achieve extraordinary results. When they do this, they collectively celebrate the results.</p><h3> 4. Matters of Excellence <br/>  </h3><p> If you strive for mediocrity, you&rsquo;ll never be happy in your work. Likewise, if you strive for excellence in an organization that blocks your ability to realize excellence, you&rsquo;ll never be happy in your work. A matter of excellence is a shared responsibility. The company must create an environment in which achievers can achieve.</p><h3> 5. Matters of Focus <br/>  </h3><p> Is vision, values, teamwork, and excellence, enough? Not if you are working on a plethora of matters that aren&rsquo;t adding value. So why do you do them? Is it because you cling to tasks that make you feel busy or important? Look at your daily tasks and decide which ones can either be dropped, delegated, or outsourced. Ultimately, when you do less, better, you&rsquo;ll find yourself doing more of the things that make a difference.</p><p> Of course, there&rsquo;s a lot more to job satisfaction than these five core prerequisites. That said, for those keen to realize a more human way to do business, the starting place is rather simple.</p><p> Seek out organizations who know that happy employees make for happy customers, and that happy customers make for happy shareholders. These companies are easy to find, but job vacancies in those organizations? Not so much, for the obvious reason. </p>",

    "title": "The Most Common Opportunities Missed on Tax Returns",
    "link": "the-most-common-opportunities-missed-on-tax-returns",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> I&rsquo;m not sure about you, but we haven&rsquo;t met many people that wouldn&rsquo;t love to lower their tax payments. <br/>  </h3><p> As we move in to the heart of tax season, do you find yourself wondering every year around this time, what other opportunities you may be missing?</p><p> Millions of people who file their tax return themselves overlook tax opportunities each year that could save them extra money in April but they hesitate to pay to have a professional prepare them.  </p><p> The hidden secret is that tax planning should be done year round. So we put together a list of a few things we see most often missed on tax returns. </p><h3> Maxing Tax-Deferred Savings <br/>  </h3><p> One of the easier ways of avoiding tax now, is to save the maximum amount in all your tax-deferred accounts (401k/403b).  Many have a tough time reaching the maximum savings limit ($18k per person in 2016).  This often brings the focus back to your cash flow as overspending keeps many from hitting the maximum amount.  Those over age 50 have an extra benefit where they can save $6,000 more each year until they stop working.</p><h3> Not Funding HSA accounts <br/>  </h3><p> This is an  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/hsamaybebestretirementaccount/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   excellent retirement account  </a> </u>  that offers a triple tax saving opportunity.  Problem is many aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of it. If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, you have an opportunity to sock away savings tax-free, that can grow tax-free and then be withdrawn tax-free.</p><h3> Non-deductible IRA contributions &amp; Roth conversions <br/>  </h3><p> High income earners still  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.financialsymmetry.com/high-earners-can-still-get-roth-ira/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have a way to make Roth contributions  </a> </u> . It just takes a few extra steps and involves some monitoring to do it successfully.  If you already have nondeductible IRA contributions, this is a great opportunity to get these contributions in to a Roth IRA, assuming you don&rsquo;t have a larger deductible portion already built up (consider the  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/timing-roth-ira-conversions-avoid-prorata-rule/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  pro rata rule in this case </a> ). Don&rsquo;t forget to fill out form 8606 to keep an accurate record of your nondeductible IRA contributions.</p><h3> Charitable Deduction Opportunities <br/>  </h3><p> If you have large capital gains from appreciated stock, it may benefit you to donate these shares instead of making cash charitable contributions. Another opportunity for those who are over age 70 &frac12;, is to make a Qualified IRA Charitable Distribution which also qualifies as Required Minimum Distribution.  This benefits you by not increasing Adjusted Gross Income on your tax return which in turn helps with medical expense deductions, social security taxation and Medicare rates to name a few.</p><h3> Missing Any Deductions? <br/>  </h3><p> Some of the more common we see left off of Schedule A are car taxes, investment fees, and charitable donations. Go through your potential itemized deductions. Look at the prior year return for some guidance. Also, if you made a 2014 estimated payment to the state in January of this year and/or owed when you filed your 2014 state tax return then you can add those payments as a federal tax deduction on this year&rsquo;s return.</p><p> If in a low bracket, you may want to delay deductions and accelerate income instead. When your AGI ends up in the 15% tax bracket, capital gains are taxed at 0%. So realizing gains could be beneficial here.</p><p> High tax bracket earners have an opposite focus as they are looking to reduce income. Word of warning: watch the Medicare Surcharge (3.8%) on income over $200k for individuals and $250k for joint filers. If you find yourself in this area, you may want to look for ways to delay income depending on the control you have in your income.</p><h3> AGI thresholds You Don&rsquo;t Want to Miss <br/>  </h3><p> Child tax credit (begins phasing out at $110k). Can you make a deductible traditional IRA contribution? This could actually reduce your tax bracket from a boosted higher rate as you are not only reducing the ordinary income tax but getting an extra benefit due to the credit.</p><li> Itemized deduction limitations over $309k (single $258,250) &ndash; especially if restricted stock or stock options are vesting and you are selling in that tax year.</li><li> American Opportunity Tax Credit phases out at $160k AGI ($80k single). If you pay for the first $4k of college expenses, you can use this credit (mentioned below).</li><h3> ACA subsidy tax bubble <br/>  </h3><p> Many retirees who no longer have an employer continued health plan and haven&rsquo;t yet reached 65 now have a new option &ndash; buying medical insurance through the health insurance marketplace. Depending on the tax diversification in your investment accounts, some early retirees are receiving premium tax credits. But be careful, if receiving the credit and your income rises above 400% of the Federal Poverty Level for the number of people in your household, you could lose all the credit.</p><p> In this situation, managing tax brackets become vital.  But to do so, you need to have saved in accounts with tax flexibility. Tara Signal Benard summarized a breakdown of this strategy in a New York Times article titled, &ldquo; <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/your-money/devising-a-tax-strategy-after-the-paycheck-is-no-more.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">   Devising a Tax Strategy After the Paycheck Is No More  </a> </u> .&rdquo;</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Forget About Other Credits <br/>  </h3><li> Pay for first $4k of tuition first to get AOTC &ndash; 3 million people missed this credit in 2014.</li><li> Residential energy credit for any HVAC replacement or energy efficient upgrade to house</li><li> Foreign Tax Credit &ndash; you lose this credit with foreign stock in IRA accounts. This is why asset location is important. Vanguard found this can add up to 0.75% per year in performance. $7,500 for a $1 million portfolio.</li><li> Dependent care credit &ndash; If both spouses are working, don&rsquo;t forget to include summer camp costs as this is very likely a deduction.</li><h3> Feeling Like you Missed Something? <br/>  </h3><p> If you feel a bit lost after reading these examples then look to hire a professional. Tax return for families can range from $300 to $500 depending on your situation. Could be money well spent if they find tax savings you overlooked.</p><p> When digging in to the numbers CNBC found the more you make the more interesting IRS auditors find you. The IRS begins to get more interested in those earning more than $200k. According to turbotax &ndash; only 1 percent earning less than that are audited. If you are over the $200k threshold, then 4% of your group will be audited. It&rsquo;s not until you begin earning more than a million, to where 12.5% get an audit notification letter.</p><p> If you feel like you would like a second look, we&rsquo;d encourage you to find a fee-only financial planner who has knowledge in the tax planning area. It&rsquo;s very likely it could be worth it.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The year 2015 was a huge year for the LGBT community. <br/>  </h3><p> Although the community and its allies ecstatically welcomed the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that effectively made gay marriage legal throughout the United States, the decision sparked some backlash among businesses and members of the public.</p><p> There have been highly publicized debates over whether small, privately held businesses should be required to serve homosexual couples.</p><p> In August, for example, a Colorado baker refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Forcing these businesses to make a wedding cake or floral arrangement for a same-sex wedding violates the religious freedom of business owners who may be opposed to such unions because of their faith, some businesses say.</p><p> And some state and local governments agree. It&rsquo;s not only low-level county officials like the Kentucky clerk of courts who was jailed for denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant recently signed a bill into law that allows businesses and religious groups to deny a variety of services to members of the LGBT community.</p><p> Just when there seemed to be a strong movement toward meaningful inclusiveness, the country seems to be taking two steps back.</p><h3> Case in point <br/>  </h3><p> Charlotte, North Carolina, recently passed a city ordinance allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. If you were born a man, but identify as a woman, you would be free to use the women&rsquo;s restroom. Almost immediately after the ordinance passed, Governor Pat McCrory, in a rare emergency session, signed into law a measure banning cities from protecting such rights.</p><p> In response to the North Carolina decision, PayPal, one of the world&rsquo;s largest online payment systems, cancelled plans to open a new global operations center in Charlotte. The CEOs of other organizations, from Apple to the NBA, have also voiced strong criticism against such lack of inclusiveness.</p><p> Why? As North Carolina furniture maker Mitchell Gold told NPR in an interview on April 3, &ldquo;(this law banning cities from protecting LGBT rights) makes it more difficult, not less difficult to hire the very best talent.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s not just the members of the LGBT community who feel marginalized.</p><p> Enacting legislation to restrict the rights of one group sends ominous signals and negative messages to other groups. If local business leaders and government officials don&rsquo;t like transgender people here, what will they think about other groups like African Americans, Muslims and immigrants? As Gold points out, it&rsquo;s already difficult to attract top talent. Why push entire segments of the population away to exacerbate the problem?</p><p> Our relentless drumbeat continues: inclusion is a business imperative! Be inclusive!</p>",

If you want to get ahead and stay ahead you need to communicate your message clearly, effectively and persuasively. You need to get people to follow your call-to-action.</p><p> Chances are you&rsquo;re not blowing them away with your communication skills. </p><p> If you&rsquo;ve been reading my articles you know that only very recently have the situations we&rsquo;ve been confronted with been much more anxiety ridden than any time in our history. By far. And you know that our brains haven&rsquo;t caught up.</p><p> How many times have you walked away from a situation and realized that you were well-equipped to deal with it but for some reason it didn&rsquo;t come out right? There&rsquo;s no surprise there. Our brains go into a version of &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; when we get nervous. Being interviewed on a podcast. Interviewing others on a podcast. Going on a job interview or giving a presentation.</p><h3> <strong>  How to Sound Amazing </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Just know that you can sound amazing <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s much easier than you think. It&rsquo;s super easy, actually. The problem is most people think speaking better is going to be hard &amp; they put a lot of effort into it. The truth is you must do the exact opposite! You have to be completely relaxed &amp; use no effort.</p><h3> 2. Stop over-articulating! <br/>  </h3><p> I can hear you over there! Using choppy speech with too many popped consonants! Solution: Divide your speech into breath groups&ndash;or units of meaning and glue all of the sounds together without the awful chop!</p><h3> 3. Use a varied intonation pattern <br/>  </h3><p> Choose the words that are most important for your listener to hear and make them longer in duration and louder in volume. Take the other words, the &ldquo;grammar glue&rdquo; and make them shorter and quieter. Grammar glue are your articles (the, a), prepositions, pronouns, etc. Use contractions whenever possible. I know it&rsquo;s counter-intuitive. Just do it.</p><h3> 4. Practice the easy stuff first <br/>  </h3><p> You can&rsquo;t obtain new skills and then apply them to all areas of your life at once. Pick your battles and improve them first. Once you master the easy levels you have a rung on your ladder on which to stand. Then it makes it easier to master the not-so easy speaking situations.</p><p>  </p>",

    "link": "how-liquid-alternatives-perform-in-up-versus-down-markets",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Volatility spikes that accompanied the financial crisis of 2008 and multiple risk-off events since &ndash; think U.S. debt ceiling crisis in 2011, Greece and China more recently &ndash; have led investors to seek &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; or non-correlated assets to better diversify their portfolios. Liquid alternatives (liquid alts) have answered this siren call of investors, giving them access to hedge-fund like, alternative investment managers but with the liquidity benefits of mutual funds or ETFs. The ostensible goal of these alternative vehicles is to help protect investment portfolios against sharp downturns while also participating in positive markets &ndash; providing &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; returns, if you may.</p><p> The most common refrain you hear regarding alternatives is that they have low &lsquo;beta&rsquo;, which essentially measures the volatility of a strategy relative to the market, and often thought of as a proxy for risk. However, we pointed out in a previous  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/understanding-alternative-investing-through-asymmetric-payoffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   post  </a> </u>  that investors should be wary of using beta as a measure of risk, since it downplays the actual risks that are taken. We looked at historical hedge fund returns and saw how the volatility and diversification benefits that alternative strategies offer comes from altering the payoff structure when markets go up, as opposed to taking on different risks.</p><p> In other words, your typical alternative strategy acts similar to a covered call strategy, in which an investor sells away upside exposure to protect part of the downside. The payoff structure is concave &ndash; with higher beta in down markets and lower beta in up markets.</p><p> The question is whether this characteristic has carried over to the universe of liquid alts.</p><h3> <strong>  The Payoff Structure of Liquid Alternatives </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> We use the universe of Morningstar&rsquo;s  <u>  <a href=\"http://news.morningstar.com/fund-category-returns/multialternative/$FOCA$GY.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   multi-alternative  </a> </u>  mutual funds, as a proxy for liquid alts. However, we use daily data as opposed to monthly data (as in our  <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/understanding-alternative-investing-through-asymmetric-payoffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  previous post </a> ), which gives us a large sample of data for each fund. We consider only those funds that had been around for at least three years as of December 31st 2015, and include only the institutional share class for those funds with multiple share classes. We found fifty-nine funds with available daily data (from  <u>  <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yahoo! Finance  </a> </u> ) between 2013 and 2015.</p><p> Before we look at the payoff structure for liquid alts, it will help to establish a baseline i.e. something we can compare the results to. For this purpose, we use daily data for the PowerShares Buy-Write S&amp;P 500 ETF ( <u>  <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/investors/etfs/product-detail?productId=PBP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   ticker: PBP  </a> </u> ), which tracks an index measuring the total rate of return on an S&amp;P 500 covered call strategy. The strategy involves:</p><li> Holding a long position indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index, and</li><li> Selling a succession of near-term at-the-money, or slightly out-of-the-money, call options on the S&amp;P 500 index. <br/>  </li><p> Quite obviously, one would expect the payoff structure in this case to be concave &ndash; since selling a call option caps the upside while still keeping most of the downside. The following scatter plot, relating the ETFs daily returns to corresponding returns for the S&amp;P 500 index (market), confirms the behavior, with a best-fit curve having a negative coefficient on the quadratic (squared) term.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pbp-vs-sp500-daily-data.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"pbp vs sp500 - daily data\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pbp-vs-sp500-daily-data.png\"/> </a></p>Scatter plot of Buy-Write ETF (PBP) daily returns versus market (S&amp;P 500 index) daily returns. Market returns are on the x-axis. Daily data obtained from <u> <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Yahoo! Finance </a></u>.<br/> <p> The concave nature of the payoff structure can be better seen when you look at realized betas in strong up markets versus strong down markets. We define an &lsquo;up-market&rsquo; as a day when the S&amp;P 500 index rises by 0.5% or more and a &lsquo;down-market&rsquo; as a day when the S&amp;P 500 falls by 0.5% or more. Days in between, when market returns were between -0.5% and 0.5%, are considered as &lsquo;flat&rsquo;.</p><p> There were 756 trading days during the three years between 2013 and 2015, of which 193 days (~ 26%) fell into our definition of an up-market, while 145 days (~ 19%) classify as down-markets. The following table shows the beta of the buy-write ETF over the entire three year period, as well as the beta in up-markets and down-markets. We&rsquo;ve also included a few other asset classes, proxied by ETFs, in the table for comparison.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benchmark-ETF-betas-2013-2015.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"benchmark ETF betas 2013-2015\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benchmark-ETF-betas-2013-2015.png\"/> </a></p>Realized beta values for different asset class ETFs, calculated using daily data (source:<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Yahoo! Finance</a>) between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2015. Up-Market defined as days when S&amp;P 500 returns are greater than or equals +0.5%. Down-Market defined as days when S&amp;P 500 returns equal or are lower than -0.5%.<br/> <p> As you would expect, the buy-write ETF has a higher beta when the market falls (0.99) versus days when the market rises significantly (0.80). Interestingly, the betas for some of the other &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; asset classes, like REITs, commodities and Gold, also have higher betas in down-markets than in up-markets. This hints at what we should expect when we look at the liquid alts universe.</p><p> The average beta for all fifty-nine liquid alt funds over the three years was 0.26. At the same time, the average beta in down-markets rose to 0.29, which is almost 50% higher than the average beta in down-markets.</p><p> Of the fifty-nine liquid alts funds that we consider here, only four had a realized beta in up-markets that was larger than their realized beta in down-markets (of which one had an up-market and down-market beta within 2% of each other). All the remaining fifty-five funds had higher betas in down-markets.</p><p> We also broke the funds down into quartiles of their overall period beta and the result remains in each case, as the next table shows.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/liquid-alts-betas-2013-2015.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"liquid-alts betas 2013-2015\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/liquid-alts-betas-2013-2015.png\"/> </a></p>Realized beta values averaged across fifty-nine mutual funds in Morningstar&rsquo;s multi-alternative universe, calculated using daily data (source:<a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Yahoo! Finance</a>) between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2015. Up-Market defined as days when S&amp;P 500 returns are greater than or equals +0.5%. Down-Market defined as days when S&amp;P 500 returns equal or are lower than -0.5%.<br/> <p> The quartile results in the table indicate that the overall average values are not skewed by a few outlier funds. In each quartile, the overwhelming majority of funds have a higher exposure to down-markets than up-markets.</p><p> The concave payoff structure of these liquid alt funds is readily apparent in the following chart, which is a scatter plot of the daily returns averaged across all fifty-nine funds versus corresponding returns for the S&amp;P 500 index (market).</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/liquid-alts-vs-sp500-daily-data.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"liquid alts vs sp500 - daily data\" src=\"http://www.convexcm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/liquid-alts-vs-sp500-daily-data.png\"/> </a></p>Scatter plot of average daily returns for fifty-nine liquid alt mutual funds versus market (S&amp;P 500 index) daily returns. Market returns are on the x-axis. Daily data obtained from <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Yahoo! Finance</a>.<br/> <p> As in the case of the buy-write ETF that we saw earlier, the best-fit curve shows a concave profile, with a negative coefficient on the squared term.</p><p> We saw above that the average liquid alt fund has a beta of 0.26, which puts it right in line with the traditional definition of alternatives. Yet, this masks an important characteristic of these funds, which is that their beta is actually higher when equity markets fall (0.29), as opposed to when the market rises (0.20).</p><p> It appears that liquid alts have maintained the chief characteristic of their hedge-fund kin, namely, higher exposure in down markets than in up markets. Understanding this is crucial to investing in alternatives, in that the average alternative fund is not taking different risks. Instead, it achieves its volatility and diversification benefits by altering the payoff structure when markets go up. Essentially, upside exposure is exchanged for a premium, which protects part of the downside, but crucially, not all of it. In a future post I will tackle some of the consequences of this feature, i.e. whether concavity is good or bad.</p>",

Roarty, CFA </a>  and  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/en/author/James_T._Tierney,_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  James T. Tierney, JR. </a></p><p> When the market is fixated on short-term macroeconomic trends, investors should think differently. Look for companies and industries that benefit from distinctive long-term growth trends and that aren&rsquo;t held hostage by a country&rsquo;s macroeconomic fortunes.</p><p> Economic growth trends are always in the headlines. In recent years, as the US economic recovery has continued at a moderate pace, persistent concerns that a slowdown or recession is imminent have often grabbed investors&rsquo; attention and triggered market anxiety. But for active managers, looking at the latest macroeconomic indicators isn&rsquo;t the best way to search for stocks with sustainable growth potential.</p><h3> <strong>  Outpacing the Economy </strong></h3><p> <br/> In fact, many industries are forecast to grow at much faster rates than the US economy in the coming years, no matter what the pace of gross domestic product will be (Display). Searching for companies that can benefit from secular growth trends is  <a href=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/post/en/2016/03/finding-silver-linings-in-cloudy-us-markets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  one of several ways  </a> that active investors can capture excess returns over long time horizons.</p><p> <img src=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/blog/en/uploads/2016/04/Tierney_Secular-Growth_display1.jpg?uuid=e1bf3612-009c-11e6-9021-24a93adda16d\"/></p><p> In the auto industry, demand is steadily rising for cutting-edge safety systems. Revenue from advanced driver-assistance systems is poised to rise rapidly (Display below, left), as the installed base is projected to increase from 3% of vehicles today to 30% in 2020&mdash;including virtually all new cars built after 2018. This trend is being fueled by consumer preferences, regulatory changes and insurance incentives. Growth in the auto industry tends to be cyclical, as sales rise and fall with the ebb and flow of the economy. However, as these systems become standard features on more new car models, we expect their growth to increase at a much steadier pace.</p><p> <img src=\"https://blog.abglobal.com/blog/en/uploads/2016/04/Tierney_Secular-Growth_display2.jpg?uuid=e27d9e2c-009c-11e6-9021-24a93adda16d\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Digital Advertising Powers Ahead </strong></h3><p> <br/> Digital advertising is another area that is powering ahead (Display above, right). Major US consumer companies are continuing to shift spending toward digital advertising because the returns on their investment have eclipsed returns from traditional advertising during the last five years, even as economic growth has been lackluster.</p><p> Big Data is also a great source of secular growth. The amount of data in the world is growing exponentially, thanks to social media, Netflix, YouTube and the Internet of Things. All of that information must be stored, transported, analyzed and protected, which creates tremen&not;dous growth opportunities that are likely to persist through changing economic conditions.</p><h3> <strong>  From Healthcare to Finance </strong></h3><p> <br/> Technology isn&rsquo;t the only catalyst for durable secular growth. Take the healthcare sector, for example. People suffering from an illness don&rsquo;t stop buying medications in an economic downturn. The aging US population is increasing the demand for drugs. And the Affordable Care Act has triggered a seismic shift in patient numbers and spending patterns that isn&rsquo;t going to be dented by the direction or magnitude of economic growth.</p><p> Financial firms are often seen as vulnerable to economic momentum. Yet within the sector, credit card companies are benefiting from a long-term shift from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment. As a result, underlying transactions for some companies have been growing at around 10% for some time&mdash;approximately two to three times faster than underlying consumer spending. In an economic slowdown, that growth might slip a bit, but it should still be robust compared to that of other companies, because the payment-shift trend is continuing.</p><p> In contrast, earnings in the retail and manufacturing sectors are more directly tied to GDP growth and interest-rate trends. And of course, most energy companies are vulnerable to downturns, especially when an oil-price slump is at the heart of the problem. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should avoid all cyclical companies. But attractive equity opportunities in sectors like these should be approached with caution, given the uncertainty surrounding economic growth.</p><p> Seven years into a bull market, with the US economy growing modestly, not all boats will rise at the same pace. In this environment, being selective is essential to identifying stocks that can benefit from growth anomalies&mdash;and rise above formidable challenges&mdash;to deliver long-term returns.</p>The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.",

    "title": "8 Questions to Ask Before Selecting a Marketing Automation Software Provider",
    "link": "8-questions-to-ask-before-selecting-a-marketing-automation-software-provider",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> As of 2016, 49% of companies are using marketing automation software. <br/>  </h3><p> This tells us two things: first, that those companies who do use marketing automation can still count it as a competitive advantage; and second, that confusion over platform offerings and pricing is likely still an impediment to more widespread adoption.</p><p> There are so many  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-marketing-automation-platforms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  marketing automation platforms </a>  right now that choosing a provider can be a real headache. Often, the pricing, features and customer service offerings are structured in such a way that makes it difficult to compare apples-to-apples.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve come up with a list of essential questions to ask providers before making a decision to switch over to a particular system. </p><h3> 1. What integration do you offer? <br/>  </h3><p> Remember your ultimate goal is to consolidate systems to end up with a very clear picture of how well your online prospecting and converting processes are functioning. Ideally, your marketing automation platform will include integration with Salesforce or whatever other CRM platform you&rsquo;re using &mdash; at the very least. Most marketing automation platforms include further integration with SurveyMonkey, Shopify,  <a href=\"http://zpr.io/sf5B\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Zapier </a> , WordPress,  <a href=\"http://www.aweber.com/?342556\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  AWeber </a> , and other marketing tools. We recommend having a checklist of &ldquo;must-have tools&rdquo; you&rsquo;d like integrated to run through with prospective providers.</p><h3> 2. How flexible are the reports? <br/>  </h3><p> A common complaint among marketing automation users is the rigidity in some of the reporting modules. For instance, you may find that you can only track the success of a campaign back a month or two, with no ability to specify custom dates. Ask about customization options for reports and whether you can have them automatically delivered to different users.</p><h3> 3. How does your platform measure the success of campaigns? <br/>  </h3><p> What specific metrics can you track? Can you track opens and clicks of emails? Can you  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/top-8-landing-page-builders-for-marketers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   A/B test landing pages  </a> </u>  and forms? Can you track a prospect through their entire life cycle &mdash; even beyond the sale, to nurture ongoing relationships, as well as generate new leads?</p><h3> 4. What is the true cost? <br/>  </h3><p> Hidden fees and costs of a particular platform may include:</p><li> Mandatory training expenditures</li><li> Additional charges for adding users</li><li> Additional charges for adding contacts to the database</li><li> Additional charges for going beyond a set number of emails</li><li> Additional charges for monthly billing, rather than annual billing</li><li> Charges for adding functionality and features on top of the basic plan</li><li> Charges for additional &ldquo;insights&rdquo; from consultants</li><p> As Knowledge Marketing For Industry points out: Don&rsquo;t forget about all the other intangible &ldquo;expenses&rdquo;: man-hours spent for your staff to learn the new platform and the complexity that may cause these hours to skyrocket, while your talent&rsquo;s time may be better spent on something else.</p><p> <img alt=\"Infusionsoft Pricing\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Infusionsoft-Pricing.jpg\"/></p><h3> 5. What support is included? <br/>  </h3><p> In our experience, generous customer service sets the best marketing automation platforms from the worst. We&rsquo;ve tried some providers that were downright difficult to get ahold of &mdash; and others that act as true partners. You want to ask whether telephone support is available, when it&rsquo;s available, and how much it costs. You will almost always need it for one reason or another at some point. Is there live chat or email options? You don&rsquo;t want to end up in a position where you&rsquo;re paying tons of extra money due to unexpected difficulties learning the new platform you assumed you&rsquo;d never need.</p><h3> 6. Is training included? <br/>  </h3><p> The best vendors offer some type of training, whether it&rsquo;s hands-on support presented to your company members directly or an online tutorial and webinars. Training is an important consideration with regard to pricing that can vary wildly from company to company. For instance,  <a href=\"http://www.8waysin8days.com/infusionsoft\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Infusionsoft </a>  has a mandatory $1,999 kickstart training package that some say is a &ldquo;deal-breaker&rdquo; when shopping around for a new platform. Similarly, HubSpot charges mandatory training fees in the $500 &ndash; $2,000 range. On the other hand, Hatchbuck offers free training with their semi-annual plan and as a Mod Girl Hatchbuck partner, we provide free training on both semi-annual and monthly plans.</p><p> <img alt=\"Marketing automation questions\" src=\"http://4b9cae461ny22p1bzoeb3tg1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thepursuitgroup.jpg\"/></p><h3> 7. Are there limits on the number of contacts in my database? <br/>  </h3><p> Many marketing automation systems charge monthly fees depending on the number of contacts in your database. With HubSpot, you pay $200 for 100 contacts, $800 for 1,000 contacts, or $2,400 for 10,000 contacts. With InfusionSoft, you pay $199 for 2,500 contacts, $299 for 5,000 contacts, or $379 for 10,000 contacts. With Act-On, you pay $600 for 1,000 contacts or $2,000 for 10,000 contacts, all the way up to 1 million contacts for $6,500 and higher.  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.capterra.com/2014-marketing-automation-software-pricing-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Check out this blog from Capterra  </a> </u>  for more detailed information on pricing and the difference between packages.</p><h3> 8. Does the platform support mobile? <br/>  </h3><p> With more than 50% of responses coming from mobile devices, you&rsquo;d think this would be a standard given across the board, but the rise of dedicated mobile marketing automation platforms suggests otherwise. So you want to make sure your vendor provides built-in mobile optimization for landing pages, email templates and forms.</p>",

    "title": "5 Lessons in Business That We Can Learn from Baseball",
    "link": "5-lessons-in-business-that-we-can-learn-from-baseball",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As winter gives way to spring, the MLB season kicks off, and 30 teams begin the year with a chance to win it all.</p><p> As the season gets underway, we are reminded of the undying wisdom of America&rsquo;s pastime, and how it can help guide us in our own small business endeavors.</p><h3> Here are 5 Lessons We Can Learn from Baseball: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. More money does not equal more success <br/>  </h3><p> Gone are the days of buying all the free agents and coasting to a World Series championship, a la the Yankees&rsquo; strategy of the &lsquo;90s. It just doesn&rsquo;t seem to work that way anymore. The Los Angeles Dodgers, for example, have had one of the highest payrolls the last several years, and yet can&rsquo;t seem to even get to the World Series, let alone win it. In contrast, last year&rsquo;s World Series included two teams &ndash; the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets &ndash; with payrolls right around the MLB median.</p><p> In running your business, there is a persistent perception that a business could do better only if it had more capital and spent more money. False. Rather, excellence, efficiency, flexibility, innovation, and creativity are much more important. As a simple example, I just read an average chicken today is about six pounds versus three pounds in 1950. However, it takes about one week to grow a chicken one pound compared to three weeks in 1950. Thus it takes half the time to grow twice as big a chicken than in 1950.</p><h3> 2.  Look for market inefficiencies <br/>  </h3><p> The concept of Moneyball is to find things that everyone else undervalues and invest in those things, so your dollars go further than your competitor&rsquo;s. During the era in which Billy Beane first implemented these ideas, on-base percentage was undervalued. Nowadays, advanced statistics are showing that perhaps defense is undervalued. The market changes. Look for what&rsquo;s undervalued. Look for opportunities that your competitors aren&rsquo;t paying attention to.</p><p> Sharing sites like Airbnb, Amazon, and Uber are revolutionizing markets. They are simply taking expensive and more complicated efforts out of the system.</p><h3> 3. Develop a &ldquo;good eye&rdquo; <br/>  </h3><p> A batter with a good eye doesn&rsquo;t swing at pitches out of the strike zone. He waits for a pitch that&rsquo;s in his wheelhouse before attacking. As a result, he makes better contact more consistently.</p><p> Business is the same. There are opportunities everywhere, but if you chase every single one, you&rsquo;re bound to get out of whack and whiff. Using analytical tools to take advantage of opportunities and avoid challenges can be highly productive. For example, increasing internet sales, rather than striking out with stagnant brick and mortar customers, has helped many of our clients.</p><h3> 4. Batting order isn&rsquo;t overwhelmingly important <br/>  </h3><p> One of the benefits of money ball is that it brought more advanced statistics into the game. One surprising discovery was that the batting order of a team&rsquo;s lineup doesn&rsquo;t have a huge impact on how many runs they are projected to score. Considering how hard people agonize over whose hitting leadoff, whether so-and-so is a number-three hitter or a cleanup hitter, and so forth, this is surprising. And yet math shows it to be true. The lesson?</p><p> Stop stressing out so much about which idea you pursue next. At the end of the day, as long as you have a bunch of good ideas, then the order in which you pursue them won&rsquo;t make a big impact one way or another on your success. Take a moment to strategize and then get out there and start taking action. We agonize so long over many decisions that they never get tried instead of testing a variety of alternatives</p><h3> 5.  There&rsquo;s always another day <br/>  </h3><p> Perhaps one of the most important lessons of all in the 162-game season is that tomorrow is always an opportunity to redeem yourself. It&rsquo;s a long season, and if players agonized over past failures, they wouldn&rsquo;t even make it to the All-Star break without having a nervous breakdown. Besides, the more at-bats, the more the chance for hits.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Here&rsquo;s the scenario: You&rsquo;ve got an article to write on an interesting topic. You have more than enough time to meet your deadline and an editor lined up to perfect your words. There&rsquo;s one big problem, though. The words won&rsquo;t come. You&rsquo;ve got writer&rsquo;s block.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve been staring at a blank page for days. And your deadline, which seemed generous at first, is starting to close in on you. Every writer has been there. What can you do about it? </p><p> One idea is to put your article aside until the eleventh hour. There&rsquo;s nothing like the adrenaline of an immediate deadline to make you put pen to paper &ndash; or hand to keyboard. We know from experience that this trick often works, but it also leads to plenty of stress. What it likely doesn&rsquo;t lead to is your best work.</p><h3> Try one of these tips, which we think you&rsquo;ll find more productive: <br/>  </h3><h3> Do something fun <br/>  </h3><p> Writers are often told that they should write early in the morning. Science says that&rsquo;s when writers are most creative and least likely to be distracted by all the other things they have to do that day.</p><p> But when you&rsquo;re completely stuck on an article, going straight into writing mode first thing in the morning might not work. What&rsquo;s more, it might derail your day as you spend hour after hour trying to figure out what you want to say.</p><p> Why not start your day with a project you&rsquo;re excited about? It&rsquo;ll be more fun, make you feel productive and put you in the right mindset.</p><h3> Take it one step at a time <br/>  </h3><p> At this point, you just want to get this article done. You&rsquo;ll be tempted to start at the beginning and work your way through until you&rsquo;re finally &ndash; finally! &ndash; done.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re dealing with writer&rsquo;s block, though, we find the best approach is to break your task up into chunks.</p><p> <strong>  Step 1: Get organized </strong></p><p> Start with something small, like creating a new folder (physical or virtual) where you&rsquo;ll keep all your research and drafts. With this one little step, you&rsquo;ve accomplished something and you&rsquo;re one step closer to meeting that deadline.</p><p> <strong>  Step 2: Research </strong></p><p> Do some reading. Find out what other people have to say on the topic you&rsquo;re writing about. Make a bullet point list of any ideas you find interesting, and add your own thoughts to those bullet points.</p><p> <strong>  Step 3: Create an outline </strong></p><p> Use your bullet points to create a rough outline. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be great at this stage, because you&rsquo;re going to do a bit more research and continue putting more and more ideas under each of those bullet points. Move those bullets around until you have groups of ideas that fit nicely together. Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll have a solid outline.</p><p> <strong>  Step 4: Write </strong></p><p> With a solid outline, getting started on the task of writing will suddenly seem much easier. All you need to do is turn those bullet points into sentences and paragraphs, and you&rsquo;ll have a first draft. The draft may still need some polishing, but you&rsquo;re most of the way there now!</p><h3> Procrastinate productively <br/>  </h3><p> Remember that writing is more than putting words on paper. It&rsquo;s also about thinking through your ideas and deciding what you want to say and how you want to say it. You should feel free to walk away from what you&rsquo;re writing when you need to for some quality &ldquo;thinking time.&rdquo;</p><p> And if you use these breaks to do something productive, you won&rsquo;t think of it as time wasted. Here&rsquo;s an idea: offer to go on a coffee run for your colleagues. You&rsquo;ll get fresh air and exercise &ndash; which are both known to be good for creativity &ndash; and your colleagues will thank you.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> I can&rsquo;t believe he asked me who I was going to vote for. We have a private ballot box for a reason! <br/>  </h3><p> It can be tempting to ask provocative, challenging or personal questions. What&rsquo;s the harm in finding out who your colleagues think should win the election, or asking their opinions about the death penalty? </p><p> Don&rsquo;t do it. I know that asking questions is one of the ways to engage with people. Yet, if you ask certain types of questions, you could embarrass people or get an answer you didn&rsquo;t expect, or want. The examples that follows can quickly escalate into an argument, and easily become heated.  </p><p> Avoid asking the following types of questions: </p><p> <strong>  1. Questions involving money. These include anything along these lines: </strong></p><li> &ldquo;How can you afford that handbag (or those fancy shoes)?&rdquo; </li><li> &ldquo;How much money do you make?&rdquo; </li><li> &ldquo;What did you pay for your house?&rdquo; </li><p> The answers to questions like these are not your business, and by asking them, you are likely to make the other person uncomfortable.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  2. Political questions </strong></p><p> These include, &ldquo;For whom are you going to vote?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How can you vote for...?&rdquo;  Your opinion of the person you&rsquo;re questioning can be altered, often negatively, if he or she is not voting for your candidate. And the other person&rsquo;s opinion of you may change, too.</p><p> <strong>  3. Questions on controversial topics </strong></p><p> These are similar to political questions. If you ask someone about his or her opinion on the death penalty, animal rights, abortion, etc., you may get an answer you weren&rsquo;t expecting. You could subsequently get into an unpleasant exchange, as these are the kinds of topics on which people try to change other&rsquo;s beliefs.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  4. Very personal questions </strong></p><p> These include, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your sexual orientation?&rdquo; &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you pregnant?&rdquo; (Avoid this one at all costs!)  &ldquo;Are you having an affair with_____?&rdquo; If your colleague wanted you to know the answers to these questions, he or she would have told you.  <br/> <br/> <strong>  5. Negative questions </strong></p><p> These include such questions as: &ldquo;How can you stand working with _____?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the boss&rsquo;s position on ______ is outrageous?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Why did you cut your hair/shave your beard? I liked it better the other way.&rdquo; These questions are really judgment statements, and can become fighting words.   </p>",

    "content": "<h3> At the end of a job interview, you should expect to be asked if you have any questions for the interviewer or hiring manager. <br/>  </h3><p> This can be a tricky moment, so you need to be sure about how you are going to respond. </p><p> If you say that you have no questions to ask, don't think that it means you are well-informed. As a matter of fact, hiring managers and interviewers are not impressed by job candidates who do not ask questions during the interview. By asking sensible questions, you will be able to learn more about the culture of the company, and this can also convince potential employers that you are right for the job.</p><h3> The following are among the more important questions you should ask during a job interview: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. What does it mean to be successful at this position? <br/>  </h3><p> Asking this question means that you are passionate about your job and you intend to be successful. The answer to this question will also give you an idea about what you should do to advance in your career in case you get the job.</p><h3> 2. What skills and experiences does an ideal candidate possess? <br/>  </h3><p> When you ask an interviewer this question, he or she will have no other choice but to tell you and explain to you what it is exactly they are looking for. It's also possible that the interviewer will mention a qualification or a skill that hasn't been discussed before. In this case, you should grab this chance to remind him or her why you are the right person for the position.</p><h3> 3. Do you offer education and training options? <br/>  </h3><p> By asking this questions, you are expressing your willingness to learn and your drive towards becoming better, which is what companies are looking for in the right candidate. Employers appreciate those people who have the desire to expand their knowledge and grow with the company.</p><h3> 4. Is this a new position or was it filled previously? <br/>  </h3><p> When you ask this question, you can get an idea about how the company works. If the position was held before, the story of that employee will help you get a better understanding of whether or not career advancement is one of the perks of this position.</p><h3> 5. What is the next step in the process of recruitment? <br/>  </h3><p> This is a excellent question before you wrap up the interview. Asking this question would show that you are pretty much aware of the recruitment process. This could also show that you are enthusiastic about the position.</p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> Career coaching specialists believe that job interviews are designed to put job candidates on the spot. Employers want to see how applicants can handle stressful situations. But you shouldn't be intimidated by all their questioning, and instead, you should be active in asking questions as well so you could leave a good impression to the potential employer.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> \"There is someone on my team who hasn&rsquo;t been performing well for a while now. I&rsquo;m almost embarrassed to say he&rsquo;s been on my radar for more than a year. I keep finding reasons not to make the hard decision and let him go, only to have it come back and bite me each time. I&rsquo;m starting to worry about how this is impacting my team and what it says about my strength as a manager. How do you know when it&rsquo;s finally time to fire someone?\" - Employer.</p><p> I can&rsquo;t think of a worse part about being a manager than having to let people go. Anyone who tells you they don&rsquo;t mind firing people is either lying or sadistic. It&rsquo;s awful.</p><p> Even after all these years, I still lose sleep over each person I have to let go. Whether a person is incompetent or not, a bad cultural fit, mean spirited, redundant &hellip; whatever &hellip; when you fire someone you&rsquo;re causing them a great deal of pain and directly impacting their lives and the lives of their families. I take this extremely seriously and so should you. </p><h3> The scenario you&rsquo;re describing rings true to me <br/>  </h3><p> The fact that you&rsquo;re struggling with it only means you&rsquo;re human. I&rsquo;ve done the same thing many times. I&rsquo;m always searching for reasons not to let someone go. I find myself looking for any hint or sign of hope I can use to justify hanging on a little longer. I find myself spending weeks pondering the decision, weighing the pros and cons, trying to justify not doing it. </p><li> Maybe I haven&rsquo;t given her enough coaching.</li><li> Maybe I haven&rsquo;t provided him clarity of his role and objectives.</li><li> Maybe with some extra help she can get better?</li><li> How people look at me for hiring the person only to now be letting them go?</li><li> What impact will this have on the morale of the team?</li><p> These are all legitimate questions, and they take over my mind for the days and weeks leading up to the decision point. And then, when I&rsquo;ve finally made the hard choice, I worry about it &hellip; a lot. I always have trouble sleeping the night before and I&rsquo;m distracted all day before it finally happens. But the sad truth is, when I look back on most of these situations, I can say with confidence I waited too long to act. I suspect you know in your heart that the same is true for you. But the real question is, &ldquo;how do you know for sure when it&rsquo;s finally time to fire someone?&rdquo;</p><h3> Here are 3 signs that ultimately tell me when it&rsquo;s time to stop trying to fix things and finally make the decision to let someone go <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Team morale is hurt more by them staying than going.  </strong></p><p> This is a line of thinking I don&rsquo;t think enough managers consider. We talk a lot about the negative impact firing someone can have on a team but we rarely discuss the negative impact of indefinitely carrying incompetent or disruptive employees. There comes a point when letting a person go can actually have a net positive impact on team morale. </p><p> There is very little more frustrating than having your own success consistently hampered by another person&rsquo;s incompetence. If 90 percent of your team are working hard, producing great work and collaborating effectively, what message are you sending by supporting the 10 percent who are doing the opposite? If you&rsquo;re not careful, you can create a situation where the culture you&rsquo;re building actually drives good people away while building a safe haven for negative contributors. I talk in my  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Corner-Office-Strategies-Business/dp/1601633203/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384192499&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=9781601633200\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  book  </a> about a period where I worked for a company where this happened &ndash; the incompetents actually started to outnumber the competents - the inmates took over the asylum.</p><p> My advice to managers is to ask yourself this question whenever you&rsquo;re thinking about whether or not it&rsquo;s time to let someone go: &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m honest with myself, is it possible team morale would actually go up if I let this person go?&rdquo; If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s time to make the hard decision.</p><p> <strong>  2. I can&rsquo;t honestly imagine them being great one day </strong></p><p> As a manager your job is to create an environment and put people on a path to being great at what they do. That&rsquo;s what building a great team is &ndash; each member getting better every day until they&rsquo;re masters at their craft. When you have a team full of masters, you&rsquo;ll be great. With that perspective in mind, one of the key signs it&rsquo;s time to let someone go is when you can&rsquo;t honestly envision a person being great at their role or any other available role on the team. If there is no realistic path to greatness &ndash; no matter how long or challenging it may have to be &ndash; then its time. I find myself spending a lot of time on this train of thought lately. I structure all my team 1 on 1s to focus on the path to greatness. And when I start feeling cynical about it or I stop believing what I&rsquo;m discussing with the person, an alarm goes off in my head and I know I need to make a change. </p><p> My advice to managers is to get more active in building and measuring each employee&rsquo;s path to greatness at whatever function they perform for the company. When you create this mindset for you and your team, it will help you know when it&rsquo;s time to let someone go. Keep asking yourself, &ldquo;Can I honestly imagine a scenario where this person can be truly great in their role or any role on my team?&rdquo; If the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; it&rsquo;s time to move on.</p><p> <strong>  3. They&rsquo;ve shown a pattern of bad judgement or questionable morals </strong></p><p> This is a pretty easy one for me. If I can&rsquo;t trust a person, I can&rsquo;t have them on my team. You&rsquo;d be surprised how many managers actually don&rsquo;t feel this way or at least seem willing to carry people who show bad judgment or dicey ethics just because they are smart or high performers. The fastest path to a toxic team is to support people you can&rsquo;t trust. When I say &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in this context I&rsquo;m referring both to a person&rsquo;s morale decision making and logical decision making. If you&rsquo;ve got someone on your team who is demonstrating dicey moral judgement &ndash; that&rsquo;s a no brainer. But it&rsquo;s also pretty clear cut when you&rsquo;ve got a well-intentioned person who consistently makes business decisions that seem unjustifiable by logic or common sense. If I can&rsquo;t trust a person to make basic, sound decisions, there is just no starting point to build from.</p><p> My advice to managers is to analyze decision making as critically as you analyze outcomes. Sometimes we use positive outcomes as a justification for questionable logic or morals. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Does this person follow a consistent, logical and ethical path for making decisions?&rdquo; If the answer is no, it&rsquo;s time to let them go. In my experience this is no recovery from this.</p><p> Letting people go is terrible. It&rsquo;s probably the worst thing we have to do as managers. It can have devastating impact on people&rsquo;s lives so you need to take it extremely seriously. But in my experience, more often than not, we allow our emotional revulsion to the idea prolong what needs to be done. I use these three signs to keep me thinking about it this difficult decision the right way. I hope they will help you to.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Quality of life. It&rsquo;s something people at every age talk about, and some go to great pains to make it happen. <br/>  </h3><p> But how do you actually define &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo;?</p><p> For one person, it may mean working less, downsizing as much as possible, and spending more time with family and friends. For another, it may mean working more (hopefully at a fulfilling job) to fund more travel or afford other luxuries.</p><p> Regardless of your choices, money often plays a role, both before and during retirement. That&rsquo;s why creating a personal financial plan to support your goals&mdash;whatever they may be&mdash;is essential. But that&rsquo;s not always as easy as it sounds.</p><p> John and Judy are in the &ldquo;catbird seat of life.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re 68 years old, still working, healthy, and mobile. They&rsquo;re in the peak of their earning years with no plans to retire any time soon. Unlike a lot of Baby Boomers, they&rsquo;ve done a great job saving for retirement, and their investment assets recently topped $1.5 million. But achieving a high quality of life hasn&rsquo;t been that easy&mdash;at least for John. His father worked as a doctor until he was in his late 70s, so John feels pressure to keep working another decade to &ldquo;add to our nest egg.&rdquo; And while he loves his job, finding balance between work and play has been an ongoing challenge for him. Yes, he plays golf now and then, and he and Judy finally took a long-awaited trip to Europe last year. But his time away from the office is rare. When he does take time to relax, his outgoing personality shines. His favorite leisure activity is dining with friends&mdash;often in friends&rsquo; homes.</p><p> The last time John and I sat down to chat, I asked him what he&rsquo;d like to do this year to enjoy life more. He was quick to answer: &ldquo;I want to update our house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done any major improvements in 20 years. I love to cook, but the kitchen is outdated, and the bathrooms and floors all need updating. I&rsquo;ve priced it out, and we&rsquo;re looking at $75,000 to $100,000 to do it all. But where should the money for that come from?&rdquo;</p><p> At 68, I knew the last thing they should consider is leveraging their HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit). They still owe $350K on their house, and even though the interest rate is just 3.25%, their monthly payment with property taxes and insurance is $2,400 a month. As we brainstormed options, John mentioned a $100K savings account that&rsquo;s sitting in the bank earning almost 0% interest. It seemed like the perfect solution. But there was a glitch: &ldquo;Judy doesn&rsquo;t want to touch it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She calls it her &lsquo;comfort money,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s the one piece of our savings that&rsquo;s always been off limits.&rdquo;  </p><p> As their financial advisor, I&rsquo;m well aware that John and Judy have more than enough in investment assets to fund their retirement&mdash;especially since John wants to continue to work indefinitely. Plus, they can take $100K from their investments any time they need it and receive the funds in two business days, so Judy&rsquo;s &ldquo;comfort money&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t financially necessary (especially at 0% interest). But because Judy views it as money they might need for medical care, assisted living, and other late-in-life expenses, it feels emotionally necessary to her.</p><p> Last week, I met with John and Judy together to see if we could find a solution that they both could agree on. As we talked, the challenge became clear: John and Judy share a financial life, but they define &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; very differently. John values entertaining friends at their home, but he&rsquo;s embarrassed because the house is so outdated and uncomfortable for guests (and for him) without the renovation. Judy, on the other hand, is an introvert. &ldquo;I need a financial security blanket,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather make do with the house as it is than spend money we might need when we can&rsquo;t work any longer.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s not an easy situation, but I&rsquo;m so glad we had the conversation. John shared about his desire to have the beautiful home he&rsquo;s proud of and can entertain in, but he said he didn&rsquo;t want to threaten Judy&rsquo;s need for security. She understood how much it meant to him, but the fear of touching her &ldquo;comfort money&rdquo; made her feel paralyzed.</p><p> To assuage Judy&rsquo;s fears, I showed her exactly what assets they had saved and how much John was continuing to contribute while he worked. Then we compared their savings to estimated expenses, even in a worst-case scenario. Next, we talked through her financial fears. When she learned that money from their investment account could be in their checking account in two days with no penalty&mdash;and that the invested money would grow over the next decade to provide more assets in the future&mdash;her fears began to melt. John offered to keep the budget to $75K so Judy would still have $25K as an additional security blanket. When I added that much of the work on the house would need to be done anyway if they decided to sell in the future, she decided using the savings was the right choice. Perhaps even more importantly, Judy said that having people in their home increased her quality of life as well. Mission accomplished.</p><p> Quality of life is important, no matter what your level of assets or what your age. The key is identifying what will really make you happy, and then putting a plan in place to work toward those goals&mdash;financially, physically, and emotionally. That &ldquo;three-legged stool&rdquo; becomes more important as we age, so the more you can do to control the things you cancontrol today, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to achieve your own quality of life, however you choose to define it.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: Alan Bernstein</p><p> Any major life transition requires preparation. We are clear that we need financial resources. And that mental and emotional preparation is required.</p><p> Somewhat less clear is the need for physical stamina&ndash; the capacity to maintain endurance in the face of doubt and anxiety, hope and promise. We are organizing our letter for those of us who started as athletes and are now remaking ourselves as &ldquo;conditioners&rdquo;&ndash; people who wish to morph their athletic gifts in the current service of transition. They face particular challenges.</p><p> Most athletes are born competitors. Since our early years, we have been conditioned to think in terms of &ldquo;how many,&rdquo; &ldquo;how much&rdquo; and &ldquo;how fast.&rdquo; The cruel twist of fate parallels the wisdom of age with the slowing of the fast-twitch muscles. The athlete who wishes to retain enjoyment in his older years needs cunning as well as brawn to do well, feel well, and be well!</p><p> Our primal instincts regarding the ever-upward ascent of our achievements have to withstand the changes in absolute measure (hardly any of us will be faster at sixty than we were at twenty, or even forty). We have to learn to take pride in finesse, in working with our changing bodies in a cooperative dance rather than a wrestling match, and to do so with the fond eye of a lover rather than the stopwatch of our high school coach.</p><p> How can we find the psychological energy to alter the deep-seated paradigm of measurement by numbers to a more profound acceptance and support for our now-aging bodies? How can we convert trial by numbers into admiration for coordination, reverence for grace and respect for complexity? Not an easy task, to be sure.</p><p> As in so many areas of life, a good starting point is self analysis. What brings me joy in my physical life? When do I thrive and which conditions make it possible?</p><p> A historical analysis can be useful. Write a series of memories, no more than 250 words, and let yourself recall when in your life you have felt best about your athletic achievements. Were you alone, as in weight-lifting for example, where the solitary meditation brought you into competition with yourself? Or do you fondly remember team sports where the pleasure of a shared win was greater than anyone&rsquo;s individual achievement? Did you enjoy pageantry, such as the baseball stadium, with uniforms and marked-out running lanes, or did you prefer the isolation and simplicity of cross-country running? Your goal is to understand the preconditions that set you up for success so that these can be redeveloped in other venues.</p><p> For example, I loved long distance running. In high school I ran cross-country. Even in track, I preferred the longest distances. As an adult I gradually morphed into a marathon runner until knee surgeries and lower back pains suggested that this was no longer the best sport for me. As I analyzed my love of running, I found that I enjoyed working out with my teammates as well as their companionship on the subway ride to the park in the Bronx, more than an hour from our school in Brooklyn. I enjoyed the planning for the race almost as much as the race!</p><p> I began to see that I enjoyed sports where a theoretical understanding was as important as the actual performance. Gradually, after trying various classes at my gym, I found that yoga gave me many of the same values I associated with running. I read about the mind set which made holding postures possible and it was remarkably similar to the strategies for long distance running! The only difference was that my body thrived in this new regime. There were no more swollen knees, no Ibuprofen or ice packs. I just showed up, took classes with my fellow students, many in their twenties, and felt terrific afterward.</p><p> Like others who have found joy in adapting their sports to their bodies, I had come to a new sport partly by serendipity (I had a tried a few other classes) and partly by having a prepared mind. I knew the feelings I wanted, I just didn&rsquo;t know which sports would create those feelings.</p><p> Similarly, a friend of mine was a B level squash player (&ldquo;A&rdquo; level is professional). She couldn&rsquo;t move as quickly as she used to, nor as dexterously, having injured her shoulder cartilage. She analyzed other sports with a range of motion similar to her squash stroke, but with more limited shoulder movement, and decided to try archery. Six years later she competes at national level tournaments. She found that she loves the discipline of archery and the range of motion was perfectly suited to her current shoulder conditioning. In addition, having watched herself through tournaments over many years, she wasn&rsquo;t prepared to give up the rankings and associated measures of success which give her a sense of accomplishment.</p><p> By analyzing the parts of experience which defined our pleasure, we were both able to find sports which defined areas of strength and competence in our current bodies. We each still feel like athletes, but in a style which responds to our current capacities. The advantage we gained from the mental analysis was a resource in finding a physical form. As in so many areas of life, luck favors the prepared mind.</p><p> We are aware that not all our readers are necessarily ex-athletes, but physical stamina is demanded from all individuals preparing for major transition.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Have you noticed that every day or week is dedicated to something? <br/>  </h3><p> It was Siblings Day last weekend. There's National Doughnut Day (a fundraiser for the Salvation Army), National Hot Sauce Day (January 22), and recently it was Scrabble Day. Among all the frivolity, there are some worthwhile campaigns, including National Retirement Planning Week.</p><p> The attention on retirement planning begs this question: Does retirement planning need an \"awareness week\"? Absolutely! </p><p> While no one needs to be made more aware of doughnuts, anything that gets people to pay attention to something that will help them live a better life is worthwhile. As a survivor myself, I hope Breast Cancer Awareness Month pushes women to get that mammogram they&rsquo;ve been putting off. As a financial advisor, I hope Retirement Planning Week pushes you to take a serious look at where you are today&mdash;and where you need to be when it comes to funding your future income. At the same time, I&rsquo;d like to make a unique push for redefining retirement planning as most people think of it today.</p><p> When I first met Katherine 10 years ago, she was enjoying a fantastic career at a large, global company. She was traveling the world, entertaining, and a living a high-end, high-cost lifestyle that included a sizable mortgage. She came to me to start planning for retirement. The challenge: she was already in her mid-50s. And while she was earning a bundle, she had almost nothing stashed away to support her once those big paychecks stopped coming in. The first time we met, I suggested we rethink her approach; rather than &ldquo;saving for retirement&rdquo;, I recommended she start building a &ldquo;freedom fund&rdquo; for the future. Katherine loved the idea. She looked at it like a credit card payment that had to be paid in full each month, and she was religious about her contributions.</p><p> Five years later, calamity struck. The company she&rsquo;d been with for the bulk of her career went bankrupt and laid off 80% of its employees, including Katherine. At the same time, she was hit with a frivolous lawsuit and had to spend thousands of dollars to defend herself in court. Luckily, her freedom fund was at the ready. She was able to pay herself each month while she figured out her next career move, and she paid her legal fees without having to take on any debt. Within 12 months, she had reestablished her career&mdash;this time as an independent consultant&mdash;and was once again growing her freedom fund. She&rsquo;s not looking to retire any time soon, but she&rsquo;s paying off that debt to herself now so she can focus on enjoying life when the time comes.</p><p> At 65, Katherine is redefining &ldquo;retirement.&rdquo; Like many her age, she&rsquo;s continuing to earn, but she stopped looking for a &ldquo;job&rdquo; the day she walked out the door of her last one. Katherine is part of the growing gig economy. While much of the coverage about this new way of working focuses on millennials, many pre- and post-retirees have jumped on the lucrative bandwagon of taking on a portfolio of work to bolster their income, and possibly delay retirement completely. For many, the Great Recession brought an unplanned early end to their careers, and they found themselves overqualified and, frankly, over the hill when looking for a new job. Like &lsquo;Cassie&rsquo; in the classic musical A Chorus Line, they found they couldn&rsquo;t take a step back from being a star to being just another player&mdash;no matter how much they wanted to be. They took a new approach to working and turned the job economy on its head. From consulting gigs to driving for Uber to freelancing, older workers are finding new ways to make ends meet and completely rethink how they view life after 65.</p><p> When it comes to retirement planning, there are two sides of the equation: what you spend, and what you have coming in. To have resources you&rsquo;ll need, start your freedom fund today. Or take a fresh look at how you&rsquo;re funding the plan you already have. If continuing to work after 65 is appealing, consider joining your peers in the growing gig economy. It can be a great way to stay mentally and physically active while keeping some income rolling in the door.</p><p> However you define retirement, realize that it&rsquo;s a complex balancing act&mdash;emotionally, physically, and financially&mdash;that you should start thinking about long before you receive that gold watch. To make the most of it, view your retirement income as a debt you owe yourself, and pay it in full every month. By the time you do decide to stop working once and for all, you&rsquo;ll be truly debt free, and the last thing you&rsquo;ll need to worry about is retirement income. How&rsquo;s that for retirement planning awareness?</p>",

    "content": "The title of this article isn&rsquo;t meant to imply you are in denial about the importance of customer experience elevation.Rather, I am using FACE as an acronymn for four guiding principles to consider as you craft customer-centric solutions.For me FACE stands for:<strong> Fast</strong><strong> Accurate</strong><strong> Caring</strong><strong> Easy</strong>I can demonstrate two of the four principles (Fast and Easy) with one quick example &ndash; the Domino&rsquo;s Zero Click Pizza app.While many of us may not have thought that ordering pizza was a particuarly time consuming task, Domino&rsquo;s sought to make the relatively easy even easier.In the spirit of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;easy&rdquo; here is how the Zero Click app works.Since most people buy the same food items repeatedly, Domino&rsquo;s will enable a customer to open an app that populates their saved &ldquo;easy order.&rdquo; Upon opening, a 10 second clock will count down and voila the order is placed.In an interview for Ad Age Alex Guerri, the Vice President and account director of Domino&rsquo;s creative agency, CP&amp;B noted, &ldquo;While it does seem like one click is trivial, we thought, &lsquo;Why do we even need that one click?&rsquo;&rdquo;Obviously, customers can stop the clock on the app or change their order if they need to but otherwise they have entered the land of &ldquo;zero click&rdquo; online ordering.With such an emphasis on fast and easy customer experiences, it is increasingly important to focus on the accuracy that goes with that speed. For most customers, fast and wrong is not necessarily better than slow and right! In many service delivery systems, inherent tension exists between speed and accuracy and the feedback from your customers should guide the appropriate balance.Finally, given that technology plays such an important role in driving accuracy and speed, great service organizations must humanize customer experience by hiring and developing compassionate and caring service professionals.Let&rsquo;s assume the Zero Click app allows for fast and easy ordering and accurate product delivery. Domino&rsquo;s had best assure that they have caring people available to help when the app freezes or when a pizza gets ordered faster than a customer could have stopped it from processing.So how is the FACE of your customer-experience?Is it fast enough, accurate enough, caring enough, and easy enough?I used to say that if you aren&rsquo;t delivering adequately your customers were just a &ldquo;click&rdquo; away from the competition. Thanks to Domino&rsquo;s they might not even need to click&hellip;<a href=\"https://www.josephmichelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Face-it.jpeg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Face it\" height=\"2342\" src=\"https://www.josephmichelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Face-it.jpeg \" width=\"560\"/></a>",

    "content": "<h3> So you have a strong brand. Congratulations. <br/>  </h3><p> You walk into a prospective client&rsquo;s office feeling confident and self-assured. You bask in the trust and respect that a good brand confers.</p><p> But wait&mdash;this particular meeting may not be the bowl of cherries you expected. In fact, the executive you&rsquo;re talking to may have a pre-conceived notion of who you are and what you do. A perception that could, unfortunately, be outdated or just plain wrong. Suddenly, you&rsquo;re swimming upstream.</p><p> &ldquo;I thought you were a bargain-rate outsourcing company that helped companies cut costs. You&rsquo;re now a what? A strategic solutions shop focused on revenue growth? Huh. Really?&rdquo;</p><p> <a href=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Man-on-Diving-Board.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Man on Diving Board\" src=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Man-on-Diving-Board-952x1024.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> Even if your prospect&rsquo;s perception is not off kilter, he or she will certainly have very high expectations of you. As a well-known brand, your every statement&mdash;your every step&mdash;will be scrutinized. If you don&rsquo;t live up to your brand promise, the result will quickly be a smoking ruin. Believe me, it happens all the time.</p><p> These are some of the dilemmas of Brand Value versus Specific Value. If you can learn the ins and outs of these two fundamental drivers of client success, you&rsquo;ll leave your competitors behind.</p><p> To explain these, let me share some leading-edge research with you on how we form impressions about other peoples&rsquo; value as potential romantic partners. These new studies about how we choose mates have some important lessons for client development:</p><p> Imagine that you&rsquo;re single and have just arrived at graduate school. You walk into an introductory social event and begin sizing up your classmates. The first things you assess are attractiveness, charisma, and success&mdash;in aggregate, something researchers call Mate Value. You make these judgments in minutes if not seconds.</p><p> Apparently, these evaluations are very similar&mdash;that is, there is a high consensus within a given group about each person&rsquo;s Mate Value.</p><p> But then, something very interesting happens: As people get to know each other over time, the consensus on mate value falls apart. What takes its place is called Unique Value. If you are viewed as having low Mate Value, once someone spends time with you and gets to know you, you may be seen has having very high Unique Value (and vice-versa). The two of you may discover you share a love of literature, or sailing, and start to hit it off despite an initial lack of interest.</p><p> In short, first impressions can give way to a more nuanced assessment that is specific to each person. But you need tointeract with the individual over a period of time. These findings were reported in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology by researchers Paul W. Eastwick and Lucy L. Hunt, and summarized in this  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/opinion/sunday/so-youre-not-desirable.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%5B%22RI%3A10%22%2C%22RI%3A14%22%5D&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DSunday%20Book%20Review%26region%3DTopBar%26WT.nav%3DsearchWidget%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26pgtype%3Darticle%23%2FMate+value\" target=\"_blank\">  New York Times article </a> .</p><p> What does this have to do with client relationships? A lot.</p><p> When you first meet a prospect, before you even walk in the room you are sized up immediately on one important thing: Your perceived brand. Then, as you carry on a conversation with the executive over several meetings, they begin to perceive the distinct, specific value you can add irrespective of your brand. As mentioned earlier, I call these two factors Brand Value andSpecific Value.</p><h3> Let&rsquo;s take a deeper look at how to use these effectively to win and keep clients. <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. The dynamics of Brand Value and Specific Value <br/>  </h3><p> Brand value is the perceived strength, relevance, and accessibility of your brand to the client prospect. Brands reduce institutional and personal risk for the buyer. Brand Value includes the client&rsquo;s perception of:</p><li> Where you are in the &ldquo;pecking order&rdquo; of competitors (e.g., are you the market leader? A market leader? A second-tier company? Etc.)</li><li> The range of products and services you offer</li><li> Your expected quality and fee levels</li><p> Specific value can be defined as the client&rsquo;s perception that you helped them better understand their problem, provided insight during your conversations, and have a solution that is what they need. It refers to the tailored value you add over time based on building a deep understanding of the client and their business. Specific value also encompasses the personal rapport and understanding you build with the client.</p><p> In the graphic, below, I&rsquo;ve set out four permutations of Brand and Specific Value, based on whether or not they are high or low.</p><p> <a href=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Value-Diagram.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Value Diagram\" src=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Value-Diagram.png\"/> </a></p><p> <strong>  Quadrant One: Anger (lower left). </strong> Neither you nor your firm has a well-known brand, and you fail to add any value either during the sales process or during delivery&ndash;if you get that opportunity. The client&rsquo;s reaction? Anger and frustration. You&rsquo;ll never, ever get another chance.</p><p> <strong>  Quadrant Two: Disappointment (upper left). </strong> The client opens their door to a well-known company with a strong brand. But the firm doesn&rsquo;t add specific value&mdash;they don&rsquo;t deliver. The result? Not just disappointment but also a feeling of having been taken advantage of. Ripped off.</p><p> <strong>  Quadrant Three: Reaffirmation (upper right). </strong> If you have a great brand and you add a high amount of specific value, the client is not just pleased&mdash;they will feel justified in having &ldquo;brought in the best.&rdquo; Your brand and your work are affirmed as being outstanding. Everyone feels good.</p><p> <strong>  Quadrant Four: Delight (lower right). </strong> This is when a company or individual with no brand adds great specific value during the sales process and then executes flawlessly during delivery. The result? A client who feels like they have found a special gem. It&rsquo;s almost like they have a secret. They are delighted and may feel great loyalty to their &ldquo;undiscovered but special&rdquo; resource.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s the point: Whether you or your firm has a great brand or has none, you have both a large opportunity and a large risk.</p><h3> 2. Steps you can take to build and accelerate the perception of Specific Value in the client development process.Especially if you have an unfamiliar brand, you have to assiduously demonstrate client-specific value. <br/>  </h3><p> If you&rsquo;re going to see a new prospect, try these strategies:</p><li> Carefully prepare for your meeting. Go in knowing as much as you can about the prospect&rsquo;s business, key challenges, and personal profile. (This step alone will set you apart from 50% of your competitors).</li><li> Bring an incisive, thoughtful point of view about the client&rsquo;s business and/or industry.</li><li> Develop 3-4 thoughtful/thought-provoking questions.</li><li> Prepare several engaging examples of how you&rsquo;ve helped other similar clients with similar challenges</li><li> Mention several best practices that other clients have successfully used.</li><li> Challenge the client&rsquo;s problem definition.</li><li> Ask about the strategic context for the discussion. Why are they interested in program x or product y?</li><li> Dig deeply into the prospect&rsquo;s most important priorities, needs, or goals for the year.</li><p> If you&rsquo;re working with an ongoing client, think about these strategies:</p><li> Invest extra time to really get to know your client&rsquo;s business. Visit their offices and operations.</li><li> Get to know your client as a person. Until you do, you&rsquo;ll be perceived as a competent vendor, not a trusted partner.</li><li> Periodically have a discussion with your client about the value and impact of your work.</li><li> Always be bringing your client small ideas about how to improve their business, no matter what your expertise is or what narrow area you may be working in.</li><p> Here&rsquo;s the good news: By continually adding client-specific value, an unfamiliar brand becomes not just familiar but it is perceived as being bigger and better known than it really is. That is: lots of client-specific value will lead to higher brand value among your client base. And then, you can parlay this into broader, more visible brand leadership through publishing, speaking, and so on.</p><h3> 3. Finally, you have to create more high-value interactions, which are the foundation of Specific Value. <br/>  </h3><p> Remember our graduate students, who formed nearly instant impressions of other&rsquo;s &ldquo;mate value&rdquo;&mdash;their attractiveness, charisma, and success? What demolished these initial impressions was getting to know people better and understanding their particular strengths, interests, and capabilities.</p><p> Here are some suggestions to help ensure you have the chanceto add client-specific value and get the face time to do so:</p><li> Convey Specific Value before you even meet. The most receptive prospect is one who has already perceived value from you in the form of your website, publications you may have sent them, and so on.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t spread yourself too thinly. If you try and cover too many prospects or work with too many clients, you&rsquo;ll never be able to make the investments needed to develop client-specific value.</li><li> Create frequent Interactions. Communicate often with your list of &ldquo;critical few&rdquo; relationships. Stay in touch multiple times a year.</li><li> Embody the new brand you have become. If you want to change the perception of your existing brand, act like you embody the new brand you want to have. If clients perceive you as doing small, transactional projects, start talking about transformational partnerships. Describe an example of client work you&rsquo;ve done that embodies the new brand.</li><li> Get more face time. If you&rsquo;re in a competitive bid, the more face time you can get with the client, the greater your chances of success. Every interaction gives you more opportunity to add client-specific value.</li><p> A great brand is wonderful to have, but you can easily shoot yourself in the foot by resting on your laurels and not working incredibly hard to add Specific Value. And if your Brand Value is low, cheer up: You can start building it up today, one interaction at a time.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Chances are, you know about &ldquo;managing UP.&rdquo; The art of managing the mercurial, distracted, at times temperamental and often unpredictable boss. If you have worked in the corporate world long enough, you have likely taken a class on this essential skill.</p><p> <strong>  Hint:  </strong> Know their priorities. Speak their language. Anticipate their needs. Be truthful and don&rsquo;t BS them. Contract properly at the end of a meeting. Just a few of the essentials.</p><p> Chances are, as well, no one in that class you took spoke about &ldquo;appreciating UP!&rdquo;</p><p> You appreciate the folks on your team. You may forget and you may not do it perfectly, but you know it&rsquo;s a good idea. Chances are, you do little to explicitly appreciate your boss. It&rsquo;s a potent influencing behavior, and yet, the very Senior Execs I coach consistently don&rsquo;t do it. Bosses rarely receive a word of praise or appreciation. Yes, it&rsquo;s lonely at the top, in more ways than one.</p><p> The reason for our lack of explicit boss-appreciation? Chances are, we&rsquo;re clinging tightly to a bunch of subterranean anti-appreciating-UP stories. Here&rsquo;s how these stories go:</p><h3> <strong>  1. I don&rsquo;t want to waste their time. </strong></h3><p> <br/> My boss&rsquo; time is precious. I want to be prepared, get to the point, and show that I respect how busy s/he is.</p><p> Fact: Your boss is a human being with feelings, no matter how efficient their outer demeanor may be. The longing for appreciation is universal.</p><h3> <strong>  2. I don&rsquo;t want to sound like I&rsquo;m sucking UP. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I&rsquo;ve watched other people suck up to Senior Leaders and it just looks and sounds so darn obvious. I don&rsquo;t ever want to become one of THOSE people!</p><p> Fact: Even when it looks like sucking up to you, chances are your boss still appreciates hearing it. Dump the phrase &ldquo;sucking up&rdquo; and supplement it with the phrase &ldquo;expressing genuine appreciation.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about, after all.</p><h3> <strong>  3. My boss is uncomfortable with overly personal chit-chat. </strong></h3><p> <br/> I don&rsquo;t want to cross any personal boundaries with my boss or get into a conversation that becomes too private and which I will later regret.</p><p> <strong>  Fact: </strong>  Praising someone&rsquo;s idea, expertise, or accomplishment is as safe as a professional conversation gets. It&rsquo;s entirely about work. Your story is likely about your discomfort in offering a personal remark to someone with high Position Power, not that person&rsquo;s discomfort in receiving such a remark from you.</p><p> Krista Tippett, the host of NPR&rsquo;s glorious &ldquo;On Being&rdquo; radio program, chats with renowned British poet and organizational advisor David Whyte about leadership wisdom. &ldquo;Being a leader,&rdquo; Whyte affirms, &ldquo;means being visible, all the time. It means truly showing up and not simply going through the motions of showing up.&rdquo;</p><p> Yep. And part of being visible means appreciating UP, discomfort and all. I mean, if you value your boss, why wouldn&rsquo;t you express it?</p>",

    "link": "how-to-manage-non-performance-like-a-champ-not-a-chump",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> I&rsquo;m betting right now there&rsquo;s someone in your team who ain&rsquo;t quite cuttin&rsquo; the mustard.</h3><p> <br/> Managing non-performance is one of the most teeth-gnashing, chair-squirming aspects of leading people. And it&rsquo;s not just new managers who hit Struggle Street when faced with non-performance. Some of the most seasoned, kick ass CEOs I&rsquo;ve coached still get furrowed brows when it comes to tackling the non-performance piece. </p><p> Here are some tips for navigating non-performance like a champ.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s back up the truck a bit first. How crystal clear are they (and you for that matter) on what success in this position actually looks like?</p><p> We generally don&rsquo;t spend enough time up front (when people first start their role) discussing and exploring in enough granular detail, what we will be seeing if they are performing in it. Or we fall into the trap of telling them once and think that this is &ldquo;job done&rdquo;. Or we give them the job description to read and think that&rsquo;s sufficient.</p><p> Spend time upfront making sure you are both on the same page about what success looks like (an unintended benefit of this is that it engenders passion and enthusiasm). Get them to reflect back to you what they are hearing you say.</p><p> Ask: what do they think their priorities should be? What do they see as their strengths? What areas do they feel confident in? What aspects of the role do they feel less confident in, or need development in? Do your descriptions match theirs?</p><p> But let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve done that and they are struggling in some aspect of their role&hellip;</p><h3> <strong>  1. How clear are they that there&rsquo;s actually a problem?  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Being as subtle as a ninja is the bomb if you&rsquo;re in a martial arts movie, but not so useful when you&rsquo;re raising awareness that there&rsquo;s a problem, Houston. The first step in addressing a problem in someone&rsquo;s performance is raising their awareness (directly, compassionately) that there actually is one! Don&rsquo;t soft soap. Don&rsquo;t dance around the mulberry bush.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Don&rsquo;t wait until the issue is as big as Texas before you tackle it.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Too often we delay giving developmental feedback until it&rsquo;s a massive lump under the carpet and we&rsquo;re all tripping over it. Pause long enough to see a pattern, but use intuition, your own levels of frustration and direct observation as a litmus test for when to act and gently raise &lsquo;The Thing&rsquo; as soon as you can stand it.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Make it a conversation, not a lecture. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When your focus and energy is one of  mutual exploration, not a telling off, they are much less likely to become defensive. There is no learning when there&rsquo;s defensiveness. Ask yourself &ldquo;what do I want the outcome of this conversation to be?&rdquo; Let that guide your approach. Get their perspective. Once you&rsquo;ve stated the feedback piece with specific examples, drop your agenda for a moment and just listen to understand. Ask questions.</p><h3> <strong>  4. After raising their awareness and having a conversation, then (and only then) can you ascertain whether there&rsquo;s a willingness on their behalf to change.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Avoid the temptation to rush into solution mode too quickly. Focus first on getting on the same page as to why it&rsquo;s in their best interests to work on &lsquo;The Thing&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a worlds apart scenario between willing and unwilling. See here for some tips for starters.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Coach.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> Once you have their willingness to change, engage them in idea generation. Don&rsquo;t be so wed to your solution. Is yours a better approach to solving the problem? Maybe. But their ownership in the way forward is more powerful. So jointly find what the way forward looks like. See here for coaching questions to lead and inspire your team.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Don&rsquo;t leave the conversation unless you both have specific next steps and actions that are time-bound.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> This can be anything from &ldquo;given we have different perspectives around this, let&rsquo;s agree to both just watch for this, and reconvene in a month to share what we&rsquo;ve both noted&rdquo; to &ldquo;I can see it might be useful for us to take a breather and give it the overnight test and I&rsquo;ll check in with you tomorrow&rdquo; &ndash; a good one if it was a blind spot and they are upset &ndash; to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s agree you will do X by this date and I will do Y, and we will reflect on progress in a month&rdquo;.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Finally, don&rsquo;t drag your feet and leave someone floundering or not performing for too long.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not fair to them, their team mates, the organisation or to you. Ask yourself &ldquo;if this is still going on in six months, what will that be like?&rdquo; &ldquo;If my boss thought there was an issue with my performance in some area, what would I like her to do?&rdquo; Performance issues need deadlines for resolution.</p><p> What tips do you have for managing non-performance? I would love to hear from you</p>",

    "link": "how-to-bring-adult-children-into-the-advisor-relationship",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I remember my mother shuttling three kids to simultaneous and overlapping doctor appointments, music lessons, Boy Scout events, school, and athletic events, with timing precise enough to make an air traffic controller jealous. As parents, my wife and I had our turn as taxi drivers. And like many of our contemporaries, our time is soon coming to help shuttle parents to their activities and appointments.</p><p> As parents age, many adult children begin to not merely provide taxi service but to accompany parents to appointments, especially doctor visits. This is often helpful for both generations.</p><p> Yet it&rsquo;s much less common for children to sit in on their parents&rsquo; meetings with financial advisors. In almost 35 years as a financial planner, I can count on one hand the clients that have taken the initiative to involve adult children in their financial review meetings. This is something I now recommend. At a minimum, it&rsquo;s wise to regularly include children who are designated in powers of attorney or as executors in estate planning. I advise involving them in meetings with attorneys, accountants, and financial advisors long before a health event demands they take over your financial affairs.</p><p> If this transition happens suddenly, it can be emotionally and financially painful. I have witnessed parents&rsquo; meticulous financial planning undone in almost an instant by children thrown into a situation where they have complete decision-making authority but no education or preparation to help them use it well. In such instances, the advisor often becomes the target for the children&rsquo;s displaced anger and fear around being thrust unprepared into this difficult role.</p><p> Actively involving adult children in meetings with legal and financial advisors can greatly smooth the transition when they do need to step in as the decision makers. By attending several years of meetings, children gradually become educated on the intricacies involved in many estate plans and investment portfolios.</p><p> Here are some tips to bring children into your relationship with an advisor.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Start slowly. </strong></h3><p> <br/> While a gradual education of your children on the particulars of your financial affairs can pay significant dividends, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it is easy. Both generations may be uncomfortable at first. One option is to start with a discussion about the parents&rsquo; general philosophy around managing money and their plans for their estate. Then the conversation can gradually proceed to more specifics.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Make it easy. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Probably your adult children are busy with jobs and families of their own. Offer to bring financial meetings to them via technology. A host of options can allow them to participate remotely.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Be clear on confidentiality issues. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before bringing children into any meeting, discuss with your financial advisor the degree of disclosure and specificity you desire.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Pay attention to emotional as well as financial issues. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Disclosing to adult children the intricacies of parents&rsquo; financial affairs can be overwhelming and fraught with difficult emotions for both parents and kids. Although it is seldom expressed, perhaps the strongest reason for not  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/estate-planning/inheritance-questions-parents-are-afraid-to-answer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   discussing estate plans with family members  </a> </u>  is fear. It&rsquo;s natural for parents to be afraid that children will be angry or disappointed, will build too much on their expectations for an inheritance, or will be resentful of other heirs. Beyond that, some family situations are complicated by such factors as stepfamily issues, difficult relationships, or children with widely differing capabilities around money. In these cases, it may be helpful to bring a financial therapist into the picture.</p><p> Involving adult children in aging parents&rsquo; financial affairs and meetings with advisors is not always easy. Yet the benefits for both parents and children make it well worth the effort.</p>",

    "content": "<p>  </p><p> Written by: Thomas J. Quinn, Chief Investment &amp; Research Officer, Jefferson National </p><p> Sixty-five percent of respondents to the annual <u>  US Trust Insights on Wealth and Worth Survey </u> say that minimizing taxes is an investment priority for managing their wealth, compared to just 35 percent who focus on pursuing higher returns regardless of tax implications. Taxes can be your clients&rsquo; biggest expense&mdash;as much as 50 percent in taxes a year, when federal, state and local taxes are combined. In fact, the average American spends more days working to pay off federal, state and local taxes than they do to cover the costs of housing, food and clothing combined. <a href=\"/?p=4#_edn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [i] </a></p><p> Taxes are not only a costly out of pocket expense for your clients, but also a drain on the performance of their portfolios. This is especially true for your high net worth clients, and when working with your clients to meet long-term financial goals such as retirement saving and legacy planning. But there are solutions. As my recent study shows, advisors can implement a more strategic approach to managing taxes by using Asset Location. The result? Asset Location is a proven strategy to mitigate the impact of taxes on your client&rsquo;s portfolio and increase returns 100-200bps per year&mdash;without increasing risk. <a href=\"/?p=4#_edn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  [ii] </a></p><p> The concept of tax-deferred accumulation is integral to most clients&rsquo; portfolios&mdash;a fundamental tool for achieving long-term financial goals. And to maximize tax deferral to its fullest potential, Asset Location is a strategy that is simple, predictable and reliable.</p><h3> <strong>  Identifying Opportunities for Asset Location </strong> <br/>  </h3><p> Asset Location can potentially increase returns and lead to faster growth of assets by strategically minimizing the impact of taxes. This is accomplished without changing the portfolio allocation, but instead by &ldquo;locating&rdquo; assets in the appropriate vehicle&mdash;taxable or tax-deferred&mdash;based on tax-efficiency.  Quite simply, Asset Location is implemented by locating tax-inefficient assets&mdash;such as fixed income and real estate&mdash;in tax-deferred vehicles, and locating tax-efficient assets&mdash;such as equity ETFs&mdash;in taxable accounts. </p><p> Using Asset Location, you can add more value for your clients&mdash;helping them accumulate more wealth, generate more retirement income and leave a larger legacy. While nearly all clients can benefit from some level of Asset Location, there are certain clients likely to benefit the most:</p><li> Clients who can use more tax deferral alongside  qualified plans</li><li> Clients taxed at a high marginal rate&mdash;especially if their tax rate will be lower at distribution</li><li> Clients whose taxable investable assets exceed their liquidity needs</li><li> Clients whose portfolio holds more tax-inefficient assets or employs a tactical trading strategy</li><li> Clients who seek to maximize accumulation for retirement or legacy planning <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Asset Location can add value, even with a short time horizon&mdash;and in some cases even within the first year, depending on the type of assets and investment strategies being used. </strong></h3><p> <br/> As shown in Figure 1, starting with a $1 million dollar portfolio, with $925,000 in a taxable account, and $75,000 in a tax-deferred IRA.  When the advisor uses an Asset Location strategy, the value of tax deferral almost doubles over 15 years, from $24,856 to $44,502.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-17-at-7.39.48-AM.png\" width=\"711\"/></p><h3> <strong>  Three Steps to Optimize the Benefits of Asset Location </strong></h3><p> <br/> To optimize the benefits of Asset Location, you should follow a systematic approach including three key steps:</p><li> Evaluate the tax-inefficient areas of your clients&rsquo; portfolios</li><li> Extend asset location beyond the low limits of qualified plans</li><li> Regularly identify new asset location opportunities <br/>  </li><p> Start by Evaluating Tax-Inefficiencies: Consider both the retrospective and prospective tax implications of various asset classes and investing strategies. Key indicators include the Tax Cost Ratio, Yield and Tactical Trading.</p><h3> <strong>  Tax Cost Ratio </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mutual funds will distribute taxable income, dividends and gains based on how the fund was managed. The Tax Cost Ratio is a retrospective indicator, calculated by Morningstar, to show how much of a fund's annualized return was reduced by the taxes investors pay on distributions. The higher the Tax Cost Ratio, the more tax-inefficient the fund.</p><h3> <strong>  Impact of Yield on Fixed Income </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many fixed income funds offer a blend of capital appreciation and income (also referred to as yield). The amount of return coming from yield is directly related to the size of the tax bill. For example, a client invested in High Yield Bond funds over the past ten years would have paid more than 41% of their return to taxes on distributions. When investing in fixed income funds where returns are distributed primarily as yield, clients can quickly realize more value through Asset Location. This benefit will increase the longer taxes can be deferred.</p><h3> <strong>  Impact of Tactical Trading </strong></h3><p> <br/> Certain assets are tax-efficient, but become tax-inefficient based on how they are managed. Tactical allocation strategies try to improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio by actively shifting allocations across investments. But this return seeking turnover has the potential to lead to more short term capital gains&mdash;and higher tax bills. When using tactical management or investing in actively managed funds, Asset Location can add more value.</p><h3> <strong>  Next, Extend Asset Location Beyond Qualified Plans </strong></h3><p> <br/> Qualified plans have their limits. This past year, the maximum annual contribution to a 401(k) plan was $18,000, plus a $6,000 catch up option for individuals age 50 or older; for IRAs the annual contribution is only $5,500, with a $1,000 catch up option. Many clients can benefit from additional tax-deferred growth.</p><p> To increase the size of the tax deferred pie and extend the Asset Location opportunity, one proven solution is an Investment-Only Variable Annuity (IOVA). Several factors must be considered before choosing the right IOVA, including no commissions, low or flat fees, and a broad suite of investment options, to allow you to execute your investment strategies as necessary.</p><p> Considering the same client from Figure 1, with a starting balance of $1 million, the advisor can instead allocate $550,000 in the taxable account, locate $75,000 in the tax-deferred IRA, and locate an additional $375,000 of tax-inefficient assets in an IOVA. As shown in Figure 2, by extending Asset Location with an IOVA, the value of tax deferral over 15 years increases even further, from $44,502 (Figure 1) to $68,250 (Figure 2).</p><h3> <strong>  Finally, Seek New Asset Location Opportunities </strong></h3><p> <br/> Throughout the year, you can identify new opportunities to implement Asset Location. This can include periods of normal portfolio rebalancing or year-end tax-loss harvesting, when you can locate more assets into taxable and tax-deferred vehicles based on tax-efficiencies. </p><h3> <strong>  Conclusion </strong></h3><p> <br/> In recent years US tax rates have increased, creating an even larger tax bill for clients. In 2015, Americans paid a total tax bill of $4.8 trillion, or 31% of national incomei. But using these three steps to implement an Asset Location strategy, you can minimize the impact of taxes and help your clients grow more wealth, potentially increasing returns by 100 &ndash; 200 bps per year&mdash;without increasing risk. In this challenging environment of high taxes, a strategic approach to managing taxes using Asset Location can add greater value for your clients, and your firm.</p><p> To download the full white paper &ldquo;A Strategic Approach to Managing Taxes&rdquo; by Thomas J.

    "title": "The Number One Strategic Challenge for Advisor Firms",
    "link": "the-number-one-strategic-challenge-for-advisor-firms",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> For most professional services firms today the Number 1 strategic challenge is determining what the the right strategy for the firm actually is.</h3><p> <br/> It would easily be THE single thing that firms I talk to are wrestling with, and it is understandable to a large degree. Changing remuneration and business models, changing regulations with new restrictions and new potential opportunities, changing consumer expectations&hellip;.it all adds up to very confusing times indeed for anyone trying to determine the right way forward. It is not helped by the confusion over what strategy is, as opposed to what business planning is, or what tactics are.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s be clear firstly about what strategy actually is: it is &ldquo;the big cunning idea&rdquo; that guides the planning process.  It is the concept which links the detailed planning and tactics to the achievement of the long term vision or goal.  The strategy is the big idea on how we will compete, or differentiate.</p><p> My favourite analogy for explaining strategy is the story of Sir Peter Blake and the Team New Zealand America&rsquo;s Cup campaign.  They managed to excite a nation &ndash; even those not interested in yachting &ndash; which is why I use the story, as everyone (in NZ) remembers it.  Blake&rsquo;s strategy for winning this yachting regatta was a simple one:</p><h3> Have the fastest boat.</h3><p> <br/> As far as strategies go it is remarkably effective in that is simple and easily articulated, and easily remembered by everyone involved in achieving the vision.  He was lauded for the brilliance of his strategy too&hellip;.which I always found amusing. Here&rsquo;s the thing: in something like 150 years of America&rsquo;s Cup yacht racing pretty much every entrant had the same strategy: &ldquo;have the fastest boat&rdquo;.</p><p> The strategy was not new by any stretch of the imagination, and nor was it particularly cunning for that matter.  It was no different to the strategy of every other competitor in the history of the competition in reality.</p><p> So what did make it brilliant?  He applied a testing question to every decision made by every person involved in the campaign: &ldquo;will it make the boat go faster?</p><p> Whether it was a different sail design, changing a crew member, trimming the boat or adding new resources and technology, the question applied to every decision point by every person in the organisation was &ldquo;will it make the boat go faster?&rdquo;</p><p> This testing question is the brilliance of Peter Blake as a leader.  In a simple way he managed to ensure the link between the vision (winning the regatta) and the strategy to achieve it (have the fastest boat) were able to be applied to the tactical and business planning (&ldquo;should we do this or that?&rdquo;).  With the addition of a well constructed testing question an organisation was transformed from a hierarchal organisation to a team where everyone was pursuing the same vision, understood the strategy and was able to make sound decisions at whatever their level in the organisation.</p><p> There are a couple of points that todays professionals should take out of this story:</p><li> A compelling and competitive strategy does not have to be unique, or even new.</li><li> The success of the chosen strategy often comes down to how well it is articulated and executed.</li><li> The REAL key to the success of a strategy for the firm is in anyone in the firm being able to apply a testing question to any decision which is required to be made by any persona at any level inside the firm. <br/>  </li><p> This last point is the missing ingredient for many:  to make a strategy actually work for the firm you need to be able to test all decision points against the chosen strategy.  Without that testing question there is the very real risk (and frequent actual occurrence) of making business decisions without any regard to the competitive strategy that the firm decided to adopt in the first place.</p><h3> A simple example from a real firm will help illustrate the points:</h3><p> <br/> A large practice with diverse business lines has ageing Principals.  They are looking to exit the business within the next 3 years, and wish to extract maximum value from their shareholding.  The vision is simple: sell the practice as a going concern business at a premium price.</p><p> Their strategy is a simple one also, and not entirely unique: Great people + loyal clients + world class systems.</p><p> Every decision moving forward, whether that is re-designing employee remuneration systems, leasing new company vehicles, changing the telephone system or building a mobile app for clients is tested with the simple question:</p><h3> &ldquo;Would another firm pay a premium price for that?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> This question guides and shapes all decisions moving forward.  Common business decisions, such as leasing company cars, become very simple to answer: &ldquo;there is no special value in leasing newer/more expensive cars, and increasing the contingent liability on the balance sheet doesn&rsquo;t create capital value&rdquo;</p><p> On the other hand, a different facet of the business with a similar budget size was put forward: &ldquo;We can create a customised CRM with workflow embedding all of our best practice processes and unique approaches to customer service and engagement, and have that become the cornerstone of the firm&rsquo;s IP&rdquo;.  </p><p> Testing question: &ldquo;Would another firm pay a premium price for that?&rdquo;</p><p> Answer: &ldquo;Highly likely&rdquo;.</p><p> It becomes very easy to work out where the money should be invested doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> The missing ingredient in bringing the strategy to life inside the business for many service firms is the lack of the testing question.   Once the firm&rsquo;s chosen strategy has been crafted, put as much effort again into getting the testing question refined.  It will be the one big thing you do which brings the strategy to life, and actually makes it work for you.</p>",

    "title": "6 Key Questions to Ask a Financial Advisor",
    "link": "6-key-questions-to-ask-a-financial-advisor",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p><strong>Finding a financial advisor who is right for you is an important process.</strong>A good financial advisor is there to prevent you from making decisions that would have a negative, unintended impact on you. Who wouldn&rsquo;t love to have a financial coach to keep you on track to achieve your financial goals?Just like with any working relationship, it&rsquo;s a good idea to interview advisors until you find the one who is the best fit for you, your life, and your financial goals. Since you are entrusting your financial well-being to someone, you should get to know them and their financial planning and investing philosophy before committing to a long-term relationship.As you may have heard the Department of Labor (DOL) has just released its new fiduciary rule in its final form. We previously wrote about the reasons why someone would <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/still-worth-retirement-advisors-time/\" target=\"_blank\"> oppose this rule </a> considering it was created to improve financial transparency and eliminate conflicted advice from advisors. While this rule would still allow advisors to keep their &ldquo;conflicted&rdquo; commissions in some instances, it would require advisors to act as fiduciaries (a.k.a. &ldquo;best interests contract&rdquo;) when handling client&rsquo;s retirement accounts. <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/the-most-important-question-youll-ever-ask-your-financial-advisor/\" target=\"_blank\"> We have long been proponents </a> of more transparency and conflict-free advice and feel this is a step in the right direction.So how does this affect your search for the right financial advisor? Here are 6 questions to ask to help with finding a financial advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Are You a Fiduciary? (Are You ALWAYS a Fiduciary?)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, this new rule will only require financial advisors to act as a fiduciary for client&rsquo;s retirement accounts. A fiduciary is regulated by federal law and must adhere to strict standards. They must act in the client&rsquo;s best interest, in good faith, and they must provide full disclosure regarding fees, compensation, and any current or potential conflicts of interest.Until now, broker-dealers, insurance salesman, bank and financial company representatives, and others were only required to follow a Suitability Standard. That means they only had to provide recommendations that are &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; for a client &ndash; based on age or aversion to risk for example &ndash; but this may or may not be in that client&rsquo;s best interest.The brokerage industry, as you can probably imagine, and all those who earn their compensation from commissions are strongly against these new rules.Even with this new law passed, we feel it is important to make sure your advisor is acting as a fiduciary when dealing with ANY of your finances, not just retirement accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What is Your Fee Structure? (Difference Between Fee-Only, Fee-Based and Commission)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Advisors throw out terms like &ldquo;fee-based&rdquo; and consumers assume that is the same as&ldquo;fee-only.&rdquo; That is not the case. At Sherman Wealth Management, we are fee-only which means that we are paid exclusively by our clients, so we are completely conflict-free. We do not get commissions from the investments or products we recommend. We do not get bonuses based on how many clients we get to invest in company products. We are paid an hourly or quarterly fee by our clients who retain us because we are making their money work for them with only their best interest in mind.Think of it this way: would you want to work with an accountant who also gets commissions from the IRS? Of course not. You want your accountant to represent your best interests. Would you go to a doctor who makes money each time he prescribes penicillin? No, you want your doctor to prescribe what is right for you.Do not assume that an advisor is following a fiduciary standard with their compensation now. The new rules will not be enforced until 2018. Ask your financial advisor to clearly specify their fees. With many layers of diversification that can be applied to your portfolio, you want to be aware of whether you are exposed to up-front charges, back-end fees, expense ratios, and/or whether a percentage of your returns will be deducted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Why Are They Right for YOU?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A financial advisor should be able to tell you their strengths and what sets them apart. Some advisors will advise on investments while others specialize in comprehensive financial planning. While you may think all advisors are the same, and it certainly may seem like that on the surface, by now you should be seeing that is not the case.Ask how involved they are with their client&rsquo;s portfolios. Are they hands-on in their approach? How available are they for their clients&rsquo; needs?For us, we enjoy serving a wide-range of clients, from young first-timers who are just getting started with investing and financial planning, to experienced savers, to high-net-worth investors who are well on their way to financial independence.We strive to understand our clients wants and needs. We help our clients plan for the long term while simultaneously working to avoid short-term roadblocks. We do so by making it a point to SHOW you that you are not alone. We&rsquo;re just like you, we&rsquo;ve been there, and we know that financial planning can be an anxiety provoking activity for many. We use a fluid process to help set clear, realistic goals with an easy to understand roadmap of what you need to do to get there. We are right there with you every step of the way.In today&rsquo;s world you don&rsquo;t just want a trusted advisor, you want instant access to your accounts and the progress you are making. That is why we offer some of the best in new financial services technology tools.The relationship with your financial advisor is an important one. You need to feel comfortable with whom you are working with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What is Your Investment Philosophy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every financial advisor has a specific approach to planning and investing. Some advisors prefer trying to time the market and <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/dont-expect-win-actively-managed-funds/\" target=\"_blank\"> actively manage funds versus passive investments .</a> Others may seek to gain high returns and make riskier investments. Your goals and risk tolerance need to align with the advisor&rsquo;s philosophy.When anyone invests money, they are doing so with the hopes of growing it faster than inflation. While some traditional investment managers not only want to generate a profitable return, they aim to beat the market by taking advantage of pricing discrepancies and attempting to time the market and predict the future. Some investment companies offer &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; investment management solutions that only take into account your age and income.We have a different approach. We believe an individuals best chance at building wealth through the capital markets is to avoid common <a href=\"https://www.shermanwealth.com/behavioral-finance-and-instinctive-behaviors/\" target=\"_blank\"> behavioral biases </a> in the beginning and utilize a well thought out, disciplined, and long-term approach to investing. We create a well diversified, customized portfolio that focuses on tax efficiency, cost effectiveness, and risk management. Read more about <a href=\"http://www.shermanwealth.com/our-investment-philosophy/\" target=\"_blank\"> how we do this.</a>Make it a top priority to understand the strategy your advisor uses and that you are comfortable with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. How Personalized Are Your Recommendations for Your Clients?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important that your financial advisor tailors your financial plan to your specific goals. Your retirement plan and investment strategy should be customized to take into account your risk tolerance, age, income, net-worth, and other factors specific to your situation. There should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to managing your money.Some traditional brokers and insurance companies are so big that it becomes impossible for them to give you a truly individualized experience. They have a corporate agenda that they must follow and it can restrict the service they provide to you.As frustrating as the requirement for a high minimum balance is for first-time investors, it has also inspired a new breed of smaller independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), like Sherman Wealth Management. What our clients all have in common is that they appreciate the focus on their own individual goals and best interests that we guarantee as a boutique, independent, fee-only fiduciary.We know that each client is unique. We don&rsquo;t look for &ldquo;market efficiencies&rdquo; or work for sales commissions on the products we recommend. Our focus is different. We strive to help investors build a strong foundation and grow with them, not by profiting off good or bad trades. This gives us the opportunity to create individual strategies and plans that are uniquely suited to each client, not just a cookie-cutter plan based on age, income, or broadly assessed risk tolerance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Do You Have Any Asset or Revenue Minimums?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some have argued that the proposed DOL rule will end up hurting the small investor because larger institutions will not be willing to serve small accounts. This logic is fundamentally backward and flawed, as those clients were never on their radar to begin with. In fact, the ability for these large institutions to generate commissions and thus charge more to these small investor clients have driven that business, without regard to the best interests of the individual investor.For example, In a company statement quoted by Janet Levaux in Think Advisor, Wells Fargo, the most valuable financial institution in the world according to the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-co-is-the-earths-most-valuable-bank-1437538216\" target=\"_blank\"> Wall Street Journal </a>, said that in 2016, &ldquo;bonuses will be awarded to FAs with 75% of their client households at $250,000.&rdquo;Wells Fargo isn&rsquo;t the only large institution effectively ignoring Millennials and other smaller and entry-level clients. Most of the corporate institutions prefer high-net-worth clients because it creates &ldquo;efficiencies of scale&rdquo; and a higher profit margin on larger trades.The complaints against the new DOL rule have nothing to do with protecting the little guy. Rather, the complaints are driven by the desire of commission-based large institutions, insurance companies, and broker-dealers who are trying to protect their ability to generate commissions and charge clients unnecessary fees.Make sure you understand your advisor&rsquo;s motivations. If they don&rsquo;t want you, why should you want them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iris.xyz/viewpoints/does-your-financial-advisor-help-to-improve-your-overall-life/\">Does Your Financial Advisor Help to Improve Your Overall Life?</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Eamon Porter</p><p> Every so often I meet a personal investor who will tell me that now is the right time or the wrong time to invest, depending on whether the markets are going up or down as well as depending on that individual&rsquo;s past experience.</p><h3> Despite having 30 years of investment experience I never get into an argument with them because I know something they don&rsquo;t.</h3><p> <br/> Namely, very, very experienced investment professionals rarely, if ever, out think the markets. Even the greats such as Warren Buffet and Anthony Bolton acknowledge that markets cannot be outguessed in the short term and their own success owes more to long term holdings rather than short term trading outlooks.</p><p> In any event, many people who are inexperienced in dealing with investment markets (and even some who are experienced) tend to look for signs that they are right in the perspective of what is happening at any point in time. They look for reassurance about what they are thinking, or more correctly hoping, can be confirmed by one or more public facts about the markets. In Behavioural Finance terms this is referred to as Confirmation Bias. Put simply, people favour information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses even if such confirmations turn out later to be false indicators.</p><h3> This behaviour is also closely linked with Herd Mentality.</h3><p> <br/> In essence, this is where people are influenced by their peers by adopting certain behaviours and follow trends as well as possibly purchasing items. Investment history is riddled with Herd Mentality events from Tulipmania in 1637 through to recent times when global property bubbles made many seem smart before looking extremely foolish.</p><p> <strong>  Newness Bias is also a well documented behavioural trait and is the desire to give more weight to recent information and ideas usually to support a particular investment outlook. </strong> This helps to support the belief that one is right because the latest set of economic data says so. Does this sound familiar?</p><p> The use of these three outlooks on investing works both ways. If markets are going upwards, they are used to justify why one should invest. Similarly, if markets are going in the opposite direction they are likewise used as justification as to why one should not invest in particular assets. It just depends on your starting position.</p><h3> So the question is, if one cannot outguess the markets what should you do?</h3><p> <br/> The starting point for all investing lies not in what markets are doing but rather in what you actually need in your own personal life. By defining what our own individual objectives are we can then set about expressing these in financial terms. Of course, such planning is not a simple process and requires a lot of thought but in my experience once this whole area is addressed properly investment decisions and their long-term effects become more realistic, as does the evaluation of competing investment options.</p><p> After that it comes down to long-term planning, and not short-term reactions to investment flavours of the month. The great thing about such an approach is it allows investors to exert control over their financial outlooks rather than being held hostage to them. In other words by controlling what we can control, namely our behaviour, we can have a disproportionate positive effect on our financial well-being. This isn&rsquo;t just my view or any recent perspective. Considerable research has been done on this. As far back as 2000 Meir Statman, a distinguished economics professor based in Santa Clara University in California, produced research which showed that 93% of investor returns are influenced by their own personal decisions and not those of individual fund managers or indeed the performance of investment markets.</p><p> The bottom line? Before you make a decision to jump in and out of markets, think about what your investment objectives are and whether they are aligned to your, correct, asset allocation. If there is a mismatch then the issue isn&rsquo;t markets but is more personal. And for that, you need to be aware of your own behavioural impulses as these influence your financial position more than anything else.</p>",

It goes into effect June 6, 2016  </u>    </a> so let&rsquo;s jump right into it and get this knocked out!</p><h3> What&rsquo;s All This About?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re a Registered Rep, then you likely know  <u>  <a href=\"http://brokercheck.finra.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FINRA has the BrokerCheck utility on their website  </a> </u> . The BrokerCheck allows consumers to learn more about a registered rep and make sure they are in good standing. It&rsquo;s like the BBB for broker backgrounds. Well, it&rsquo;s coming to your website now too.</p><p> Recently, FINRA Rule 2210 states an advisor must provide a link to this utility on your website so your consumers have easy access to by simply clicking while there. FINRA is giving registered reps until June 6, 2016 to comply. You&rsquo;ve got a couple of months &ndash; so don&rsquo;t sweat it yet! What&rsquo;s very important to understand is the details of WHERE the link must be placed though:</p><p> Effective June 6, 2016, FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public) requires a firm to include a readily apparent reference and hyperlink to BrokerCheck on the initial Web page that the firm intends to be viewed by retail investors, and any other Web page that includes a professional profile of one or more registered persons, who conduct business with retail investors. See more <a href=\"http://www.finra.org/industry/notices/15-50\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p><h3> Who Needs to Comply?</h3><p> <br/> If you&rsquo;re a Registered Rep and you have a consumer-facing website, you have to comply. Again, be very careful to understand the bolded comments provided above. This notice must be on any page where a professional bio exists of a registered rep, the initial page your firm uses (so typically the Home page of a website, but could be a Landing page if you use it for lead generation) and any other page which would contain your bio.</p><p> I would even caution to include this interpretation also means  your LinkedIn profile. Although the ruling doesn&rsquo;t outright state this, I feel it&rsquo;s a matter of time before they clarify it. Your profile is a biographical representation of who you are and your background. Providing a link to the BrokerCheck utility at FINRA seems not only safe but very transparent.</p><h3> What Do I Need to Do?</h3><p> <br/> You need to work with whoever manages your website and make sure they understand the implications of this ruling. Updating your website, your LinkedIn profile, and any other place where a bio of you as a registered rep exists is mandatory. Failure to comply always equals a penalty of some sort. </p><p> Do not wait to comply; get it done today. If you need help, reach out and ask me. I can provide instructions or even help you get your LinkedIn profile updated so you avoid trouble with something so small.</p><p> Again, I know rules are a pain the butt. However, FINRA wants to keep you and the consumer safe and informed. Let me know if you need assistance.</p><p> Be bigger, better and more BIONIC today.</p>",

    "link": "what-to-trust-measuring-the-chinese-economy",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewsAsia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Andy Rothman  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Matthews Asia  </u> </a></p><p> A question that is posed frequently by those skeptical over the health of China&rsquo;s economy is: &ldquo;If electricity consumption and rail freight traffic are both weak, how can GDP be expanding by more than 6%?&rdquo; This is a great question because the answer highlights the dramatic pace of change in the structure of China&rsquo;s economy. In today&rsquo;s Sinology, we explore the reasons why the so-called &ldquo;Li Keqiang Index&rdquo; is a poor way to assess China&rsquo;s growth, and offer some better metrics. <br/> <br/> The structure of China&rsquo;s economy has changed so much over the past decade that we need to change the way we measure its growth. Services and consumption have replaced manufacturing and construction as the largest part of the economy. These shifts have led, for example, to a decline in power consumption, but a sharp rise in express package delivery. In China, as in the U.S., growth is driven by consumer spending, and we have plenty of ways to check the official data. Apple, for example, reports that its greater China revenue rose 14% in the most recent quarter, and Mercedes sales were up 50% in January. And, it is worth noting that power consumption by the services and consumer-related sectors rose 7.5% in 2015.</p><h3> <strong>  It Began with a 2007 Dinner Chat </strong></h3><p> <br/> The origin of the focus on power and rail freight comes from an obscure source&mdash;a private dinner conversation in early 2007 between then U.S. Ambassador to China Clark T. (Sandy) Randt, Jr. and current Premier Li Keqiang, who at the time was the Communist Party Secretary of Liaoning Province.  <br/> <br/> Li Keqiang was invited to the ambassador&rsquo;s residence in Beijing because he was a rising star within the Party leadership. (The following year he was promoted to vice premier, and in 2013, he became premier.) When Ambassador Randt asked Li to comment on economic conditions in 2007, Li&rsquo;s response, according to official embassy notes, was: &ldquo;GDP figures are &lsquo;man-made&rsquo; and therefore unreliable.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> The notes also indicated: &ldquo;When evaluating Liaoning's economy,  [Li said he]focuses on three figures: 1) electricity consumption, which was up 10 percent in Liaoning last year; 2) volume of rail cargo, which is fairly accurate because fees are charged for each unit of weight; and 3) amount of loans disbursed, which also tends to be accurate given the interest fees charged. By looking at these three figures, Li said he can measure with relative accuracy the speed of economic growth. All other figures, especially GDP statistics, are &lsquo;for reference only,&rsquo; he said smiling.&rdquo; <br/> <br/> The ambassador&rsquo;s report on his conversation with Li was classified as &ldquo;CONFIDENTIAL,&rdquo; meaning it was only to be read by U.S. government officials with security clearances. Then came WikiLeaks, which made this document, in addition to thousands of other classified reports, available to the public, and that led some analysts and pundits to refer to the &ldquo;Li Keqiang Index&rdquo; for the Chinese economy. <br/> <br/> Superficially, this index sounds sensible, especially since it came from a senior Party official who thought he was speaking privately. More careful scrutiny, however, reveals Mr. Li&rsquo;s index to be as backward-looking as judging the health of the American economy based on sales of BlackBerry phones . . . or the growth of power consumption.</p><h3> <strong>  Power Problems </strong></h3><p> <br/> Let&rsquo;s start with electricity. Significantly slower growth in power consumption reflects the rebalancing of China&rsquo;s economy, away from heavy industry and toward services and consumption. <br/> <br/> In 2006, the year before Li spoke with the ambassador, China&rsquo;s construction boom was nearing its peak, and the economy was driven by power-intensive industries, such as steel and cement. Total industrial value-added rose 17% year-over-year (YoY), steel production rose 18%, cement output was up 16%, and the secondary part of the economy (manufacturing and construction) accounted for 47% of GDP. Liaoning, where Li was the top provincial official, had a very high concentration of construction-related sectors, and in his dinner with Ambassador Randt, he boasted that provincial GDP growth was 12.8%. <br/> <br/> Nationally, booming heavy industry drove electricity consumption up 14% in 2006, while GDP growth was almost 13%. At that time, across China&mdash;but especially Liaoning Province&mdash;there was a very high correlation between power and economic growth. But, the times they are a-changin&rsquo;. <br/> <br/> The peak in the growth rate of China&rsquo;s fixed-asset investment (FAI)&mdash;a good indicator of construction activity&mdash;was 30% YoY in 2009, but that slowed last year to 10%. Industrial value-added last year rose 6%, down from 17% in 2006. Steel production declined 2% last year, compared to an increase of 18% in 2006. As a result, last year, China&rsquo;s overall electricity consumption rose only 0.5%, and industrial power consumption was down by about 1%. But, does this signal that GDP growth should have been flat or negative? <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Growth rate of cement production, steel production and value added of industry\" src=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/resources/img/Sinology/030816/01_Cement_WEB_500.gif\"/></p><p> Last year, the tertiary (services and consumption) part of the economy accounted for just over 50% of GDP for the first time, compared to a 42% share in 2006, while the secondary (manufacturing and construction) share declined to 41% from 47% . The power-intensive part of the economy shrank while the less energy-guzzling services sector expanded. Last year, consumption contributed 66% of GDP growth, compared to a 42% share in 2006.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/resources/img/Sinology/030816/02_POWER.gif\"/></p><p> Industry consumes 71% of China&rsquo;s power, but is a shrinking part of China&rsquo;s economy, so it isn&rsquo;t surprising that overall power use is growing much more slowly than the overall economy. On the other hand, power consumption by the services and consumer-related sectors rose 7.5% last year, and residential power use was up 5%. <br/> <br/> The structure of China&rsquo;s economy has changed significantly over just a decade, rendering electricity consumption a far less meaningful gauge of overall economic activity. Consider that in the U.S. last year, overall power consumption fell 1% YoY, with industrial use down 4%, while GDP rose by more than 2%. Like China, the U.S. economy is driven more by services and consumption, and less by power-intensive heavy industry, weakening the correlation between the growth rates of power consumption and GDP. <br/> <br/> Finally, I want to mention one other aspect of the power issue. Some have argued that electricity consumption is one of the few Chinese data sets they trust. But, if you think Beijing is lying about most economic data, why do you trust the power numbers? Almost all of the power is generated, transmitted and distributed by state-owned firms, so if the government is attempting to cover up a much steeper economic slowdown, why aren&rsquo;t they fudging the power numbers as part of that effort?</p><h3> <strong>  All the Live-Long Day </strong></h3><p> <br/> The second component of the so-called Li Keqiang Index is rail freight. Back in 2006, the volume of rail freight rose by about 7% YoY, while last year it declined 12%. As with the power story, this reflects significant structural changes. <br/> <br/> The biggest change is that in 2006, rail carried 14% of China&rsquo;s total freight traffic, a share that fell to only 7% last year. Highways now carry 79% of total freight now, up from 72% in 2006, and highway traffic rose 6% last year. Focusing solely on rail traffic today would be akin to tracking sales of print media in the U.S. while ignoring online readers. <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Railway freight far less important\" src=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/resources/img/Sinology/030816/03_Railway_WEB.gif\"/></p><p> It is also important to note that a key reason for significantly slower growth in rail freight traffic is that more than 50% of rail freight is coal. Thus, to a great extent, slower growth in rail traffic reflects slower growth in power generation, which, as I explained earlier, reflects slower growth in energy-intensive industrial sectors. <br/> <br/> And, consistent with the strong growth in the consumer economy, especially online retail, express parcel deliveries in China rose 48% YoY last year, after rising 52% in 2014.</p><h3> <strong>  Bank Loans </strong></h3><p> <br/> The final component of the so-called Li Keqiang Index, according to the U.S. embassy report, is the amount of loans disbursed. This was an odd choice for Li, given that all of the country&rsquo;s banks are state-controlled and aggregate lending is limited by a government-set quota. But let&rsquo;s take a look at what these numbers tell us. <br/> <br/> New bank loans disbursed last year were about 2.7 times greater than the amount issued in 2006, and the average annual increase in new lending was 17.7% during that period.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/resources/img/Sinology/030816/04_Loans.gif\"/></p><p> This is not, however, our preferred metric for monitoring the availability of credit. Aggregate credit&mdash;including bonds, entrusted loans and other financing channels, plus bank loans&mdash;is a better gauge. It is something China&rsquo;s central bank calls Total Social Finance (TSF). Moreover, I prefer to monitor the growth rate of TSF outstanding, rather than just the new flow, as that is a better reflection of the availability of credit. <br/> <br/> TSF outstanding rose 19% YoY in 2006 and then 22% in 2007, before rocketing to 35% in 2009 in support of China&rsquo;s huge stimulus response to the Global Financial Crisis. By 2011, the growth rate of TSF outstanding was back to the 2006 level at 19%. Last year, the growth rate was 12%.</p><p> As the next chart illustrates, the growth rate of aggregate credit outstanding has decelerated in line with the deceleration in nominal GDP growth&mdash;a sensible change, in my view. <br/> <br/> <img alt=\"Credit outstanding decelerating along with GDP growth\" src=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/resources/img/Sinology/030816/05_Credit.gif\"/></p><h3> <strong>  What Does Work? </strong></h3><p> <br/> If not the Li Keqiang Index, then what metrics should investors use to assess the health of the Chinese economy? For starters, not the GDP growth rate. <br/> <br/> GDP growth may be the least important statistic in China. After all, we don&rsquo;t make investment decisions in the U.S. or Europe based on GDP growth rates. As in other markets, the important stats in China concern employment, income, inflation and consumer spending. In my view, we have far better visibility into these topics now than we had in the past because of the growing role of privately owned Chinese firms, the significant participation by foreign-owned firms in the domestic economy, and because foreigners are now able to conduct independent surveys of business conditions. <br/> <br/> China&rsquo;s old economy was weak last year, and that will continue this year, especially in heavy industries, such as steel and cement. China has passed its peak in the growth of construction of infrastructure and new homes. But manufacturing has not collapsed, with a private survey revealing that wages at privately owned factories were up 5% to 6% in 4Q15 (compared to 6% to 8% a year earlier), reflecting a fairly tight labor market. Crude oil imports by volume rose 9% (after rising 9% in 2014), and the volume of copper imports was up 12%. <br/> <br/> I expect the consumer story to remain strong for several reasons. Income, while decelerating along with the rest of the economy, should grow by more than 6% in real terms this year. This follows a decade of more than 130% real income growth, compared to about 11% growth in real per capita disposable personal income in the U.S. over the same period. I expect another year of moderate consumer price inflation, at about 1.5%. Household debt is very low, and the savings rate very high. All of that contributed to an 11% rise in real retail sales last year. <br/> <br/> We can check that official retail sales statistic against numbers from private sources. Apple, for example, reported that during its 1Q16 period its greater China revenue rose 14% (compared to a 4% decline in the U.S.) while Nike said its shoe sales were up 30% during the quarter ending in November. The Japanese government told us that last year, Chinese visitor arrivals rose 107%, after an 83% increase in 2014, and that Chinese spent more than twice as much as the average visitor. In January, Ford&rsquo;s vehicle sales in China rose 36% YoY, while Cadillac sales increased 16%, the sixth consecutive month of double-digit sales growth, according to GM. Mercedes reports that its unit sales in China rose more than 50% in January.</p><h3> <strong>  Slower, But No Signs of Collapse </strong></h3><p> <br/> As I&rsquo;ve been saying for some time in my commentaries, it is inevitable that most Chinese economic statistics will grow at gradually slower year-over-year rates for many years to come. This is due in part to structural changes, including a shrinking workforce, and because after three decades of 10% growth, the base has become too big to sustain double-digit expansion.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://us.matthewsasia.com/resources/img/Sinology/030816/06_Production_Web.gif\"/> <br/> Too few investors (as well as too few pundits and journalists) recognize that 2015 was the fourth consecutive year in which the manufacturing and construction part of the economy was smaller than the consumption and services part. Consumption accounted for about two-thirds of GDP growth, illustrating that the economy has rebalanced away from a dependence on exports, heavy industry and investment, and has, in my view, become the world&rsquo;s best consumption story. This mitigates weakness in manufacturing and construction, and, if this rebalancing continues, it should mean that macro deceleration will be gradual.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Early in my career I went on a sales call doing the usual amount of prep to hold up my end of the conversation, expecting that the prospect would have prepared something of their own.</p><p> I was wrong. They had nothing. They wanted me to direct the whole thing. Luckily I pulled it all together and sailed the ship through for the both of us, but it could have all been avoided if I had done one simple thing: confirm the meeting. (Which I would have done <a href=\"http://spirohq.com/home/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">     <u>   if I had Spiro back then to help remind me of this crucial step  </u> </a> .)</p><h3> If You&rsquo;re Not Confirming Meetings, You&rsquo;re Making a Big Mistake</h3><p> <br/> Meeting confirmations aren&rsquo;t just another box to be checked on your to-do list. They&rsquo;re a huge opportunity to influence your prospect or customer.</p><p> In the case above, confirming the meeting would have put thoughts into both of our heads beforehand and the meeting could have been more productive.</p><p> I could have sent them a list of the things I wanted to talk about, they could have researched my questions, had hard numbers ready, etc. But instead, we had to take follow up time to get all that done.</p><h3> Turn Meeting Confirmations Into Sales Engagement Moments</h3><p> <br/> Taking a small amount of time out of your schedule to confirm the meeting can actually save you a lot of time and effort. Instead of seeing it as a pain, look at the ways you can use the meeting confirmation email as another opportunity to sell or to gather information on the prospective client.</p><p> Gather information on your client and what they hope to get from the meeting by asking questions like:</p><li> Who else is coming to the meeting?</li><li> Do you think we should invite Todd from the accounting department?</li><li> Who else at XYZ Corp should I be meeting with while I&rsquo;m there?</li><li> Are there other people in St. Louis you think I should see while I&rsquo;m in town?</li><li> Do we have the right agenda for the meeting? <br/>  </li><p> The personal interaction will be much more useful to you than what you would get from some relationship app.</p><h3> Confirming Meetings Makes You Look Professional</h3><p> <br/> Meetings take planning and effort, but a successful meeting can go a long way to building lasting relationships with your clients.</p><p> One of the things the Spiro app does for salespeople is make sure they confirm upcoming meetings. Spiro automatically reads your calendar and, boop, you see a prompt (and even a convenient email template) to confirm your meeting.</p><h3> Meeting Confirmation Emails Have a 90 Percent Open Rate</h3><p> <br/> The meeting confirmation emails I send out have a 90 percent open rate, how many other times in your life can you say that&rsquo;s true?</p><p> It&rsquo;s proven that people retain information through repetition so now&rsquo;s the perfect time to reinforce your core sales message.</p><p> If your financial services software enables companies to trade faster, for example, your confirmation email should say, &ldquo;Looking forward to showing how we can improve your trading time next Tuesday. Are we still good for that meeting?&rdquo;</p><h3> Not Confirming a Sales Meeting is a Missed Opportunity</h3><p> <br/> It comes from my experience from prospects that not confirming a meeting through email can result in a prospect being confused or not prepared for a meeting. That&rsquo;s a waste of both of your time.</p><p> Not only will confirming a meeting avoid any misunderstandings, it is also an opportunity to reinforce your value proposition and influence the direction of the meeting.</p><p> Think of that little email confirmation template you use in  <a href=\"https://spirohq.com/home/features/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Spiro </a>  as that extra step that makes all the difference to get the big deals you&rsquo;re after.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <strong>  Are you looking to your millennial talent base for your next leaders? </strong> If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re missing out. These employees, born between 1980 and 2000, are the largest generation in the entire U.S. workforce. However, not nearly enough companies are investing the time and energy into bringing millennials, or Gen Y, into leadership positions. That&rsquo;s a mistake.</p><p> Look at the mismatch that  <a href=\"http://dupress.com/articles/developing-leaders-perennial-issue-human-capital-trends-2015/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Deloitte </a> &rsquo;s and Virtuali&rsquo;s findings show:</p><li> Only 28% of millennials believe their current company is making full use of their skills</li><li> Only 6% of companies report they have &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; programs to develop this generation</li><li> However, 53% of these young employees aspire to leadership positions in their current organization</li><li> 95% of them believe it&rsquo;s important for companies to offer leadership development activities <br/>  </li><p> Companies failing their employees &mdash; their millennial workforce is more than willing to put in the time and effort to train and develop their skills to become leaders. We need to be doing much better in supporting their careers, because it&rsquo;s a win-win situation; offering leadership opportunities will engage them, meaning you&rsquo;ll have far less turnover.</p><h3> <strong>  What Does Leadership Mean to Gen Y? </strong></h3><p> <br/> Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of believing that leadership means simply new titles and raises. A company&rsquo;s hierarchy doesn&rsquo;t necessarily align perfectly with leadership, meaning that experiences and responsibilities mean far more than empty titles.</p><p> The #FOMO, or fear of missing out, culture means that this generation is chasing the next great experience. In fact, according to the Virtuali study, 78% of them say they value experience over possessions. You as a company need to give them those experiences. This means instead of boosting salary, boost their exciting opportunities. They want to build relationships, take on a driving force in innovative projects, and interact with customers or other employee teams, depending on the nature of your business.</p><h3> <strong>  What Your Training Needs to Look Like </strong></h3><p> <br/> A few online courses every other month or so isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. Leadership training for this group needs to be embedded into your cultural values. Specifically, the training should take a two-pronged approach: experience-based and individualized.</p><p> Gen Y respondents to the Virtuali study reported that they thought the leadership training was inadequate, and that it placed too much emphasis on e-learning instead of on actual on-the-job experiences. Look back at what these young employees think leadership means and attack training from that perspective. There should be job rotations, shadowing, externships, special job assignments, and helming new projects.</p><p> In the modern era, millennials are used to having things tailored to their needs. Leadership training should be the same. Focus on each employee&rsquo;s strengths and cater to them when assigning projects and job rotations.</p><h3> <strong>  The Most Valued Leadership Training for Gen Y </strong></h3><p> <br/> Remember how this generation values experiences? Make these experiences something to write home about &mdash; literally. One of the most highly sought-after opportunities for them is the opportunity to work abroad. Global business environments should capitalize on this to engage future leaders of their company.</p><p> In the Virtuali study, 87% of millennial respondents reported that the opportunity to work abroad would increase their desire to join a company, 80% would be highly engaged, and 81% said it would make them want to remain at their company. Don&rsquo;t miss out on this opportunity if it&rsquo;s available to your company.</p><p> This generation is the future of companies. Invest in their leadership training with on-the-job experiences and you&rsquo;ll win their loyalty.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There is no clear and precise answer to the question, \"to buy long-term care insurance or not.\" Naturally, different situations call for different solutions. The long-term care insurance inquiry is full of pros and cons and a slew of other ancillary concerns. In the future, I'll address other critical topics that deal with long-term care since 70 percent of older Americans will need at least three years of it after turning 65. <strong>  And since the cost of a nursing home stay runs close to $85,500 a year, aging Americans need all the information they can get. </strong></p><h3> <strong>  Why Long-Term Care Insurance? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The reason anyone needs a policy is to get help paying for nursing home care or assistance doing everyday tasks like bathing, using the bathroom, preparing meals, shopping, and taking medications. This type of care is very costly. Check out  <a href=\"http://www.skillednursingfacilities.org/resources/nursing-home-costs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  senior care costs in your area </a> .</p><p> The biggest problem with long-term care insurance policies, you must buy it in advance. If you wait till you need it, you won't qualify. Another issue, people have a hard time figuring out the type of care they might need in the future. You frankly don't know how your health will play out.</p><p> Health is not something to gamble with and to tackle the threat of possible devastating care cost is a significant challenge. And while long-term care insurance may not solve all the care problems for everyone, you need a strategy to deal with the hefty costs of the expenses.</p><p> People need senior care for two reasons; they're in poor health, and they cannot take care of themselves, and secondly, they don't have access to nearby friends or family to help out.</p><p> Chronic conditions like dementia, advanced osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's require long-term care and the illnesses require high-cost care facilities. Since these types of diseases develop over time, it's difficult to know precisely the kinds of care a person living with the illness will require.</p><h3> <strong>  Families no Longer Care for Elderly </strong></h3><p> <br/> You may remember how the family cared for grandparents years ago. Each family member pitched in. I recall my mom sharing the care with her sisters. Each would take a day to cook and help grandma out. But today, families live at a far distance from one another. Several years ago, the National Alliance for Caregiving found that 20 percent of the family caregivers have their elderly recipients at home with them. For the rest of the elderly, the only solution is a nursing home facility.</p><p> As you learned in the last two articles on Aging matters, Medicare does not pay for long-term custodial care that supports activities of daily living. And Medicaid may cover the expenses for those who meet its financial requirements, but benefits are difficult to obtain.</p>",

    "content": "<p> I recently posted about a landmark survey by The Economist Intelligence Unit, which well and truly puts to bed the idea that social media is merely a 'passing fad' and not worth marketers putting their efforts into.</p><p> The EIU report, 'The path to 2020: Marketers seize the customer experience,' questioned 499 CMOs and senior-level marketers from all over the world, gathering their thoughts on the trends and technologies that are most likely to impact the marketing industry over the next five years.</p><p> Of all the findings in the report, the one that really stood out for me was the fact that most of these experts predict that social media will be an even more important marketing channel than the Web by 2020!</p><p>  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,h_3000,w_1200/v1/75010/CfhVLtvWcAQQc_L_fytyem.jpg\"/></p><p> When asked which three channels they thought customers would expect them to deliver marketing messages through in 2020, the majority (63%) of respondents placed social media right at the top of the ladder. This was followed by the web (53%), mobile apps (47%) the mobile web (46%) and email (36%).</p><p> Traditional channels didn't fare anything like as well in the survey, with direct mail, television and print garnering a respective 17%, 15% and 14% of respondents.</p><p> One of the main reasons for this shift, the report explains, is that over the past few years marketers have been improving their ability to understand how personalisation drives engagement and, as a result, sales. Between now and 2020, they will be further honing their personalisation efforts and gaining a deeper understanding of how context can help deliver timely, relevant content that will be of value to customers.</p><p> It is significant that the top three channels lend themselves to a high degree of personalisation, interaction and engagement, while more traditional marketing channels tend to be more focused on &lsquo;push&rsquo; publishing.</p><p> As the report explains, while, up until now, data has been used to record what happens in the customer/brand relationship, social media - along with smartphones - is giving brands the power to actually \"make things happen in that relationship.\" Having become an extension of ourselves and the way we communicate and interact with the world, these technologies continue to go from strength to strength. So businesses of all shapes and sizes - whether B2C or B2B - need to ensure they&rsquo;re positioned for the new marketing reality.</p><p> Having an effective social media marketing strategy is no longer just a question of keeping up one step ahead of the corporate Joneses. With every passing year it&rsquo;s becoming more and more integral to business success. And if the world&rsquo;s top marketers are to be believed, by 2020 a business without a social media strategy will be every bit as anomalous as one without a web strategy today.</p>",

    "content": "<p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3058731/7-essential-lessons-from-the-harvard-innovation-lab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   This interesting article  </a> </u>  describes a few lessons on how students learn to create an environment where innovation thrives. Being intellectually curious is crucial in that perspective. Exploring for the information you need and connecting with people who can guide you in learning essential skills is important. This doesn&rsquo;t only apply to being innovative, also to being a leader. What are the values and behaviours of leaders who are responsible for big innovations that disrupt?</p><p> In the article Jodi Goldstein, the head of  <u>  <a href=\"https://i-lab.harvard.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard Innovation Lab (I-lab)  </a> </u> , sums up seven essentials:</p><li> Be a sponge</li><li> Narrow is a good place to start</li><li> Competition is good</li><li> Ideas are great, but execution is what matters</li><li> Spend time from people who are different from you</li><li> Getting better is messy</li><li> Innovation isn&rsquo;t lightening, it&rsquo;s simmering <br/>  </li><p> All true. In a  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/leiderschap/contract-management-the-revolutionary-pivot-of-brand-ecosystems-and-partnerships/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   recent article  </a> </u>  I explained my insights on how current developments drive change, like longevity, new media, the computational world, global connection, social tools and smart machines and systems. Most of these developments hold and require a high degree of innovative thinking. In order to become as agile as the continuous change, creating an environment that empowers innovation will help you to enter the new era. An era that will be marked by technology, sustainability and shareability. It is the inevitable next level in business. Think big, start small and act fast. For that you need leadership. Leaders that enable people to  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.arjenvanberkum.nl/leiderschap/this-technology-era-needs-leaders-that-fail/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   try, learn, fail, so they can grow  </a> </u>  are indispensable when you want to unleash innovation. When you compare skills for innovation and leadership, they are not so far apart. Let&rsquo;s look at the main leadership skills.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Curiosity: leaders have fun in learning new things. </strong></h3><p> They let learning be a core part of their day-to-day living pattern. They challenge themselves to go outside their own field. They are always eager to search the internet, take classes, read books, attend presentations and engage in dialogues. Learning leads them to the right track.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Tenacity: Leaders don&rsquo;t give up. </strong></h3><p> They are on a mission, and always find another way. They are a master in the art of convincing people that their idea is smart and holds great added value. In that perspective, they surround themselves by people who will challenge them if they wander off down the lane of stubbornness.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Courage: Leaders are not fearlessness. </strong></h3><p> They are willing to act even when fear is around the corner. There&rsquo;s a difference, for the greater good. They aren&rsquo;t afraid of exposing themselves to lack of knowledge. The answers they&rsquo;ll get and the feedback they will receive, will mostly bring them new ideas.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Humility: Leaders, although being self-confident, are very humble. </strong></h3><p> Admitting to not knowing and not being able to be the best in everything is one of the things they can do graciously. That&rsquo;s why they persistently seek to learn as much as they can: they will never be done. There&rsquo;s no growing-up, only growing. Therefore they gather people around them who remind them and challenge them when they are on the verge of getting stuck.</p><p> Are you an innovator or a leader?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Financial advisors should establish a process for analyzing the differences between ETFs and evaluating the potential benefits and risks of each ETF.</h3><p> <br/> An advisor&rsquo;s objective should be to match the philosophy and structure of a given ETF with client needs. It is important to look at the structure of the ETF, review its underlying index and understand the philosophy of the investment manager. When creating a customized due diligence process, take care to avoid common misconceptions by considering the following:</p><li> Underlying investments are more important than size</li><li> A focus on track record length may obscure critical details; and</li><li> Explicit costs, implicit costs and opportunity costs should be considered when determining the costs of investing in an ETF. <br/>  </li><p> Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are an integral part of many portfolios, valued by financial advisors and investors alike for their liquidity, transparency and tax efficiency. In recent years, their popularity has soared, fueled by financial advisors who were transforming their businesses to meet investors&rsquo; changing needs. As clients asked for assistance with complex wealth management challenges, financial advisors sought potent, flexible investment strategies that would help them solve clients&rsquo; problems.</p><p> According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2014 there were 1,411 exchange traded funds domiciled in the United States, holding nearly $2 trillion in net assets. That&rsquo;s up from $228 billion just 10 years ago.* Along with their explosive growth, however, ETFs evolved in complexity, structure and usage. Unfortunately for many advisors, their due diligence process vis-a-vis ETFs did not. Too often, they employed the same tools used to evaluate mutual fund and separate account strategies, meaning potentially that they may have been asking the wrong questions.</p><h3> We believe that financial advisors should establish a customized due diligence process &ndash; one that is structured and deliberate in nature.</h3><p> <br/> This process should recognize the differences between ETFs and evaluate the potential benefits and risks of each ETF. An advisor&rsquo;s objective should be to match the philosophy and structure of a given ETF with client needs. </p><p> Four vital questions are at the heart of this process:</p><li> Does the ETF achieve its objective?</li><li> Can investors access it at a fair price?</li><li> Does it give the targeted exposure?</li><li> Does it align with the real world goals? <br/>  </li><p> To answer these questions, advisors must look at the structure of the ETF, understand its underlying index and understand the investment manager.</p><h3> <strong>  STEP ONE: EXAMINE THE STRUCTURE </strong></h3><p> <br/> Advisors should examine the structure of an individual ETF, such as its investment program, tax consequences, custodial policies and other nuances that could impact its effectiveness.</p><h3> <strong>  STEP TWO: UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING INDEX </strong></h3><p> <br/> When it comes to choosing an index, advisors should start by asking what it would take to &ldquo;invest with purpose.&rdquo;</p><li> Is the investment objective more important than just beating the benchmark?</li><li> Does the index align with the advisor&rsquo;s investment thesis and the client&rsquo;s desired outcome?</li><li> Is the index investable, or does it include holdings that cannot be accessed directly? <br/>  </li><h3> Advisors should make sure their understanding is clear.</h3><p> <br/> The index must be measurable, appropriate and reflective of current investment options. For equities, determine if it has the desired capitalization weighting, return variance, style, country, sector or manager risk. For fixed income, establish whether the strategy delivers the desired asset class exposure, risk and yield. Advisors should also evaluate the potential challenges and the benefits of beta, alternative-weighted or actively managed indexes.</p><h3> <strong>  STEP THREE: UNDERSTAND THE INVESTMENT MANAGER </strong></h3><p> <br/> Before selecting an ETF, an advisor should get to know the investment manager &ndash; the firm&rsquo;s professionals, process, philosophy and performance. Firm philosophies on product development, experience and expertise can vary greatly. In reviewing the prospectus, especially for an active strategy, examine the manager&rsquo;s investment process.</p><li> Can it employ inverse and leverage strategies?</li><li> Can it use derivatives as part of the investment process, and if so, does the manager use them for risk management or to take bets?</li><li> Can the ETF contain swaps by structure? <br/>  </li><p> Additionally, is the ETF created in-kind or with cash? This could have a financial impact on the client&rsquo;s portfolio.</p><p> More broadly speaking, financial advisors should get to know the investment manager by examining the following.</p><li> Depth of investment expertise</li><li> Strategies used to manage tax consequences</li><li> Management of turnover</li><li> Handling of transaction costs</li><li> Tactics used to deal with tracking error</li><li> Use of optimization, replication or representative sampling</li><li> Fiduciary experience</li><li> Philosophy <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  BE SKEPTICAL </strong></h3><p> <br/> In creating a customized due diligence process, advisors must take care to avoid some of the most common misconceptions. Following are three key considerations.</p><h3> <strong>  Underlying Investments are More Important than Size </strong></h3><p> <br/> The investments held within an ETF will determine that ETF&rsquo;s pricing and liquidity. Contrary to popular belief, the size of an ETF has little or no relevance to how it will trade. In reality, an ETF trades based on supply and demand in the market for the underlying investments. For example, an investor could have difficulty selling a steel ETF because the price of steel is falling, not because of the size or viability of the steel ETF itself.</p><h3> <strong>  A Focus on Track Record Length May Obscure Critical Details </strong></h3><p> <br/> We don&rsquo;t think advisors need to see a long track record for every type of ETF. In some cases, they should give more weight to the manager&rsquo;s investment thesis. With newer strategies &ndash; for instance, tilted or alternatively weighted indexes &ndash; advisors should decide if they believe in the manager&rsquo;s investment thesis. Does the manager have a distinct, logical investment approach that can generate the desired outcome? Analytics can be useful in making this determination.</p><p> Furthermore, different underlying indexes require different levels of &ldquo;proof.&rdquo; A rules-based beta product, such as an S&amp;P 500 Index ETF, fully replicates the index, and investors get what the market gives them. On the other hand, when advisors are considering an ETF benchmarked to the Estonian bond market, they may need to see a substantial track record. Unknown factors could have an impact on such an ETF and as a result, the strategy is likely to require a high level of skill to manage.</p><p> Reconsider the Math of ETF Ownership Cost Many financial advisors use the same industry-standard equation for ETFs that is used to determine the cost of a pure beta mutual fund:</p><p> <strong>  Expense Ratio  <br/>  + Trading Spread  <br/>  <u>   + Tracking Error                     </u>  <br/>  = Total Cost of Ownership </strong></p><p> This equation falls short, however. In reality, there are many different cost considerations when investing in an ETF.</p><h3> <strong>  Explicit Costs. </strong></h3><p> <br/> These are the most commonly cited costs in comparative articles or reviews. They include expense ratio, commission and bid/ask spread, all of which are readily identifiable and easy to discuss and understand.</p><h3> <strong>  Implicit Costs. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Unlike explicit costs that can be researched across many data sources, implicit costs can be harder to quantify. While they may require more effort to unearth, implicit costs are just as important as their explicit counterparts. Implicit costs include capital gains, turnover within the fund, the funds tracking success against its index (or a standard market benchmark) and distribution or platform fees.</p><p> It is important to understand that these costs are not independent of one another; sometimes lowering an explicit cost can increase implicit costs or even reduce the effectiveness of the investment strategy. </p><h3> <strong>  Opportunity Costs. </strong></h3><p> <br/> As the ETF product landscape continues to evolve, interest in alternative index weighting methodologies has grown rapidly, particularly in the last several years. Use of these so-called &ldquo;nontraditionally weighted&rdquo; indices offers another perspective on costs: the opportunity cost &mdash; and the choice of one product over another dictates opportunity cost.</p><p> For an in-depth discussion of these three basic categories of ETF purchasing costs, we urge you to review our paper, &ldquo;The Total Cost of ETF Ownership, An Important &mdash; but Complex &mdash; Calculation.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  ONCE PROCESS ESTABLISHED, REVIEW ETFS REGULARLY </strong></h3><p> <br/> In our view, many of the metrics used by financial advisors to evaluate ETFs are obsolete. Rather than assessing ETFs the same way mutual funds are evaluated, advisors should create and implement a customized due diligence process that allows them to match products with what is most appropriate for their clients&rsquo; needs and objectives. To do so, they should seek to understand a fund&rsquo;s construction, methodology and investment philosophy to determine whether it aligns with what they are trying to accomplish. And they should fully understand how to more accurately evaluate the total cost of owning an ETF. We recommend establishing a regular review process to verify that the ETFs in your clients&rsquo; portfolios are continuing to meet their needs and have the stability to weather change and uncertainty.</p><h3> <strong>  For more information contact FlexShares at 1-855-FlexETF (1-855-353-9383) or visit us  <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-etf-due-diligence-post-40416\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   <u>    here   </u>  </a>  . </strong> <br/>  </h3>* 2015 Investment Company Institute Fact Book",

    "title": "Micromanagement: The Engagement Killer",
    "link": "micromanagement-the-engagement-killer",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Employee engagement has hit rock bottom. A recent  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gallup report  </a> </u>  highlighted that 70% of the American workforce is actively disengaged. Having these employees is detrimental to the success of the company, as shown by the  <u>  <a href=\"/category/grow/leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   $720 million  </a> </u>  spent by companies trying to remedy this already pertinent problem. Actively disengaged employees are those who don't want to be there, but rather see work as a necessity. They see it as a means to an end, as a way of simply earning money. One of the main reasons for this active disengagement is the process of Micromanagement. When employees are micromanaged, it kills professional development, as employees feel that whatever task they are assigned to is scrutinised, regardless of their output.</p><h3> Micromanagement is the process whereby a manager virtually takes over the role the employee is employed to do.</h3>This leads to productivity issues and can drastically lower employee morale. Paying attention to the details and making sure the work is getting done is important, however learning to trust the employees who are hired to take on certain responsibilities is even more important to the long term success of the business. Micromanagement may result in short term results, but in the long run it only serves to the detriment of the manager in question.Managers who tend to micromanage, dilute their own productivity and often lack the capacity to get the things managers should be focusing on, done. What&rsquo;s more, the process of micromanagement stunts any form of employee development and creates an environment where employees rely heavily on the presence of their managers. When this occurs, it tends to go one of two ways. Those team members with the big idea, quality skills and knowledge will remove themselves from any micromanagement  situation, while those on the other side of the coin will become office deadweights. Waiting for the manager to tell them what to do.<h3> The workforce then becomes completely void of their own initiative.</h3>A study in the journal of experimental psychology observed that people, who believed they were being watched, performed at a lower level than those who weren&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s more, another study found that highly educated employees work more when given autonomy over their own work. When employees are pressured by their managers to work more, they feel less inspired. However, when they are allowed to set their their own goals with their manager, they often accept the workload because it's their choice.Leaders must learn how to give autonomy and accountability effectively in order to get the most out of their employees in the workplace. Accountability doesn't necessary mean delegating tasks and hoping the team member delivers, but rather about trusting the employee with a specific undertaking. Accountability leads to responsibility, which leads to several intrinsic motivators like purpose and accomplishment. When Employees feel they are accomplishing something, they feel valued and engaged in the workplace. A <u> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cywakeman/2015/10/26/personal-accountability-and-the-pursuit-of-workplace-happiness/#2f260d643277\" target=\"_blank\">  Forbes </a></u> article outlined some of the benefits to creating accountability. By having employees that possess professional accountability in the workplace it led them to feeling more committed to their work, more resilient to roadblocks, and encouraged them to continuously learn and improve. The key to accountability is to passively track work without micromanaging. Creating accountability is about creating a culture where people value responsibility and trust.<h3> So how do you make your teams more accountable?</h3><h3> 1. Set clear expectations</h3>At the beginning of the month, discuss exactly what the employee is required to do. This is the core of holding teams accountable. Setting clear, measurable goals makes it unambiguous about what is expected and opens up a dialogue of communication. By setting goals with the employee, the person gets to understand why they are to complete specific goals, and gives them a sense of control over how to go about achieving these goals. By using systems such as SMART goals and Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). At Impraise, we encourage the use of goals so employees know and understand how to be as productive as possible, without the constant oversight by their manager.<h3> 2. Clearly communicate what accountability is</h3>During meetings, or one on ones with each team member, clearly explain what accountability means and what you, as a manager, expect. If you feel that the employee is not taking accountability seriously enough, give them feedback about it. Tell them where you think they should improve, and give them the steps on how to go about it. Opening up the channels of communication allows you to build trust and rapport with your teammates<h3> 3. Clearly define a plan</h3>Outline the actions and steps required to get to the end goal. A great way to build on your expectations is to make sure the employee is part of the process and there is clarity on how to achieve their goals. Using impraise, set up performance reviews, so you can easily correct for the next steps. By implementing a planning structure, employees know and understand how to get to a specific goal, without the manager having to micromanage the whole process. This allows you to free up some time to get the more important things done.As seen in the above article, micromanagement can kill motivation and lead to disengagement in the workplace. It&rsquo;s important to clearly communicate to the managers or team leaders within the organisation how to delegate effectively. Impraise gives managers and employees the opportunity to express feedback whenever they feel they need it the most. When an employee can easily express how they feel toward their managers, it fosters a collaborative and engaged workforce because employees feel trusted and heard. This two way conversation allows employees and managers to focus on other areas of the business, which then leads to longer business success.",

    "link": "the-secret-to-successful-content-marketing",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As I&rsquo;ve been working with my clients for some time now and growing my own business with a full and healthy pipeline of more opportunity, it&rsquo;s evident what makes a successful content marketing strategy. Fortunately, most brands now see the value and the benefit of this thing called content marketing. Most brands like the idea of creating original, personalized content and reaching their audiences organically. Though while everyone is opting for more content creation, there is a big secret to successful content marketing.</p><h3> In all honesty, there are a few secrets to successful content marketing, but perhaps one of the most underplayed is: Patience.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, patience. Patience because without it, you will never get to the point where all your wonderful work starts creating more opportunity for you. Patience because any good and sticky relationship takes time to develop and evolve. Patience because if it was easy, everyone would be successful. Patience because a true content marketing strategy takes a good six months to establish the right rhythm and cadence with your target audience; a good nine months before a steady stream of qualified potential clients come to your website to take action; a good year before your content marketing program is humming along with a solid foundation and the ability for you to add new and more engaging opportunities to connect and increase your value to your audience.</p><p> Here are the reasons why you need patience when it comes to content marketing and why it is worth all the effort:</p><h3> <strong>  A good content marketing strategy needs time to play out </strong></h3><p> <br/> Of course it does! First, it&rsquo;s critical that you have a documented content marketing strategy. Even a bad strategy is better than no strategy at all, because at least then you know that it&rsquo;s not working and can adjust. A solid content marketing strategy is going to include:</p><li> why you need a content strategy</li><li> your overall business goals and what, specifically, content marketing&rsquo;s role will be in helping to support those goals</li><li> deep and thoughtful audience discovery</li><li> your brand story and voice guide to inform what types of content and how it will be communicated</li><li> team roles and responsibilities &ndash; because a content program can take a village</li><li> distribution channels &ndash; where your content and messages will go to start conversations</li><li> and key performance indicators &ndash; how and what you will measure in order to track progress <br/>  </li><p> Once you have all this documented and start executing, here is why patience is so important. You won&rsquo;t see instant results. Just like after you plant flowers or grass seed, you won&rsquo;t see it actively growing. You just leave your house one day and it has grown into exactly what you expected. Your content strategy works much in the same way: little by little seeds are planted and carefully nurtured over time until healthy and positive results abound.</p><h3> <strong>  Quality content isn&rsquo;t quickly created </strong></h3><p> <br/> Another area you need patience in content marketing is in your ability to produce quality content. Quality content is more important than quantity and quality content that is created with your specific audience in mind takes time to:</p><li> understand your audience: who they are, what they value, what their challenges are, their behaviors and how they acquire information</li><li> understand your value to your audience: how you solve their problem and add value where they need it most</li><li> craft content that serves a purpose &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s to educate, entertain or simply to just connect <br/>  </li><p> If you&rsquo;re outsourcing content creation, make sure that you select a person or agency that takes the time to create custom content with you and is going to take the time to adopt your voice and involve you in the process. Because content creation is time consuming, this is a common area to delegate, but when you look at content like a conversation, you understand why your subject matter expertise and manner of speaking is so important to come across in your written content. If you hire a writer or content marketer, make yourself available for interviews or create audio files with your thoughts on the upcoming blog post topics. The more a writer hears you speak, the better they will be in authentically representing you.</p><p> Crafting a healthy supply of quality content requires patience, because there is no easy way to fast-track the creation process and, honestly, it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it. Instead, stick to your content plan, craft content as you have time and budget to do so, and allow yourself the freedom to patiently let your content program build up.</p><h3> <strong>  Valuable relationships aren&rsquo;t forged in a day </strong></h3><p> <br/> As someone in a client-centric business, you probably know better than most that the best relationships take time to develop. Building trust with your clients happens one day at a time and you can&rsquo;t demand it. Instead, you consistently show, over time with your actions, that you are trustworthy. Content marketing works the same exact way to build trust.</p><p> Because of technology and the way people search for information and research possible solutions, your online presence is an opportunity to meet your prospective clients where they are and add value to them immediately. When someone Google&rsquo;s your name or firm, what shows up? Nothing? A complaint? An attractive and useful website? Valuable, original articles created by you? When someone Google&rsquo;s a question or a problem you help your clients with, are you there? It takes time to establish trust between you and your audience and it takes time to even build trust with search engines.</p><p> In service-based industries, treat content creation like an extension of your client service. You are a trusted resource to your clients and content can help you start that same relationship with prospective clients as well. Patience is the key to helping you get there.</p><p> Even as a content marketing strategist, it took my content marketing program a full year to build up and really work to grow my business. I had to adjust my content strategy, overcome a few setbacks, and exercise the same patience I encourage of you.  It&rsquo;s worth it. Content marketing, when done right, attracts the clients you want most, adds value to your client and prospective client relationships, and makes it possible for even more opportunities to find you.</p><p> Start small. Start big. Just be sure to start and have patience!</p>",

    "link": "4-tips-for-becoming-a-more-balanced-leader",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The standards you set for yourself, as a leader, will either result in leadership that is balanced, or leadership that is ineffective and awkward.</p><p> Employees can quickly see through false motives and inauthentic behavior.</p><p> Here are four tips for becoming a more balanced leader.</p><h3> 1. Confidence vs. humility <br/>  </h3><p> As a leader, you must find a balance between confidence and humility. Employees need to know they are following a competent leader, one who can stand with confidence in the face of challenges. On the other hand, they will never be inspired by arrogance. Balanced leadership requires you to show humility, that you do not see yourself as better than, or as more worthy than your employees while still being confident.</p><h3> 2. Trust vs. distrust <br/>  </h3><p> As a leader, you must develop mutually trusting relationships. Employees must know you trust their ability to complete tasks in their own way and make decisions. They must also know that they can trust you to look out for their best interests. Distrust, whether perceived or real, on the part of either party corrodes relationships, teams, morale, and the ability to influence. Balanced leadership requires you to manage not only the relationships you build, but also employees&rsquo; perceptions of trust.</p><h3> 3. Curiosity vs. judgment <br/>  </h3><p> No one individual knows everything. As a leader, you must learn to be curious. What do your employees know that you don&rsquo;t? What are you missing when you look at a situation or try to resolve a problem? When you judge you are letting your ego stand in the way of being open to the idea that you might not know everything. Stop assuming you have all the answers and encourage your employees to help you see the world through the lens of their experiences and knowledge. Balanced leadership requires you to have the ability to make judgment calls when necessary but to remain open and curious about what you might not know.</p><h3> 4. You vs. them <br/>  </h3><p> The most important thing for you to remember, as a leader, is that it&rsquo;s not about you. It&rsquo;s about the relationships and partnerships you develop with employees, clients, and vendors. These relationships are based, not on you, but on focusing on them as individuals. Brag about your people; make them the heroes of the story. Balanced leadership requires you to recognize the responsibility that falls on you, but to also know that your leadership focus is not about you, but about those you lead and collaborate with.</p><h3> Balanced Leadership <br/>  </h3><p> Balanced leadership requires that you balance much needed confidence with the humility that allows you to inspire others. It&rsquo;s about developing trust while eliminating even the perception of distrust. It requires embracing curiosity while limiting judgment in situations where employees may have more knowledge than you. And, most of all, it&rsquo;s about putting the focus on those you lead instead of yourself. Take the time to evaluate your leadership and work on becoming a more balanced leader.</p>",

    "content": "<p> &ldquo;Will my clients follow me?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;How deep are my relationships?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Do I have the confidence to test their loyalty to me?&rdquo; <br/> &ldquo;Do I want ALL of my clients to follow, or is this a good time to clean house?&rdquo;</p><p> These are the questions that keep anyone who is thinking of changing firms up at night. And, they are the right ones. After all, spending a professional lifetime building and nurturing relationships, the last thing an advisor wants is to lose ground&mdash;especially since the motivation, presumably, for any move should be to improve the client service model and accelerate growth. </p><p> So, how should someone in exploration mode assess the wisdom of changing jerseys?</p><h3> Consider these five steps: <br/>  </h3><li> Objectively evaluate your book client-by-client. Break it down into three lists, A&rsquo;s, B&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s. A&rsquo;s are for the ones that you know are yours for life. B&rsquo;s are for the questionable ones&mdash;likely to follow you anywhere, but not 100% sure. C&rsquo;s are definitively up for grabs. If the A&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t far outweigh the B&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s, then perhaps staying put is your best bet.</li><li> Evaluate the genesis of each relationship: Were they inherited and, therefore, not really &ldquo;yours&rdquo; or have they been self-generated?  How &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; are the assets to your firm/bank?</li><li> Create your elevator pitch: Imagine that you have made the move to a new firm and you now need to tell your clients why they should follow you. What would you say? What&rsquo;s in it for them? Does the new firm&rsquo;s value proposition sound like one that your clients could legitimately embrace?</li><li> Would you be ok with the loss of some clients? In every move that I have ever facilitated, there has been at least a small amount of &ldquo;slippage&rdquo;. It isn&rsquo;t possible to put your book up for bid and not lose at least one or two clients. Could you live with that? Do you believe that this new opportunity will allow you to do better work for your clients overall and grow faster? If so, does the upside outweigh the potential downside?</li><li> Are you considering a move for the right reasons? No doubt, personal financial gain, both short- and long-term, is a great motivator. But unless you are certain that, at the heart of it, you are moving with your clients&rsquo; best interests at heart, I believe verily that you are better off staying put. <br/>  </li><p> While every advisor who has ever changed firms admits to feeling apprehensive about client portability until those ACAT&rsquo;s started rolling in, it is heartening to know that most quality advisors changing firms for the RIGHT reasons move the overwhelming majority of their assets within the first two months, and generally hit 100% of their recruited assets by month nine.</p><p> Broker Protocol &ndash; the seminal document that allows an advisor to move with impunity as long as he doesn&rsquo;t violate it &ndash; has been the real game changer. Plus, almost every quality firm has a dedicated transition team that has transformed the process from art to science. And we have seen advisors breaking away from the traditional space and going independent who have gotten back to 100% of their asset base within six months and to more than 110% of original assets within a year.</p><p> Changing firms is most often viewed as an opportunity for reinvention and, as such, a chance to pare one&rsquo;s book and jettison client relationships that are less profitable, productive or emotionally fulfilling. Still, plenty of folks are held captive by the worry that their clients are theirs only because of their association with their current firm. In some cases, this could be very true but, in many, I think that advisors sell themselves short when they allow fear to rule them&mdash;especially when the potential upside could far outweigh any loss.</p><p> In the end, clients will stay with who they are comfortable with. Use the time before a move to ensure you&rsquo;ve properly prepared and solidified relationships and you&rsquo;ll find that the right clients will follow&mdash;along with the success you seek.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> If you&rsquo;ve arrived at a place in your marriage where you&rsquo;re certain continuing is just not possible, then it&rsquo;s time to do some preparation&mdash;the key to safely navigating this life transition. <br/>  </h3><p> Emotions typically take center stage when a relationship has deteriorated beyond repair&mdash;and it&rsquo;s safe to say that good financial decision-making and emotions rarely mix well. So while it&rsquo;s challenging to deal with money issues rationally when you&rsquo;re blanketed in pain, you want to give it your best shot.</p><p> There are several options to dissolve your marriage. Some couples (usually seething with anger and hurt), seek to hire the toughest and most aggressive &ldquo;shark&rdquo; attorney who will look to pound their adversary into pulp. The attorneys proceed to slug it out with letters, court orders and threats. Meanwhile their billing clocks are running and fees pile up astronomically faster than you might imagine possible. At the end of this lengthy and expensive process, their private lives are laid open to public scrutiny. While thismight be the only recourse, it should probably not be your first.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s say that more sensible heads prevail and each party decides that the best possible outcome is not punishment, but the preservation of as much wealth as possible.</p><p> In this case, there are better and more rational approaches available, such as: mediation or collaborative divorce. </p><h3> Mediation <br/>  </h3><p> A sensible&mdash;and in the long run financially healthy&mdash;way to go is to seek the aid of a qualified Divorce Mediator who can help you and your soon to be ex-spouse decide on a fair and agreeable arrangement. The mediator is an unbiased neutral third party who lines up the issues to be discussed and helps guide the discussion and process.  The main areas of discussion are:</p><li> Child custody issues</li><li> Property distribution</li><li> Child support</li><li> Alimony</li><li> Taxes</li><li> Retirement <br/>  </li><p> Not only is the process far less costly than going the litigation route, the typical time frame is much shorter. Other benefits include privacy of both parties as they come to agreement on the terms of the divorce.</p><h3> Collaborative Divorce</h3><p> <br/> Another option gaining popularity is called collaborative divorce. In a collaborative divorce, each party hires their own counsel who advises and assists in negotiating the settlement. It is common for experts to be brought into the conversation, such as social workers, child custody specialists and neutral accountants.</p><p> This option can help:</p><li> Stabilize difficult situations through a temporary agreement.</li><li> Make the exchange of all necessary information voluntarily.</li><li> The parties agree on legal procedures to keep costs down and speed up the process.</li><li> Negotiate the settlement that works for each party.</li><li> Create a process for post-divorce decisions. <br/>  </li><p> The collaborative divorce process is one where you and your spouse negotiate an acceptable agreement with some professional guidance and support. Each spouse hires a specially trained collaborative attorney who will assist in negotiating a settlement agreement.</p><p> In choosing mediation or a collaborative solution vs. the standard litigation process, you are choosing a more dignified, private and less costly method to move your life to the next stage. With all the hurt and pain surrounded by this transition period, winding up with more money in your pocket to begin your new life sounds like a better and more secure way to go.</p>",

My grueling schedule had nothing to do with poor organizational skills; instead, it reflected the way I thought about the tasks before me.</p><p> I needed to become a mentally tough leader to overcome the psychological obstacles that prevented me from getting more organized with my time.</p><p> Taking control of your emotions, thoughts, and behavior takes mental toughness because you need to be very intentional about how you overcome the mental obstacles that slow you down.</p><p> Leaders, entrepreneurs, and business owners have a lot to get done&mdash;and only 24 hours in the day in which to do it!</p><p> Here are 4 ways you can be mentally tough and get organized:</p><h3> <strong>  1. MENTALLY TOUGH LEADERS ADMIT PROCRASTINATION TRAITS </strong></h3><p> <br/> We tend to shrink from specific tasks for several reasons but there is nothing you can do about it until you become aware of why you are procrastinating. Ask yourself, &ldquo;Why do I keep not wanting to do this?&rdquo;</p><p> Perhaps for one of these reasons:</p><li> Overcoming the learning curve is daunting if it&rsquo;s a new project</li><li> Fear of making a poor decision</li><li> Expectations of perfection</li><li> Boredom for the task has set in&mdash;this one will sink you. If you&rsquo;re bored with your task, it&rsquo;s time to be honest about how you can change either your attitude or your assignment. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  BOTTOM LINE: </strong>   Stop blaming distractions and drill down to uncover the real emotional obstacle that is slowing you down.</p><h3> <strong>  2. MENTALLY TOUGH LEADERS STOP FOCUSING ON TOO MUCH PROGRESS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Leaders, entrepreneurs, and business owners need to spend an inordinate amount of time mulling over strategy and future steps. This type of thinking is open-ended and involves uncertainty&mdash;this is your most important work.</p><p> But, many times we get bogged down in relatively unimportant work&mdash;stuff that needs to get done but doesn&rsquo;t move the needle toward where you are headed.</p><p> Once you realize that 1) you engage in both types of work, and 2) both are necessary, it&rsquo;s easier to grasp why some types of work trigger bigger returns than others. When you do, it changes the way you think about how to organize your day.</p><p> The important work is what will take you to the next level of performance; the unimportant work will keep you right where you are.</p><p> Both have their place in our daily routine. Unimportant work leaves us satisfied&mdash;we&rsquo;ve accomplished something and crossed an item off our to-do list. Important work, however, makes us happier.</p><p> We are happier when we&rsquo;re focused and immersed in something that provides with value and meaning. According to Daniel Gilbert, author of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert-ebook/dp/B000GCFW0A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449086762&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=daniel+gilbert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Stumbling On Happiness  </a> </u> , a wandering mind is not a happy mind.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B000W94FE6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449086820&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flow+mihaly+csikszentmihalyi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi  </a> </u>  contends that the concept of flow happens when we are engaged in important work that is very satisfying and our attention is focused on something that is good and concrete. We enter a state where we&rsquo;re giving full and rapt attention to something that we&rsquo;re good at and is important to us.</p><p> <strong>  BOTTOM LINE: </strong> Schedule time for your important work in each day of your week.</p><h3> <strong>  3. MENTALLY TOUGH LEADERS NIP MONKEY MIND IN THE BUD </strong></h3><p> <br/> Mentally tough leaders do not ignore noise and distractions&mdash;that is impossible! But they can control their restless and unsettled &ldquo;monkey mind&rdquo; by quieting it as soon as they recognize it.</p><p> This is a basic premise of mental toughness: If we are aware of what we are thinking, we can chose our behavior.</p><p> Meditation takes a mentally tough mind because it is constantly saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to intrusive thoughts and emotions.</p><p> <strong>  BOTTOM LINE: </strong> Identify and eliminate those behaviors and thoughts that mess up your schedule. Conduct a review of how your monkey mind sabotaged your day. The error is not messing up; the error is not fixing it so that you don&rsquo;t mess up next time.</p><h3> <strong>  4. MENTALLY TOUGH LEADERS AVOID PEOPLE WHO KIDNAP THEIR TIME </strong></h3><p> <br/> I learned to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to people who had nothing better to do than sit around and talk. As Warren Buffett said, &ldquo;The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to almost everything.&rdquo;</p><p> I came to work every day focused on what was important for me to accomplish that day.</p><p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely\" target=\"_blank\">  Dan Ariely </a>  aptly points out that saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; feels bad and hard because humans are social creatures. Most of us want to be nice and a team player.</p><p> <strong>  BOTTOM LINE: </strong> Guard your time carefully by spending it with people who can help you become the person you want to be. It may feel good to say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but you need to focus on what is important to you.</p><p> How do you organize your day so you can be your most productive?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Ask any manager, V.P. or business owner what one of the biggest challenges they face in making their revenue numbers and they&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;s in identifying, hiring and retaining good sales reps. <br/>  </h3><p> If you are familiar with my management philosophy, then you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about the 80/20 rule in sales, and all you have to do is look at your own company or industry to know it&rsquo;s still true &ndash; 80% of the sales and revenue are made by the Top 20%.</p><p> So how do you identify who the Top 20% are BEFORE you spend all that time and money on hiring, training and then hoping they perform? There are many ways to try to identify the characteristics in advance, and in fact a whole industry of profiling and assessment testing has sprouted up to help you make the right choice. I have used some of these tests and have found them to be quite accurate and valuable.</p><p> I have also found an easier way to identify who the potential top producers are, and I&rsquo;ve boiled it down into three &ldquo;Real Secrets.&rdquo; If you are responsible for identifying and hiring sales reps in your company, then I recommend you use these techniques to help you find the right sales reps before you spend all that time and energy training, managing and hoping you&rsquo;ve made the right choice. </p><h3> Real Secret #1 <br/>  </h3><p> The best predictor of future behavior and performance is past behavior and performance. This is a well known fact in psychology, and it&rsquo;s one you can use to predict how a new sales rep is likely to perform for you. The bottom line is that however much your candidate earned in income in their last job, and the job before that, is mostly likely the amount they are going to earn working for you as well.</p><p> What you must determine is exactly how much money that was. Ask your candidate to provide you with pay stubs or verification of income for the last 6 months, and, in addition, ask them what they earned in income each of the last three years. Find a way to verify this.</p><p> Finally, determine how much of your product or service your candidate would have to sell to generate that kind of income again, and ask yourself if you would be happy with that level of performance &ndash; because that&rsquo;s most likely what you&rsquo;re going to get.</p><h3> Real Secret #2 <br/>  </h3><p> Determine what is really motivating your candidate. What we exposed in the first real secret was your candidate&rsquo;s comfort zone. We all have comfort zones, and sales reps in particular will always live up to &ndash; and most likely down to &ndash; their comfort zone especially in terms of income.</p><p> So if your candidate is really looking to your company and opportunity to better themselves and earn more money, find out what is driving this need and desire for more money. Have their life circumstances changed? For example, have they recently gotten married, had a child, purchased a home? If so, then they may have a real motivation to work harder, make more money and enlarge their comfort zone.</p><p> If their situation hasn&rsquo;t changed, then you can be pretty sure that they will not be motivated to work harder, learn more skills, and make more sales. In essence, they will continue to live down to their current comfort level and you may once again be hiring another 80% producer.</p><h3> Real Secret #3 <br/>  </h3><p> Access their sales skills and previous training. This is one of my favorites. During the interview, I ask my candidates how they think they would do selling my product. They all say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do great!&rdquo; I then do two things:</p><p> 1) I ask them to sell me on the product. What I&rsquo;m looking for is for them to ask me qualifying questions rather than just start pitching. Those who just dive right in and start pitching reveal themselves as middle to low 80% producers. Top 20% producers, on the other hand, start asking me questions and gathering information. They are the ones I&rsquo;m interested in. <br/> 2) Next I give them a couple of objections and watch and listen to how they handle them. You can immediately tell how much training someone has had, and how successful they were, by listening to them handle age old objections like &ldquo;The price is too high,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to talk to someone else first.&rdquo;</p><p> These techniques have saved me hundreds of hours of poor hires, and they have often revealed who the real top producers were. Use them, and you&rsquo;ll love how they will work for you as well.</p>",

    "link": "8-important-money-terms-you-dont-know-but-should",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;ve been following my blog or  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Work-Your-Wealth-Smarter-Choices/dp/0692627332/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   have read my book  </a> </u> , you know how much I dislike fancy financial jargon. Personal finance shouldn&rsquo;t be complicated and both you and I deserve to have a clear understanding of what&rsquo;s happening with our hard earned money.</p><h3> With this in mind and the fact that April is financial literacy month, I&rsquo;m taking pause and breaking down 8 important money terms you may not know (but should).</h3><p> <br/> In digging into these not-so-sexy money terms, you&rsquo;ll find that by understanding these foundational financial topics, you&rsquo;ll only equip yourself to make better financial choices for today and the future.</p><p> Here are some important money terms defined:</p><h3> 1. Asset Allocation</h3><p> <br/> It literally means your money (asset) is being allocated (assigned) to different investment classes within your portfolio: stocks, bonds, cash, and mutual funds. More specifically, asset allocation determines how your assets are distributed within your investment portfolio. It is an investment strategy that adjusts the amounts or percentages you own in certain asset classes to balance risk versus reward based on your overall  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/basic-investing-terms-geny-should-know-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   risk tolerance  </a> </u> , goals and timeframe for holding investments.</p><h3> 2. Net Worth</h3><p> <br/> Your net worth is literally what you own minus what you owe and it&rsquo;s measured in dollars. Taking stock of this number initially gives you a great starting point for measuring your financial health and progress every six to twelve months.  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/know-your-net-worth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Calculating your net worth is simple and you can learn how here  </a> </u> .</p><h3> 3. Compound Interest</h3><p> <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/cost-of-waiting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   This is your money&rsquo;s best friend!  </a> </u>  Compound interest is when you earn interest on the money you invest and then earn interest on that interest. The longer this extra interest you earn on your investment has to grow, the more money your money can earn you over your lifetime.</p><h3> 4. Rule of 72</h3><p> <br/> The rule of 72 is something we financial planners geek out over that helps us estimate how long it will take an investment to double its worth and over what time period. It&rsquo;s a simple mathematical equation by which dividing 72 by the annual rate of return equals how many years it will take for your investment to double.  For example, an investor who invests $1,000 at an interest rate of 6% per year will double their money in 12 years. (72 divided by 6 = 12)..</p><h3> 5. Rate of Return</h3><p> <br/> Rate of return is the profit your investment earns over a particular period of time and can be a positive or a negative number (meaning you&rsquo;re either making money or you&rsquo;re losing it). The return is expressed as a proportion of your original investment over a certain time period (mostly a year, which is why you&rsquo;ll see this number sometimes referred to as an &ldquo;annual rate of return&rdquo;). For example, if you invest $10,000 and it grows to $10,650 over 12 months, you&rsquo;ve earned $650 on your $10,000. Your annual rate of return is: $650 / $10,000 = 6.5%.</p><h3> 6. Diversification</h3><p> <br/> I may or may not compare diversification to the numbers and types of shoes you own in my book,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Work-Your-Wealth-Smarter-Choices/dp/0692627332/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Work Your Wealth  </a> </u> . You&rsquo;re not going to have just one pair of shoes to go with all your outfits. Similarly, you shouldn&rsquo;t have all of your money in just one or two holdings. Having a variety of investment types in your overall portfolio is diversification. It is a popular and recommended investment technique that helps to reduce risk and can provide more stable returns. Think of it this way: If you carry all of your eggs in one basket and you drop the basket, you&rsquo;re out of luck for that awesome brunch you were about to have. If you carried your eggs in multiple baskets however, dropping one basket wouldn&rsquo;t have as big of an impact as you can still rely on the others to help make that omelet!</p><h3> 7. Expense Ratio</h3><p> <br/> This is a fancy term fund managers use that means fees&hellip; that you&rsquo;re paying to them. Expense ratio is an annual fee an investor is charged by funds or ETFs to operate. The simple math is that the fund will divide its operating expenses by the value of the assets it manages and what&rsquo;s left is the return to the investor. As an investor, you&rsquo;ll want to know what the expense ratio is for investments you select so that there are no surprises. Aim for funds with expense ratios below 1%.</p><h3> 8. Inflation</h3><p> <br/> Inflation is a term that tells us the rate (percentage) at which prices for goods and services are rising. It&rsquo;s expressed as an annual percentage rate. Basically, inflation can detour our finances if we don&rsquo;t invest and grow our money because as things get more expensive, the dollars we have today don&rsquo;t go as far. For example, if the price of your morning coffee increase from $2.00 to $2.05,  that&rsquo;s a 2.5% increase and what your money could have bought you in coffee yesterday, now won&rsquo;t go as far. Prices tend to increase over time, which is why it&rsquo;s important to grow your money and take advantage of things like compound interest.</p><p> By getting a clear understanding of certain financial terms, you&rsquo;re equipping yourself with the knowledge you need to make informed financial decisions. You can also check out more investment terms you should know  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/basic-investing-terms-geny-should-know-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://workablewealth.com/basic-investing-terms-geny-should-know-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</p><p> Remember, if you&rsquo;re ever talking with a financial advisor and don&rsquo;t know a word they use, or concept or strategy they&rsquo;re recommending &ndash;don&rsquo;t ever hold back your questions. You should have questions and you absolutely deserve a financial professional who will take the time to make sure you have sound understanding around your finances.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://www.bluechipcommunication.com.au/blog/author/nicole-leong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Nicole Leong </a></p><p> So you&rsquo;ve just hit &ldquo;Publish&rdquo;. All those days, weeks, maybe months of planning. DONE. All those internal debates. DONE. Hooray. Here we go......</p><p> But wait... Days pass. Then weeks. Your view count is still in the double digits. Is ANYONE coming?</p><p> A new financial year looms. Against a backdrop of market volatility, and some economic uncertainty, it&rsquo;s time to think seriously about budgets for FY17.</p><p> It's also now incumbent on marketing to demonstrate dollar returns. As we&rsquo;ve previously expounded content marketing strategies have to be ever more efficient with spend. If you want to impress your CFO with stellar ROI, achieving more with less is key.</p><p> How?</p><p> Think beyond creation</p><p> If you relate at all to the melodramatic hypothetical situation in the intro (don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve all been there), it&rsquo;s probably time you changed gear. Creation is not the be-all-and-end-all in your content strategy. What&rsquo;s the point of spending all that time and money producing the content if it&rsquo;s sitting idly on your website?</p><p> Because content can only provide value if people, y&rsquo;know, actually see it, we say everyone needs to stop spending more money churning out more content, and instead think about how you can get the most out of each piece. Especially so in an age where new media has it such that the internet is awash with content, most of it frankly quite rubbish, the imperative is to create fewer pieces of high quality, actually-useful, in-depth content and then focus on really getting it out there.</p><h3> Choose your channels <br/>  </h3><p> In an ideal world, as soon as your amazing piece of content comes hot off the figurative press -BAM!- it hits your distribution networks at full speed and -BOOM!- into the hearts and minds of your dear audience.</p><p> But if that were always the case, would you still be sitting here reading this? </p><p> Most companies don&rsquo;t have Kardashian-sized followings on social media or databases hundreds of thousands strong. And that&rsquo;s okay. While it takes time to build these assets, brands can turn to earned and paid channels to distribute content to a wider audience than their own.</p><p> Using earned channels means borrowing someone else&rsquo;s audience &ndash; whether an industry influencer with an engaged following on Twitter, a journalist who writes for a relevant publication or even collective users of social networks &agrave; la social sharing. Of course, these methods of distribution are out of your control and unpredictable, but can be hugely successful if executed well. And one of the simplest ways you can do so is to keep earned distribution in mind when creating the content in the first place &ndash; how do you induce a vested interest in sharing your content?</p><p> Paid distribution brings the benefits of being quick to the draw and reliable, and these days it&rsquo;s common to only pay when you get a click. Digital advertising platforms also have increasingly precise targeting options, which is great for reaching niche audiences. The obvious downside to this type of distribution is that it costs money, and it&rsquo;s only a short term solution compared to building your own relationships.</p><p> Over the next few months, we&rsquo;ll be showing you how to integrate your owned, earned and paid channels to truly leverage your content and engage your B2B and B2C audiences to extract the most value out of it, with real life financial services examples.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>You may have seen the news: We have another drug that is showing some promise in slowing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how it works: Beta amyloid plaques, or build-up of &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; proteins on the neurons, is one characteristic of the disease. Not all people who have beta amyloid plaques have Alzheimer&rsquo;s, but every person with Alzheimer&rsquo;s has beta amyloid plaques. With the aid of improved brain scan techniques that more accurately detect them plaques, one focus of research is to prevent, slow, or dissolve the proteins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many antibodies have been in clinical trials for some time. Crenezumab, for instance, is showing some promise in early-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But recently another antibody called Solanezumab became the first one proven to show definitive results in slowing beta amyloid plaque build-up on neurons, at least temporarily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are still a long way from a cure. There is no drug or treatment, including Solanezumab, which is capable of preventing or curing Alzheimer&rsquo;s. All we can do is slow the progression of symptoms for anywhere from a few months to a few years. There is no &ldquo;fix&rdquo;. Sooner or later the disease takes over again. Yet every step helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Note that research into Alzheimer&rsquo;s is dramatically underfunded compared to other diseases that affect large portions of the population. So consider making a donation to the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association in memory of any clients who are diagnosed with or die from this cruel disease.</li>\r\n\t<li>Include informational tips in your newsletters so you are giving your clients something besides just financial news. You can get information from these newsletters, from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association itself or your local chapter, or from the government</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure that your clients and their aging parents have valid and updated advance directives listing the treatment they want or don&rsquo;t want if they are diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s or other dementias.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create a branded page of resources so you are prepared when a client is concerned about a family member. Include the names of the memory care facilities in the area and make sure you meet the directors so you can make a personal introduction with clients. Ask those directors for the names of geriatric care specialists and doctors who specialize in memory care, so you can have them on your list. Discover where there is adult day care and/or respite care available for those who hope to keep their loved ones at home. Research the availability of meal delivery services, bill payment services, in-home spa services (haircut, massage, manicure/pedicure, etc.), and any other services you find that may help patients or their in-home caregivers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider partnering with the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association and/or Corgenius to host a client education seminar on what to watch for, how to prepare ahead of time, and what resources are available if there is a diagnosis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, one in nine people aged 65 and over have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and someone is diagnosed in the U. S. every 67 seconds. Inevitably, at least some and possibly most of your clients will be affected sooner or later. Prepare them now, and let them know you care about their lives and health, not just their money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/do-you-know-what-to-do-or-say-when-facing-a-client-in-grief-or-transition\">Do You Know What to Do or Say When Facing a Client in Grief or Transition?</a></p>",

    "content": "<h3> It has been over a decade, 12years to be exact, in which Capgemini has been working with Efma to publish our annual World Retail Banking Report (#WRBR16). <br/>  </h3><p> I was in London last week and had a chance to give a sneak peak of the 12th edition at the Efma Distribution Summit. </p><p> At the Summit, we heard from industry leaders like Brett King, Chris Skinner, and Michal Panowicz. We also saw some interesting examples of innovative &ldquo;FinTech&rdquo;, including Ollie Purdue (the 23-year-old CEO of Lootbank). While there may not be consensus on where the industry will be three to five years from now, there was clear consensus in the different panel discussions and in conversations I had throughout the week - Banking is changing at an accelerated pace and banks are still trying to figure out how to keep up given legacy challenges (both core systems and culture).</p><p> For this year&rsquo;s WRBR, we surveyed over 16,000 customers in 32 countries and interviewed over 140 senior executive bankers.</p><h3> Four key take-aways I see from this year&rsquo;s report are: <br/>  </h3><li> Banks&rsquo; investments in the front office have started to pay off with improved customers experience levels, but it has not resulted in impacting customers&rsquo; profitable behavior (e.g., staying with firm, referring friends, or buying additional products)</li><li> FinTechs are not only changing customer perceptions and creating market disruption with their agile and innovative platforms, they are capturing referral mindshare over their banking counterparts.</li><li> The majority of Banks acknowledge the pace of change is accelerating and moving towards a digital ecosystem, but most feel their core systems are not prepared for this change.</li><li> Banks are now seeking ways to incorporate FinTech into their digital banking ecosystems and learn from their digital best practices and ability to exploit new technologies to meet evolving customer expectations.</li><p> Today, I would like to share some of the findings around Customer Experience levels and will write more later in the week on the FinTech themes.  </p><h3> Customer Experience Levels Improving across Globe, but Not Impacting Profitable Behavior <br/>  </h3><p> Over the last two years, banks have finally started to move the dial in creating more positive customer experiences, rising from 39.5% customers having a positive experience in 2015 up to 54.7% in 2016. Latin America was the only region to see a decline this year.</p><p> While Canada remained in the #1 slot in Capgemini's Customer Experience Index (CEI), we saw some significant movement in Western Europe (mostly positive).  </p><p> The Netherlands jumped up all the way #17 to #2, bumping Czech Republic down to #3.  Rounding out the top five countries in our CEI were two Western European countries who also made significant jump - UK rose from #12 up to #4 and Switzerland climbed to #5 out of the #14 ranking last year.</p><p> However, it wasn't all rosy for Europe as Spain dropped from #13 all the way to the bottom.</p><br /><p> However, despite some improvement, banks are still largely struggling with connecting effectively with the younger generations.  </p><p> While positive customer experience levels rose across all ages, younger generations like Gen Y still lag well behind older generations.  </p><p> For example, only 47.7% of Gen Y had positive customer experiences with banks last year vs. 62.4% of those older than Gen X. </p><br /><p> Even more concerning is that despite increases across the board in experience levels, it had minimal impact on customers' profitable behavior. Only a little over half (55.1%) of customers note it was likely they would stay with their primary bank in the next six months. That is only up 1.4 percentage points (PP) from last year, despite the substantial increases in positive customer experience. Those percentages get more concerning as we found only 38.4% of customers noted the likelihood they would refer a friend to their primary bank (just 1.0 PP above last year's 37.4%).  </p><p> And lastly, only 15.9% of customers noted they were likely to buy another product from their primary bank. This number saw minimal improvement on the 15.3% last year.</p><br /><p> One might say, and I have heard this argument before, that customers simply don't look at their banks nor their financial services needs with excitement or affinity.</p><p> However, we asked customers who currently work with FinTech firms for either banking products or services. While only 38.4% of customers were likely to refer their primary bank, that number jumped to 54.9% (over 40% higher than banks).  </p><p> Interestingly, Latin America (the only region with a decrease in customer experience this year) had the highest likely referral rates for FinTech (20 percentage points higher than for banks). This suggest it is not a lost cause for financial services providers to gain customer attention and affinity to their products and services. However, there clearly is still a lot banks can do and can learn from leaders in the industry (especially in FinTech).  </p>",

And gone are the days of waiting in a hotel lobby for a fax to arrive as one click on your device assures delivery.</p><p> With so much ease there is a price to be paid for the super simple technologically connected world. We have forgotten our humanity, connectivity and sometimes eye to eye contact feels like being naked. Everyone is looking down, scrolling screens and connecting to the information highway without a single word of conversation.</p><p> It&rsquo;s time for a different type of power surge and it means leaving the phones behind, for now.</p><p> As nature begins to awaken we need to wake up as well. It&rsquo;s time to head outside and get the type of power surge that only happens when you&rsquo;re looking up and out at the world.</p><h3>  </h3><h3> How often do you watch the sunset? <br/>  </h3><p> The entire sunset, not just 15 seconds as you&rsquo;re running to do something else, taking a call or scrolling through random events on social media. Make it a priority to spend some time in nature and begin to feel the calm nature gives to you as a gift.</p><p> Take a deep breath and slowly exhale. Repeat several times and begin to notice the calming effect this has on your body. Deep breathing helps with relaxation and releasing all those mental cobwebs caused by too much technology.</p><p> Trying looking up and out and you&rsquo;ll be astonished how different the world looks. What do you see? Wow, how does that feel? It&rsquo;s a different world when you&rsquo;re not looking down at texts and emails and actually look at the sky, trees, and people. Yes, humans actually have faces and emit emotions when you remember to engage with them.</p><p> Sounds easy however this gets more and more difficult when you keep your head buried in devices. Eye contact becomes intimidating and conversations stiff. There&rsquo;s a whole world that&rsquo;s not on your screen and it&rsquo;s time to start looking for those connections. Once you start to look up and out you&rsquo;ll find conversations are interesting and thought provoking.</p><p> Connect to your power surge as you spring toward some tech free time and begin to nurture yourself. Until next time, continue Consciously Connecting.</p>",

    "content": "<p> One of the interviewees in my new book ValueWeb is  <u>  <a href=\"http://thefinanser.com/2015/09/who-is-the-typical-user-of-prosper-prosper-is-an-online-marketplace-for-credit-that-offers-access-to-consumer-loans-we-f.html/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ron Suber  </a> </u> , President of Prosper Marketplace Lending. Ron gave a speech last week which is summarized below. Well worth a read.</p><h3> It&rsquo;s clear that just like payments, movies and music have moved online, the global move to online borrowing and lending is well underway. It&rsquo;s unanimous. But, it&rsquo;s not for the faint of heart! <br/>  </h3><p> While we have many evangelists and fans, there are also many skeptics, as well as myths and misperceptions about our industry that have been increasing with every misinformed story that is published.</p><p> The industry is also working feverishly to educate policymakers and inform sound policy development through new organizations, such as the first Marketplace Lending Association.</p><p> Now the industry is at an inflection point. As I noted this year (and last year), our industry has evolved from a novelty, to an interesting new niche, to a great idea.</p><p> In order to become something that people can&rsquo;t live without (i.e. the smartphone), there are changes and improvements that our industry needs to make. These include:</p><li> <strong>  Improving Risk and Underwriting: </strong>  We must continue to improve our risk models, verifications, and collections practices. This is the most important thing we do and it will continue to be the most important thing we do as our industry matures.</li><li> <strong>  Maintaining an Equilibrium in the Marketplace: </strong>  More balance between what I refer to as the left (investors) and right (borrowers) legs of the stool (the marketplace). There are periods of imbalance for any marketplace business &ndash; we&rsquo;ve seen this with Uber and AirBnB as they gain scale and mass adoption. Still, equilibrium is something we all continually strive for and it will continue to be a major focus and priority for all marketplace lending platforms.</li><li> <strong>  Developing New Products:  </strong> We have witnessed a shift in the way people interact with marketplaces on a day-to-day basis, thanks to companies like Amazon and Ebay. If we strive to better understand our customer&rsquo;s daily needs, we can shift the way people interact with their personal finances on a day-to-day basis. To do this, we need to continue to deliver new products and services that make it easier for investors to invest in our loans. Until we increase access to our asset class through new vehicles, we will not be something that people can&rsquo;t live without.</li><li> <strong>  Establishing an Open Ecosystem: </strong>  Open systems thrive, while closed systems become obsolete. From AOL to Blackberry RIM, to the biosphere, we&rsquo;ve seen time and again that closed systems do not scale. Marketplace lending needs to be ubiquitous. To do this, we must maintain an open dialogue, educate and share information with the public and create a broader understanding of our platforms and products. We need to encourage the development of a sophisticated ecosystem for our industry that improves data visualization, transparency, standardization and liquidity. Firms like Orchard, PeerIQ, DVO1 and Monja are already helping to pioneer this ecosystem. <br/>  </li><p> As we look towards the future, I encourage the collective marketplace lending industry to embrace the notion that change is inevitable. This type of change requires a certain amount of resilience but it is necessary. As we go through this evolution together, I urge the industry not to lose sight of our important shared goal: to give people access to affordable credit.</p><h3> Just for further information, here&rsquo;s an overview of Prosper: <br/>  </h3><p> Q4 proved to be a record breaking quarter for Prosper, with $1.15bn in loans originated through the platform. The $1.15bn closes out a year in which a grand total of $3.7bn was lent. That&rsquo;s more than double what the platform accomplished in 2014, when $1.6bn was lent on the year. Prosper&rsquo;s cumulative lending volume now sits somewhere between the $6bn and $7bn mark. SoFi hit the $6bn mark about a week before Christmas. The race for second place in the marketplace lending volume game is heating up.</p><p> We also learn that Prosper hired a massive 105 people in the 4th quarter of 2015 alone. For some perspective, there are perhaps only 3 platforms in the UK &ndash; perhaps less &ndash; that employ over 100 staff. Prosper is now home to 623 employees, up from 238 at the close of 2014.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Whether you lead a global conglomerate or a mid-sized privately-held firm, the effectiveness of your board, and your relationship with the board can have a profound impact on your role and success in achieving company objectives. <br/>  </h3><p> The extreme nature of changes impacting businesses today demands board members who are savvy and attuned to what&rsquo;s required to steer the company they serve in today&rsquo;s global and volatile market. Increased expectations and accountability of board members are based on the pace of change and the size and scope of key board responsibilities such as:</p><li> Is company strategy on target?</li><li> Is today&rsquo;s business model appropriate and flexible enough to meet business goals given constantly shifting market and customer needs?</li><li> Does the company have the talent and resources it needs to succeed?</li><li> Does the company have the agility and resilience needed to address a wide array of potential risks?</li><li> Have the right technology investment priorities been set? <br/>  </li><p> Traditionally, boards have been made up of experts from traditional business areas such as finance, operations, HR, marketing, sales and legal. A full board will then include member expertise across key functional areas.</p><p> Given new business situations, boards are compelled to have both a broader and deeper understanding across an array of topics to make key decisions. To achieve this some boards are adding members in specialty areas such as technology and risk management. Others retain experts in these areas they call on as needed.</p><h3> Traditional Board Responsibilities <br/>  </h3><p> Typically boards are accountable for:</p><li> Governance, protection of stakeholder interests, compliance</li><li> Providing direction for strategy and growth</li><li> Developing top-line financial objectives and metrics</li><li> CEO selection, evaluation and compensation</li><li> Succession planning</li><li> Addressing substantive business issues as they arise <br/>  </li><h3> Board and CEO Relationships <br/>  </h3><p> Although it&rsquo;s critical for boards and CEOs to work cohesively to achieve company goals, that&rsquo;s not always the case in practice. Boards and CEOs at odds decrease both board and CEO effectiveness &ndash; to the company&rsquo;s detriment.</p><p> Chief Executive* polled more than 120 mid-sized company board members across industries to learn &ldquo;what makes CEO-board relationships tick.&rdquo; Nearly 90% believe effective partnerships are based on high levels of trust. Agreement on CEO and board priorities is also critical.</p><p> Achieving and maintaining healthy CEO-board relationships requires effort from both. Each win when company success is prioritized over stringent roles.</p><h3> Board Meeting Priorities <br/>  </h3><p> Boards typically schedule regular meetings well in advance, along with committee meetings led by members with functional area expertise. Certain topics are covered at every board meeting.</p><p> Given the considerable changes businesses are facing, are boards still focusing their attention on the topics of greatest importance? Or, is it time to re-assess priorities?</p><p> Per Inside Council**, directors nearly always rate strategy sessions at &ndash; or near 10 &ndash; on a 1 &ndash; 10 scale, but often board agendas are too packed. Even when plans include adequate time for strategy sessions, in practice other topics squeeze strategy time to the extent it isn&rsquo;t feasible to fully address company strategy.</p><h3> Getting the Balance Right <br/>  </h3><p> Given the importance of company strategy within the board&rsquo;s role, dedicated attention is crucial. One option is moving &ldquo;unplanned topics&rdquo; or new issues to a board subset for resolution and/or recommendations. Another possibility is spreading board strategy topics across several board meetings. Also, including specific strategy topics within committee meetings can help. Strategic company direction, including board and CEO agreement, is too important to be shortchanged.</p><h3> Action Items <br/>  </h3><li> Track the actual amount of time spent on each topic relative to the agenda and priorities. Where time spent doesn&rsquo;t represent focused attention to the most critical priorities find ways to reduce or otherwise handle topics that take more board time than they deserve.</li><li> Evaluate the backgrounds, expertise and skill sets of your board members. Together are topics and issues with the greatest impact on future company success well covered? If not, consider adding one or more board members who can ensure board guidance includes the level of expertise required in all areas. If needed, in the interim bring in subject matter experts to provide input and recommendations.</li><li> If your CEO-board relationship isn&rsquo;t as strong as desired, invest in an objective third-party to help identify primary issues from both sides and work to find common goals, dispel misperceptions, and set mutually-agreed upon working parameters. Reassess the relationship status quarterly.</li><li> Assess the effectiveness of the Board meetings. An outside facilitator is an option for critical strategy sessions and for dedicated focus on new issues.</li> Sources:<br/>* Saporito, Dr. Thomas J., &ldquo;Effective CEO-Board Partnerships: Successful CEO-board relationships demand trust, communication and alignment&rdquo;, Chief Executive, January 5, 2016<br/>** Edwards, Christine A., &ldquo;No time for board strategy discussions &ndash; Has governance gone awry?&rdquo; Inside Counsel, November 1, 2015",

    "content": "<p> Ironstone has the privilege of working with phenomenal advisory teams across the country, and &lsquo;Hear From Your Peers&rsquo; shines a spotlight on a specific topic and gives industry professionals a chance to weigh in with their unique perspective.In this edition we explore Millennials and their impact on advisory firms, both as staff and clients. Sharing her thoughts on these topics is Kate Kooman Starkey of Kooman &amp; Associates. In addition to being the daughter of firm owner Marty Kooman, her husband Jeff Starkey is also employed by the firm. These two Millennials are a key part of the staff and also represent the longterm succession plan for Kooman &amp; Associates.In this interview, Kate shares:</p><li> Benefits Millennials Bring to the Workplace</li><li> The Importance of Having a Millennial on Staff</li><li> Thoughts on Generational Differences with Staff/Clients</li><h3> <strong>  The Interview </strong></h3><h3> Ironstone: As a Millennial, what benefits do you feel you bring to the practice?</h3>Kate: &ldquo;We feel we are able to bring a fresh perspective to the practice, as we both came from successful positions at large institutions in Washington, D.C (Kate was a health care consultant at The Advisory Board Company and her husband Jeff was a tax defense attorney at Sutherland, Asbill, &amp; Brennan). Having experience outside the industry at firms that excel in workflow and the implementation of processes set the ground work for allowing us to lead the way with Andrea&rsquo;s guidance.I think we both have a good appreciation of how technology can be a disruptor in any industry. Unlike a lot other financial advisors, we don&rsquo;t write off robo-advisors because we know how comfortable our generation is with technology, constantly wanting access to information and the ability to do things at their convenience. While we know we offer services that robo-advisors can&rsquo;t, we understand some of the appealing aspects of robo-advisors even for people who have a significant amount of wealth.Additionally, having worked alongside highly successful people and getting to know them well, we appreciate what types of services they are looking for in a financial advisor, in terms of the relationship they are seeking, what services they need and what they want to take care of on their own. After seeking to acquire a younger generation of clients for our firm, we developed a new consulting arrangement to fulfill the needs of this niche.Instead of charging a fee for assets under management, we charge a flat yearly fee to provide a breadth of services that millennials require such as cash flow/budget analysis, insurance examination, college planning, and other services focused on their immediate needs.We&rsquo;ve found that our colleagues who live in big cities have a significant amount of income, but are juggling mortgages, private school for young children, and many other financial issues and just want clarity around how they should be allocating their money to benefit their families most. This consulting arrangement has become a successful foray for our office and a value-added service, demonstrating the need to customize our practice to the client&rsquo;s needs, and more specifically, to the Millennial generation.&rdquo;<h3> Ironstone: What challenges would a firm face without a Millennial point of view on staff?</h3>Kate: &ldquo;Our generation looks at the world differently, we embrace technology and have more faith in technology because we have grown up using it and relying on it for information. I also think that the younger generation is more adaptable to change and willing to innovate, try new things. Additionally, we are trying to appeal to that next generation, specifically our clients&rsquo; children, and having younger staff who connect with those children and understand their issues is extremely important in keeping a family&rsquo;s legacy assets at the firm.&rdquo;<h3></h3><h3> Ironstone: What are your thoughts on generational differences, both for interaction between staff and interaction with clients?</h3>Kate: &ldquo;We are very aware of the fact that we are significantly younger than our average client. We are working closely with Marty and Barbara to seamlessly incorporate our strengths into client interactions and the broader succession plan. It&rsquo;s essential to build long-lasting relationships with clients and our staff. Just like our clients are planning for their future, so is our firm. We&rsquo;re dedicated to thinking about what lies ahead for our clients and creating a sense of continuity and stability in the transition of the firm to the next generation.Having experience working with all generations at our previous firms, we know what people want to see (in terms of presentation) and how they receive information is different. We try to identify early on in a client relationship (and with our team members) their specific preferences on communication style so we can customize how we present to and interact with them.&rdquo;<h3> <strong>  Bonus Content </strong></h3>Kate&rsquo;s parents, Marty &amp; Barbara Kooman, share their insights on generational differences in the workplace with Millennials on staff and as clients.<h3> Ironstone: What are your thoughts on generational differences, both for staff and clients?</h3>Marty: &ldquo;Having Andrea and Ironstone in year two of our Millennial transition was one of the smartest things we&rsquo;ve done, giving us a clear path on which to move forward. This approach recognized the value of the past, yet embraced the necessary changes to be ready for more dynamic change in the future. It helped us with communication between the old guard and the new guard. Ironstone helped our management team come together on important issues facing our combined future and speak with one voice.As for clients, 40% are over 70 and in distribution. The Millennials have helped develop better financial planning, investment and service alternatives for younger clients. Investments more robo-like with a well-qualified and empathetic advisor attached. They&rsquo;ve also developed a fee-for-service consulting model (i.e. Cash Flow Consulting) which we&rsquo;ve now successfully rolled out to a dozen clients. We always wanted to move toward consulting. The Millennials have developed this profitable approach and they&rsquo;re perfecting this new client offering as we grow.&rdquo;Barbara: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; think clients care about the age of the person serving them, as long as the staff member can demonstrate that they truly care about the client, respond to client requests and needs, and exhibit a high level of expertise. Clients have high expectations, and our team is uniquely prepared to meet whatever a client needs. I love that our firm has a mix of advisors, some with years of experience and expertise, and others with great enthusiasm to learn and serve. Clients respect that our team has earned the right to serve them thru training, education, and certifications.We&rsquo;re an office that has made a commitment to incorporate technology into our client service process&hellip;and I think the Millennials appreciate that commitment to keeping current. Our commitment to serve the best interest of each client supersedes the issues of age or expertise. It is the unifying force that drives our success. We can all learn from each other, in many cases, the best way to handle client issues, staff interactions, and how to make technology work for us.&rdquo;&ldquo;Having Andrea and Ironstone in year two of our Millennial transition was one of the smartest things we&rsquo;ve done, giving us a clear path on which to move forward. This approach recognized the value of the past, yet embraced the necessary changes to be ready for more dynamic change in the future.&rdquo;&ndash; Marty Kooman, President &ndash; Kooman &amp; Associates",

    "link": "12-reasons-your-hard-work-isnt-making-you-successful",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Hard work sometimes pays off. Smart thinking combined with smart work will always pay off in the long run even if you stumble in the short term. <br/>  </h3><p> You work hard. You put in the excessive hours. You work tirelessly on personal projects. How often have you wondered why you&rsquo;re not further along in your career or life? How often have you wondered why this project is taking so long?</p><h3> Let me share 12 reasons your hard work isn&rsquo;t making you successful</h3><p>  </p><h3> 1. You think brute force will help you overcome intellectual laziness <br/>  </h3><p> I always preach a moving object is easier to redirect than a stationary one, but constantly working on the wrong or minor tasks won&rsquo;t help you advance in the right direction.</p><p> You must consider any goal or project strategically and with major doses of love and desire. &ldquo;Little thinking&rdquo; breeds little results.</p><h3> 2. You think making mistakes is part of the learning process <br/>  </h3><p> Thomas Edison, bless his heart, remarked this when asked if he was discouraged by his lack of successful attempts when inventing the light bulb, &ldquo;I have not failed. I&rsquo;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p> I hate to break it to you. Failing is just failing. No one actually progresses by failing. All failure does is show you what doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve made a failed attempt, you still need to figure out what actually does work. At your moment of failure, you don&rsquo;t know that yet. Ask any golfer and he or she will know exactly what I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; about.</p><h3> 3. You think preparing a plan will help you feel in control of events that are out of your control <br/>  </h3><p> Plans generally let the past drive the future. This stands to reason because people prepare plans based on what they learned&mdash;in the past.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I&rsquo;m all for planning. I, however, believe in the planning process, not the plan itself. I believe in making frequent, smart adjustments based on what I&rsquo;m feeling and what the outside world is telling me. Listen and you&rsquo;ll hear it. Then, adjust smartly and quickly. By the same token, don&rsquo;t overreact.</p><h3> 4. You insist on seeing the entire picture before you take the first step <br/>  </h3><p> Think about building a house. Do you think the architect who&rsquo;s preparing the blueprint cares about what tile you&rsquo;re to using for the kitchen backsplash? Complete the sketch and get moving. You can figure out the moldings later.</p><h3> 5. You don&rsquo;t quit fast enough because your logic is faulty or your ego is too big <br/>  </h3><p> I wrote an article a few months back titled Are These Biases Killing Your Decisions. One of those biases is the sunken cost bias. You stay with something because you don&rsquo;t want to abandon the time or money or effort you&rsquo;ve already expended.</p><p> You need to think differently. Every dollar or moment already spent is just that&mdash;spent. It&rsquo;s gone. Choose whether you&rsquo;d start this project or career today knowing what you know now.</p><p> And, if you quit, no one will care how you &ldquo;look&rdquo; as much as you do. In fact, next time you want to quite something that doesn&rsquo;t matter to you anymore, imagine me holding up a big sign for you. The sign says, &ldquo;Welcome to the Town of No One Cares. Population 7 Billion.&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. You don&rsquo;t impose proper deadlines <br/>  </h3><p> Deadlines are amazing. They keep you on track. They have a way of making you feel guilty or perhaps sweaty. There are all kinds of goodness that come with deadlines when they&rsquo;re set properly.</p><p> The ones that are set too far in the future are bad. You&rsquo;re as bad at estimating as I am. Set short, frequent deadlines. That way, when you miss one it&rsquo;ll be a minor miss.</p><p> This will also help you discard any initiatives that are no longer worthy of your time (remember the sunken cost bias?). Think of your life as a continuum of deadlines instead of one big one far out into the future.</p><h3> 7. You don&rsquo;t have sound judgment because you work too much and are too tired <br/>  </h3><p> I think I just fell asleep writing this line. Get sleep. Change it up. Stay frosty.</p><h3> 8. You don&rsquo;t curate properly <br/>  </h3><p> Most people who fail have bigger regrets regarding what they said yes to versus what they said no to.</p><p> Repeat after me. Addition by subtracting feels great. Value the acts of purging and curating.</p><p> I once took nine thousand words out of a book to make it better. Get rid of excess. Get rid of people. Get rid of anything that&rsquo;s holding back your progress.</p><h3> 9. You spend too much time fixing inconsequential details <br/>  </h3><p> Some parts of the whole are irrelevant no matter how important you think they are. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the way you stapled the paper (horizontal or vertical anyone?). Other times, it&rsquo;s recoloring the pie chart for your presentation to the executive committee.</p><p> Constantly ask yourself, &ldquo;Would this matter to anyone else but me?&rdquo; If the answer to that question is yes, then ask yourself, &ldquo;Is it worth my time or expense to add it or change it?&rdquo;</p><h3> 10. You think the bells and whistles are just as important as the main ingredient <br/>  </h3><p> This is a huge time suck. Get out version one of whatever it is you want to &ldquo;launch.&rdquo; Then you can go to version 1.1 or version 2.0 or whatever you want to call it.</p><p> Most people spend ten percent of their time getting the first draft to ninety percent complete. Then, they proceed to expend the remaining ninety percent of their time getting the last ten percent complete. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p><h3> 11. You&rsquo;re not motivated because you don&rsquo;t love it <br/>  </h3><p> You might have loved it once. That love might have been genuine or misguided. Either way, if your motivation or love of something is waning, take a breather and reevaluate.</p><p> A few minutes of critical thinking might help you gain clarity. </p><h3> 12. You don&rsquo;t think ahead because you&rsquo;re always thinking behind <br/>  </h3><p> I laugh when I see companies constantly trying to keep up with their competitors. I feel sad when I see individuals trying to &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; with their peers or friends.</p><p> Companies and people are constantly looking at what has already been done! Think about it. It&rsquo;s the only way you can make a comparison. You have to see what&rsquo;s been done to know how far behind you are.</p><p> Forget that nonsense. Stay true to yourself and what you want accomplish. Go where your heart tells you to go. I promise your heart never lies. Just be ready. You will need to ignore a lot of criticism if you want to see the unseen. It&rsquo;s all worth it. Trust me.</p><p> As always, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you: What are the biggest reasons you don&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;re getting ahead in life?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> I&rsquo;ve had the privilege to work with a lot of senior executives who have found themselves in transition. <br/>  </h3><p> Amazing men and women who have been in workforce 20 to 30 years, and for a multitude of reasons have found themselves, often for the first time in their careers, looking for &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next&rdquo;.</p><p> Most have accomplished a great deal. Most have made an impressive salary. Most have impressive &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that they purchased with their impressive salaries. Most had title-related-power in their jobs. Most people on the outside looking in would say these people were very &ldquo;successful&rdquo;.</p><p> Yet interestingly, many of them did not think of themselves that way. As they didn&rsquo;t feel successful.</p><p> Many of them were road warriors, with an impressive collection of airline miles. Many of them had struggled with relationships. Many of them had missed dance recitals, birthdays, prom nights, boy scout outings, helping out with homework, parent-teacher-conferences, etc. Many of them, 20 to 30 years later, in transition found themselves asking &ldquo;why&rdquo;? What was it all for? They had climbed the ladders, did what they were supposed to do, achieved impressive heights, had a nice home, sent their kids to good schools, had built a life that exuded &ldquo;success&rdquo;. So why didn&rsquo;t they feel successful?</p><p> I&rsquo;m not arguing against working long hours &ndash; to do great things often takes great sacrifice. I&rsquo;m not arguing against being ambitious, against moving up, against making a nice living or having nice things. But I&rsquo;ve found that when our definition of success is anchored in all the externals, (the title, the salary, the stuff &ndash;  or even those less obvious ones that I struggle with &ndash; approval and recognition) when we look to something outside ourselves to make ourselves okay, we ultimately lose. We can never earn enough, have enough, be enough to feel successful. If who we are is anchored in externals, it&rsquo;s like building a foundation on quick sand.</p><p> What a conundrum! We want all the stuff, the recognition, to have the world&rsquo;s seal of approval  (Yes!  You are a success! &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve got 10,000 &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; to prove it!). Yet we don&rsquo;t want our identity to be dependent on those things &ndash; we want to feel we have value, with or without the title.</p><p> Because we do. </p><p> So what&rsquo;s the alternative? In a world that throbs with images of what it means to be successful, how do we chart a different path?</p><p> It really all comes down to focus. When we focus our attention on the externals, we often lose ourselves in the fray.  We may get results, but often at a cost to ourselves, to the people around us, and to our organizations.  What is achieved then is often a fraction of what is possible.</p><p> When we focus our attention instead on the impact we want to have outside ourselves, we put ourselves on an active path that is inherently connected to what matters to us the most.  When we&rsquo;re focusing on impact we&rsquo;re always paying attention to how our actions are effecting others and our organizations, and adjusting our tactics along the way.  Because we&rsquo;re paying attention to impact our results are exponentially better.</p><p> But not better because we focused on the results.</p><p> Curious, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> If we want to feel successful, we need to stay connected to what matters to us most for real and take consistent, constructive action toward that end.  You don&rsquo;t need a new job to do that.  You don&rsquo;t need a new title.  You simply need to ask yourself, &ldquo;I do what I do for the sake of what?&rdquo;  What is the impact you want to have outside yourself?</p><p> On your direct reports? On your colleagues? On your clients? On your organization?</p><p> Focus on that. Make an impact. And with or without the title, the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, or anyone&rsquo;s approval you&rsquo;ll feel successful.</p>",

    "title": "Selling Your Business? 4 Ways to Get Top Dollar",
    "link": "selling-your-business-4-ways-to-get-top-dollar",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> What makes buyers pay top dollar for your business? More to the point: If you decide to sell your business what can you do to get top dollar for your business? <br/>  </h3><p> The answer to those questions may be simple: business value. But the actions to take when a business owner is trying to increase business value is not as simple. One way to increase the business value is through financial measurement and management.</p><h3> There are four ways to take on this task:  <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Understand and use existing financial information </strong></p><p> We frequently work with successful business owners to make better use of their existing financial information so that day-to-day activities and requirements don&rsquo;t overshadow broad and strategic planning. When your client started their business, they had a strategic vision and they can reconnect with that vision by regularly setting aside a reasonable amount of time to track their company&rsquo;s performance from an objective and quantitative perspective.</p><p> <strong>  2. Manage and reduce company debt </strong></p><p> Company debt is not inherently negative. In many cases, loans from outside financing sources facilitate growth more quickly than can be supported through internal financing of business opportunities. On the other hand, debt can also create additional stress and prevent growth by tying up needed cash flow. For these reasons, we often recommend that owners create strategic plans to manage the debt that supports business growth (and in turn, supports growth of business value) and to reduce debt that stifles growth and value.</p><p> <strong>  3. Implement financial controls </strong></p><p> Building value without specific financial goals and measures usually results in a less efficient path to success. Performance goals and limits provide the framework for successful operations and a more valuable business. As an owner develops quantifiable measures for their financial commitments and expectations, they create a more dynamic relationship between internal financial decisions and objective business value.</p><p> <strong>  4. Increase employee productivity </strong></p><p> Owners may feel frustrated because they feel they are too involved in the day-to-day operations of the business or have a nagging feeling that employees could demonstrate greater productivity and efficiency? Owners can work with their management level employees to drive the productivity of these employees. When employees consistently perform at the highest levels of productivity and effectiveness, the business deserves the premium value that buyers associate with a high level of productivity.</p><p> It is important to take note of a critical mistake that can be made&mdash;a business owner&rsquo;s understanding of financial systems and controls may not grow at the same pace as their business grows. When a business grows, finances become more important and that means there is more at stake and more sophisticated measurement tools and controls are needed.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> The best bosses put employees at ease, diffuse tension between team members, inspire others to want to do better, and recognize and appreciate a job well done. <br/>  </h3><p> On the other side of the coin are those leaders (and we all know them) who, through avoidable mistakes and a general lack of consideration, slowly chip away at their company&rsquo;s culture and spew toxicity into the office environment.</p><p> A solid company culture is key to employee retention. A Columbia University study shows that:</p><li> Organizations with rich company culture have a mere 13.9% job turnover</li><li> Organizations with poor company culture have an alarming 48.4% job turnover</li><p> Company culture is also an important factor in employee productivity. The Department of Economics at the University of Warwick has found:</p><li> Happy workers are 12% more productive than the average worker</li><li> Unhappy workers are 10% less productive</li><p> These numbers illustrate the significance of worker satisfaction and should encourage struggling leaders to examine their company culture &mdash; an aspect of a business that is often lacking.</p><p> Here are the top 10 things to avoid doing if you want to keep the culture at your company cool, calm, and cohesive, thereby retaining your employees and productivity.</p><li> <strong>  Pulling the money card:  </strong> Oftentimes, companies with a lot of capital will invest heavily in fancy perks while ignoring some of what really makes an employee stick around, such as a united vision for growth and meaningful work. Bosses may offer monetary incentives for extended work hours and greater commitments but ignore their employees&rsquo; personal needs. No one wants to be a sellout &mdash; your job is to make a work environment that employees will want to be a part of even if they could go and make more money elsewhere.</li><li> <strong>  Yes, you're a boss. </strong> No, you shouldn't be bossy: All employees need direction and guidance from their leaders, but the ultimate goal is to help them become self-sufficient and confident in their ability to innovate. If you rule your employees with an iron fist, requiring them to run everything by you with no breathing room, they will most likely leave for a job that offers more autonomy and opportunity to exercise their creative and independent spirits.</li><li> <strong>  Putting yourself on the other side of the continental divide: </strong>  Do you expect your employees to act in accordance with company values, be willing to re-evaluate their work, and participate in important training exercises? If such is the case, leadership should be doing all of that and more. You should be on your employee's&rsquo; side: willing and able to do what you require of someone else. A leader should be the one most invested in company initiatives, even those that may seem basic or less significant.</li><li> <strong>  Allowing stress to bubble over: </strong>  A short-tempered, high-strung boss can only lead to one thing: a stressed-out team. And when the team is not happy, the company culture turns dreary, productivity decreases, and employees leave for greener pastures. When an employee starts to vent to you, instead of letting the anxiety build, take the time necessary to listen and diffuse the situation.</li><li> <strong>  One bad apple ruins the bunch: </strong>  In order for a company to have an actual &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; there needs to be commonalities between employees. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they all need to look or act the same, or even have similar interests (diversity is extremely important to a productive workforce), but there must be a general sense that people get along and respect each other. Even a single bad employee, one who perhaps gossips incessantly, slacks off, or even worse (embezzlement and selling trade secrets are things that really do happen) can spoil the atmosphere for everyone. Take the time to hire the right people. Doing so will make sure that not only your customers are properly cared for, but that your entire team will be more comfortable and settled.</li><li> <strong>  Treating employees like minions:  </strong> Your team is just as valuable to your business as your customers are, and they need to be treated as such. Relating to employees like a herd of cattle is hardly going to help them to capitalize on their strengths. People should be recognized as individuals and appreciated for their accomplishments. An easy way to recognize your employees is through small gifts: treat them to a night at the movies, offer a gift certificate for a popular restaurant, or even simply mention those who have gone above and beyond their job description in the weekly team meeting. The more you help your staff grow towards their unique roles, the more loyalty they will feel towards your company or organization.</li><li> <strong>  Hoarding your team's accomplishments: </strong>  Good leaders lead by example, setting their egos aside and humbly recognizing all of the people that contribute to a successful business. They know how to give credit where credit is due, sharing in the joy of accomplishments with their employees and acknowledging their important contributions. Teams need willful and positive communication from their leaders, and they need to know they are on the right track and that they are valued. Without this type of communication, employees often feel confused about where they stand with leadership and are more likely to leave for a position that offers more clarity.</li><li> <strong>  Creating an in-house color war: </strong>  Yes, your company is competing with similar companies for business and clout, but that is where competition should come to a halt. As a leader, you should encourage each individual to act upon their strengths, not to simply outdo the guy in the office next door. Within a company, everyone should feel part of the team, one that encourages each of its members to do their best. Don&rsquo;t confuse motivation with competition, however. It is a positive sign that your employees want to do their best, to be the best, but when it comes at the expense of the team, it has gone too far.</li><li> <strong>  Assuming bosses know best: </strong>  Employees are often the ones most familiar with the dregs of your company&rsquo;s operation. Their perspective is almost always valuable and should be heard even when it is not. Learn to listen and to take others seriously. Who knows, maybe they have the secret to your next big break?</li><li> <strong>  Tipping the work/life scale too far:  </strong> One of your employees has a sick baby? A nephew&rsquo;s graduation? A parent undergoing surgery? If your policy is &ldquo;be here or else,&rdquo; you may be in the game for some short-lived tenures. Of course, frequent and inexcusable absence or lateness is never okay, but lacking in compassion for your employees' personal lives definitely doesn&rsquo;t elicit continued loyalty. Take interest in the individuals that make up your team and show them that they matter to you as people, not just workers.</li><p> Being a good leader is a balance between constantly analyzing your current behavior and deciding which new tactics will best serve your employees.</p><p> Oftentimes, leaders focus on what they can do to improve company culture without first analyzing current behavior for any wrongdoings. By following these 10 tips of what not to do, you can avoid making any of the key mistakes that so often send employees looking for greener pastures.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"http://sweetfishmedia.com/author/sambaltergmail-com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Sam Balter  </u> </a></p><p> Sometimes changing your email campaigns or strategy can seem like a daunting task.</p><p> Making a few small adjustments to your email marketing campaigns can greatly improve open rates, conversion rates, and drive higher engagement. Instead of thinking about big changes and huge initiatives, consider just making several minor tweaks to your campaigns to see big results.</p><p> Here are 12 minor tweaks you can make to your emails. Each of these adjustments take less than an hour to implement and can have a huge impact on your email marketing campaigns. </p><h3> 1) Make your subject line a question <br/>  </h3><p> Most people use the subject as a title for their email marketing, but the goal is often to get a response to a targeted question. Make that question your subject line.</p><h3> 2) Change who the email comes from <br/>  </h3><p> If you have emails coming from marketing@yourcompany, try using a real employee&rsquo;s name or create a mascot that aligns with your brand.</p><h3> 3) Use dynamic content in subject line <br/>  </h3><p> Hi [First Name] is common in the body of an email but can do wonders for open rates when its used in the subject line.</p><h3> 4) Personalize the Call-to-Action <br/>  </h3><p> If you use call-to-action buttons you may be shocked by how much lift you get from changing &ldquo;Download eBook&rdquo; to &ldquo;Get eBook&rdquo; to &ldquo;Get eBook Now&rdquo;. Personalize your content even more by offering  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/strategies-for-targeting-dynamic-ctas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Dynamic CTA&rsquo;s  </a> </u>  (smart CTA&rsquo;s based on what the user has already downloaded)  </p><h3> 5) Add a picture <br/>  </h3><p> A picture is worth a thousand words so don&rsquo;t be afraid to add at least one to your emails. Try using something to explain how your product works, a humorous cartoon, or maybe just an image that resonates with your audience.</p><h3> 6) Font Style and Font Size <br/>  </h3><p> Non-designers don&rsquo;t appreciate the  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-10689931\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   power of a good font  </a> </u> . Adjust the size and style of your font to emphasize key points.</p><p> <a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3_53.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"email marketing\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/sweetfishmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3_53.jpg?resize=1024%2C400\"/> </a></p><h3> 7) More Color <br/>  </h3><p> A small bouquet of flowers can have a large effect the feel of a room. Find an aspect of your email design such as the a header, a line divider, or a footer that might need a fresh coat of color.</p><h3> 8) Add Icons <br/>  </h3><p> They are a simple way to denote what your email is about. Icons are a great addition to emails with multiple sections, such as a newsletter or an onboarding email.</p><h3> 9) Make your Call-to-Action a Powerful Image <br/>  </h3><p> Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to ditch a button for a powerful image with compelling text. If you want to knock someone&rsquo;s socks off try an explanatory GIF like this one:</p><h3> 10) Resend your un-opened subscribers  <br/>  </h3><p> This is my favorite workflow trick. If someone didn&rsquo;t open my first email then I send second email a few days later, at a different time, with a new subject line. If you&rsquo;re new to email marketing automation this  <u>  <a href=\"http://info.cpvinc.com/inbound-and-content-marketing-explained-2?__hssc=119642583.1.1440866658937&amp;__hstc=119642583.19e7bcbd5c4d4ec1953c712e3fabcc25.1440084844298.1440428671555.1440866658937.5&amp;hsCtaTracking=fa50e80b-09ac-404f-8f07-8d1995d7a3c2%7C192eb5d3-cfee-4f7d-82b2-3621ebf08bdc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   eBook on Content Marketing  </a> </u>  will be a huge help.</p><h3> 11) Create internal notifications <br/>  </h3><p> When someone fills out a form on your website make sure that not only marketing is receiving an update, also ensure your sales team is kept in the loop. Try text based notifications for a faster response because they are opened 98% of the time in under 15 minutes.</p><h3> 12) Change the time of day <br/>  </h3><p> It&rsquo;s usually most effective to send emails in the morning and right after lunch but you will never know what works best for your customers unless you experiment with sending emails at different times.  </p><h3> Conclusion <br/>  </h3><p> So there you have it. Use these minor tweaks and you will be on your way to higher performing emails.</p> ",

    "content": "<h3> Retirement is supposed to be the Golden Years. <br/>  </h3><p> We work hard and sock away a portion of our earnings for years so that we can relax and enjoy the fruits of our labours. Since Canadians are enjoying longer, healthier lives, we can expect to live longer and better in retirement. Not everyone is looking forward to the day when they won&rsquo;t have to go into work, though. Some people even find themselves dreading retirement.</p><p> In their book,  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Retirement-Maze-Should-Before-Retire/dp/1442216182\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  The Retirement Maze: What You Should Know Before and After You Retire </a> , by Rob Pascale, Louis H. Primavera and Rip Roach, close to half of retirees (45 percent) miss their jobs. This number doesn&rsquo;t drop, even as people settle into their new &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; as retired people.</p><p> According to Pascale and his co-authors, retirees still miss participating working more than a decade after leaving the workforce. Is this a sign that something is fundamentally wrong with us?</p><h3> How your Identity Becomes Tied to your Job <br/>  </h3><p> The issue here is not retirement; it&rsquo;s more about the way you have planned for retirement. You may have spent a lot of time during the years you were working talking about and focusing mainly on the financial aspect of your retirement plan. While this is important, and you need to have the resources in place to finance the lifestyle you want, it&rsquo;s only one part of the overall picture.</p><p> Your work is not just something that provides a source of income. For a great many people, it gives them a sense of identity along with providing structure to their day. If you meet a new person at a social event and are asked about yourself, the first thing you are likely to share is what type of job you have. You don&rsquo;t answer the question, &ldquo;I work as a&hellip;,&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a&hellip;&rdquo; This is an indication of how our identity is tied to the way we make a living.</p><p> Going into retirement without having a specific plan for how to fill in the eight or more hours that normally would be spent at work may seem like a vacation &mdash; but only for the initial &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; phase. After that point, retirement may not be as satisfying as you had hoped.</p><h3> Alternative to Dreading Retirement: Talking About it Now <br/>  </h3><p> How will talking about coping with retirement now help you when the time comes? Getting these issues out in the open means you can look at them and work out a plan so that you aren&rsquo;t suddenly facing huge chunks of time with nothing to fill it.</p><li> Rather than going from working full-time to fully retired, you may decide to ease into a retirement lifestyle by slowly decreasing you&rsquo;re working hours over a few months or years. Your financial advisor can help you determine how this would look so you can make the choice that best fits your needs.</li><li> Many retirees say they miss the relationships they had with coworkers. If you don&rsquo;t need to generate income in retirement, consider volunteer for an organization, coaching, mentoring or helping out in some capacity. It will keep you busy and help you make some new friends.</li><li> Make a point of taking up a new hobby or interest that you didn&rsquo;t have the time to pursue while you were working. Sign up for a class or lessons as a way to mark this new phase in your life.</li><p> Ultimately, a good financial plan gives you the freedom to choose to live the way you want to in retirement. It allows you to decide to work because you want to, not because you have to. You can fill your days with activities that are meaningful to you, and you will no longer have to be dreading retirement.</p>",

The second was ecommerce, the prediction that brick and mortar enterprises were about to be displaced with \"click\" and mortars.</p><p> Did this all happen? Yes and no. Mobile phones indeed became the fastest-adopted consumer technology of all time. And online shopping is now a convenient and cost-effective route for buying stuff.</p><p> But we didn&rsquo;t change what we do, just how we do it.</p><p> These revolutions simply added another tool for doing things we were already doing anyway. We are still communicating and shopping (and in 2015, the Fortune-500 still had brick and mortars Walmart in the #1 spot, CVS in #10, and Costco in #18), but we&rsquo;ve changed the how&mdash;not the what.</p><p> Social selling is headed down this exact same road.</p><p> From vendors of social selling apps and social networks to industry analysts, experts, and pundits, everyone by now has caught onto the fact that social selling is big. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, just read Hubspot&rsquo;s article  <u>  <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/why-not-being-on-social-media-is-a-huge-mistake-for-salespeople-infographic?__hstc=207358348.80809e5f8f99d916643022a52685d513.1460497316246.1460497316246.1461078501995.2&amp;__hssc=207358348.1.1461078501995&amp;__hsfp=1937137027\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"Why Not Being Active on Social Media Is a Huge Mistake For Salespeople\"  </a> </u>  for a few good reasons why you, too, should be selling with social.</p><p> But social selling is not a panacea. It&rsquo;s not a cure-all for your sales woes. It won&rsquo;t magically make your salespeople any better at the bread-and-butter aspects of selling: connecting with buyers, uncovering needs, demonstrating impact, overcoming objections, and presenting compelling solutions to name a few. All of these things are still just called \"selling.\"</p><p> Social selling author and expert Barbara Giamanco makes a great point in her article <u>     <a href=\"http://barbaragiamanco.com/why-im-over-social-selling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   \"Why I'm Over Social Selling,\"  </a> </u>  stating that \"Anyone with any real sales background already understands that social channels are nothing more than another set of 'tools' that you can avail yourself of to reach potential buyers.\"</p><p> Social selling is not the \"new\" selling, and it&rsquo;s not going to displace anything, besides perhaps some aspects of prospecting. Great sellers will build relationships well before they meet up with buyers through sharing valuable content, expressing their opinions and expertise online, and standing out in a crowded space. Social selling will allow both sides (buyers and sellers) to gather intelligence about each other and come to the table more informed.</p><p> And in five year&rsquo;s time, we&rsquo;ll just call that a part of \"selling.\" The thought of picking up the phone and dialing a perfect stranger with hardly any preparation in an effort to secure a meeting will be as alien to us as the idea that once we were actually \"dialing\" on a rotary phone.</p><p> True sales success isn&rsquo;t built on how well you are able to connect with decision makers on your favorite social media platform, how much time you spend answering questions on forums, or your follower count on Twitter.</p><p> Sure, those things all contribute, in their own way. But they&rsquo;re not what&rsquo;s going to close the deal. Not by a long shot.</p><p> Social selling has its place in the early phases of the sales cycle in prospecting and building thought leadership. Everything that follows still requires solid sales skills like educating your buyer with new ideas and perspectives.</p><p> In the end, social selling is just...selling. </p>",

    "link": "7-critical-conversations-to-turn-leads-into-prospects-prospects-into-clients",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Bill Bachrach</p><p> There are vital ingredients necessary to engage people in the conversations that turn leads into prospects, prospects into clients, and clients into people who take action on your advice and refer you to their friends, family, and colleagues.</p><p> These vital ingredients are easy to understand but hard to master.</p><h3> <strong>  Let's first examine the vital ingredients, The 7 Critical Conversations </strong> <br/>  </h3><h3> Critical Conversation #1: Mastery of the first conversation <br/>  </h3><p> Every future Ideal Client relationship starts with a stranger. However you choose to prospect and market, your ability to engage strangers is critical to your success. <br/> How do you engage a person or couple, in any situation or environment, in a way that inspires them to want to talk to you again without coming across like a schmucky financial salesperson trolling for business? <br/> This is a skill that anyone who is dedicated can master. It&rsquo;s about asking the right questions, listening with empathy, hearing what&rsquo;s most meaningful, important, significant, and compelling to them, and then being able to make an offer to take a simple first step that&rsquo;s relevant FOR THEM.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #2: Mastery at scheduling the appointment <br/>  </h3><p> How do you inspire people, both spouses, to come to your office with all of their financial documents? Given all the demands on their time and all of their options for getting financial education, information, advice, and products&hellip; what will be the reason they agree to take the time to get their financial documents together, carve time out of their busy work schedules or retirement activities to come see you?</p><p> It won&rsquo;t happen by accident. It&rsquo;s a skill that can be mastered. Scripted, practiced, and executed in the real world.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #3: Mastery at opening the first face-to-face meeting is vital <br/>  </h3><p> People have embedded in their subconscious minds an imaginary trust dial. And everything you say and do moves the needle on the trust dial one direction&hellip; or the other. We&rsquo;re talking about the first 45 to 60 seconds. It HAS to be scripted. It has to be scripted word for word and you have to practice those words over and over and over again until you are brilliantly effective. Not just at delivering the words, but with the right tonality, the right facial expressions, and with a totally trustworthy way of being.</p><p> Do you remember that scene from the movie Jerry McGuire where Renee Zelweiger&rsquo;s character said, &ldquo;You had me at hello?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s your goal: to have them at hello.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #4: Mastery at making an emotional connection in the face-to-face interview <br/>  </h3><p> What follows the opening is a conversation, with each spouse, about their personal core values. Core values are the emotional why that drive all of their important decisions. Most FAs jump too quickly into asking clients about their goals without laying an emotional foundation of why they want what they want. The skill to set this emotional foundation is crucial. Why always precedes what.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #5: Mastery at helping people define clear targets with specific dates and amounts of money wanted <br/>  </h3><p> Their goals are the tangible what they want built on the foundation of their values. You can develop the skill to lead an emotionally compelling and inspiring conversation about their goals. It&rsquo;s a skill, maybe even an art form. And it&rsquo;s learn-able.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #6: Mastery at financial benchmarking <br/>  </h3><p> The skill to handle their financial documents with finesse&hellip; without getting deep into the details or the irrelevant stories about the history of each document. This is a 10-minute benchmarking exercise that establishes their current position on the road to achieving their most important goals and fulfilling their most deeply held values. Sometimes the skill to be developed is learning what NOT to say. It&rsquo;s okay to have a thought you don&rsquo;t express, right? Otherwise, you end up with LONG meetings that deter people from hiring you.</p><p> Remember the confused mind says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think it over.&rdquo; Why do they have to think it over? Because there was too much detail to make a decision right now. We value people who simplify our lives and save us time. This is a skill you can master.</p><h3> Critical Conversation #7: Mastery to articulate your value promise and make your offer for them to become a client <br/>  </h3><p> How succinctly and effectively can you articulate your value promise? How well can you answer the two simple client questions, &ldquo;How much does it cost?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;What do I get?&rdquo; without over-explaining the details or giving a lecture that would only interest a graduate student in economics, but bores your prospects and clients to tears.</p><p> If you &ldquo;had them at hello&rdquo; you can easily lose them here. When this face-to-face meeting is done effectively you much more often hear, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get started&rdquo; and you seldom hear, &ldquo;We need to think it over.&rdquo;</p><p> The collective mastery of these 7 Critical Conversations will give you the skill and the confidence to talk to anyone, any time, anywhere&hellip;The skill and confidence to speak with any one, any time, anywhere is how you get the clients you really want, build the business you really want and live the life you really want. <br/> The most brilliant financial planning technician, the most savvy investment advisor, the most talented wealth manager, or the most knowledgeable insurance, estate planning, or tax expert does not stand a chance of building an Ideal Clientele without a high level of skill and confidence with these 7 Critical Conversations.</p><p> Successful veterans enroll in this program now because they want to take their successful business to the next level by trading out some non-ideal clients for more Ideal Clients or converting the investment-centric business to a more sustainable planning and advice business. Instead of retiring, or before you sell your business, build the business you always really wanted: A finite number of Ideal Clients who pay you all the money you need to live your ideal life, keep your own financial house in order, fund all of your goals that require money to achieve. With the right number of Ideal Clients you can organize your client meetings so you work every other month and take 6 months / year to pursue your other interests.</p><p> Perhaps you need a place to send your junior advisors for training so they can bring in Ideal Clients of their own rather than just mooching off your business.</p><p> Newer advisors who are still in the business-building phase enroll now to build an Ideal Client business earlier in your career. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to have a finite number of ideal clients who pay you all the money you need to live your ideal life, get and keep your own financial house in order, fund all of your goals that require money to achieve and have an excellent work / life balance?</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> As a Financial Advisor, having an online presence is necessary to reach new prospects and establish yourself as a thought leader.With so many Advisors making the shift to creating an online presence, just having a website is no longer enough.When creating a website, it is important to implement an effective Search Engine Optimization strategy. In this  <u>  <a href=\"/sell/content-marketing/5-ways-to-optimize-your-websites-content-through-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   2-part series  </a> </u> , we will walk through 10 different ways to help optimize your Advisor website.</p><h3> 6. Reputable Links</h3> It is widely recognized that websites with reputable links are highly preferred by customers. Bad backlinks include links from websites that are irrelevant, spam and websites that are ad-heavy. These diminish your Advisor website&rsquo;s appeal and feel less credible. Thus, the more relevant and reputable the links are on your website, the higher your website&rsquo;s ranking will be.<h3> 7. Fast Page Load Time</h3> A one second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions (<a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Kissmetrics</a>). When searching for information, most customers look for something quick and concise. A great way to avoid long page load times is to ensure the size of images you use are small &ndash; try for 690 pixels or less.Having a responsive web design is a key factor, as many clients want to be able to access your website on any device. This ensures that clients are provided with an optimal viewing and interaction experience. Doing this can help you decrease bounce rates on your website and help increase your conversion rate all while increasing your search engine ranking.<h3> 8. Use catchy titles for your content</h3> Viewers often skim through titles of articles and posts until one catches their eye. Having a catchy title is the key to driving more traffic to your Advisor website. A title that sparks curiosity determines whether a reader chooses to read your content or to skip over and read someone else&rsquo;s. So be sure to create a title that is eye-catching, concise and unique.<h3> 9. Add fresh and relevant Content</h3> As Bill Gates once said, &ldquo;Content is King.&rdquo; Without unique content, your Advisor website would blend in with the crowd. When viewers visit a site, they are looking for timely, relevant and new information. Ensure that your content is always up to date with the current happenings of the world as this shows that you are on top of current trends and it can also help to increase traffic from your target audience.<h3> 10. Include a Landing Page</h3> An attention-grabbing landing page is vital to increasing traffic to your Advisor website and can improve your search ranking. A landing page is a single web page that appears when a customer clicks on your website through a search engine or other websites that have linked to you. Landing pages are a striking factor in the process of generating leads as they can leave your prospects with a memorable experience, and thus should include a CTA so the customer has the option to get into contact with you.SEO is crucial to your overall digital success as a Financial Advisor. A strong SEO strategy can help increase relevant traffic your website receives. Use these 10 tips to get started on strengthening your Search Engine Optimization strategy.  In no time, you&rsquo;ll start to drive more of your target audience to your Financial Advisor website.For more tips for success, check out <u> <a href=\"/sell/content-marketing/5-ways-to-optimize-your-websites-content-through-seo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  part 1 of this series </a></u>.",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/actonsoftware\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Kevin Bobowski  </u> </a> | <a href=\"https://www.act-on.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Act-On  </u> </a></p><p> Anyone who knows me well knows I am a passionate sports fan (Chicago Cubs, Michigan State Spartan). Broadway musicals? Not so much except, maybe, for &ldquo;Les Miserables&rdquo;. But I could not ignore this quote from one of today&rsquo;s hottest musicals, <strong>  Hamilton:  &ldquo;Look at where we are. Look at where we started.&rdquo; </strong> It&rsquo;s an arresting overture, arriving right as the embattled politician himself (Alexander Hamilton) reaches a critical crossroads. It&rsquo;s with me today as I consider all that has changed in marketing, and all that&rsquo;s likely to change in the years ahead. Marketing has never been more exciting, or challenging, than it is today, and there&rsquo;s no way we can look ahead at what awaits us without first looking at where we are today, and where we started.</p><p> In these times of rapid change &ndash; from new technologies to smarter buyers &ndash; you can either rise to the occasion or miss out on the next great opportunity. With how quickly change happens, how does the CMO - and the marketing team stay relevant?  What can be done to build a high-performing, sustainable marketing department that balances brand awareness, demand generation and customer marketing?</p><h3> It starts with the customer experience</h3><p> <br/> At one time, it was all about the brand -- the Don Draper way: air cover was our mission, branding was broad and often lifestyle-focused, insights were minimal. And then, of course, the pendulum swung significantly the other way. Data became the rule, and demand generation the method. A lot of this is to digital marketing&rsquo;s credit: it changed the game overnight, and forced us all to reorder our priorities. But a lot of this has meant the same bad habits of old have carried over. Maybe we rely too heavily on demand generation to support our businesses. &ldquo;Sloppy growth&rdquo; is widespread, and marketers everywhere are having to &ldquo;rethink marketing&rdquo; entirely.</p><p> Just as the competitive landscape changes, your buyers change too. Buyers have the power to research many choices and options, evaluate your offering, and reject you as an option without even contacting you. Because this is the modern buyer&rsquo;s experience, it is more vital than ever to make sure that your messaging is consistent across every touchpoint and every channel from from their first brand contact to well beyond the sale. A great customer experience results in satisfied customers. And happy, satisfied customers build a brand. </p><p> Simply put, marketers need to be thinking more about the lifetime value of a customer than just about the acquisition of the customer. The focus needs to be not just on getting people in the door &ndash;  though that definitely needs to happen &ndash; but also on making sure your customers are successful after they&rsquo;ve passed through that door. That could mean how they are onboarded, or how they are successful using your product or service over time.</p><p> At Act-On, we were keen to find out just what marketers today thought about their discipline -- the value they placed on brand, demand, and customer marketing initiatives, and the ways in which they allocated budget and staff across these three areas. Today, we&rsquo;re pleased to publish our findings, in our report  <u>  <a href=\"http://interactive.act-on.com/press/rethink-marketing-automation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Rethink Marketing,&rdquo;  </a> </u>  which surveys more than 250 senior level marketers in the continental US.  <br/> <br/> This report taught us several things. For one, many businesses have already cast wide nets in their marketing efforts; the majority of companies surveyed (87 percent in all) reported that they spent the bulk of their time in marketing functions outside of demand generation. For another, there may in fact be a real strategic value to casting those nets. Top performing companies (those that met or exceeded revenue expectations in the last fiscal year) spend less time on demand generation than underperforming companies.  <br/> <br/> But most critically, this report showed us that in spite of this balance, many marketers have yet to apply marketing automation solutions beyond demand generation. Of course, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why -- marketers have long been partial to demand generation, and demand generation itself has been marketing automation&rsquo;s primary use case for more than a decade. But it&rsquo;s high time CMOs rethink these habits and take a long look at marketing automation&rsquo;s relationship to the customer experience more broadly.  <br/> <br/> It&rsquo;s a technology with significant value to offer at every stage, from brand awareness to demand generation to customer retention and loyalty. The same segmentation, scoring, and nurturing capabilities you may leverage to acquire customers can be just as easily applied to other outreach efforts, well across the business -- influencer relations (PR),, customer retention, customer activities. Act-On has accounted for this by enriching and expanding its own functionalities, to provide marketers an integrated workspace that supports their every brand, demand, and customer marketing effort. But such evolutions in technology can only go so far if marketers and executives aren&rsquo;t willing to adjust their thinking and reframe their views. CMOs can&rsquo;t allow themselves to only focus on demand generation. They need to see themselves as stewards of the brands they represent, and work hard to facilitate a consistent customer experience across the customer lifecycle. A CMO needs to make sure she addresses all functions of the marketing department - awareness, acquisition, and retention.</p><h3> It could not be a better time to be a marketer.</h3><p> <br/> Yes, it&rsquo;s more competitive and fast-paced as ever, but the opportunities are endless. When your efforts are balanced across all of the marketing functions - building your brand, driving demand and expanding your customer relationships - you will deliver the kind of uncommon results not possible by simply focusing on a single area of marketing. Uncommon results are good. It means you are doing the best work of your career.</p>",

Do you research a topic (or several topics) to death?</p><p> Are you tracking whatcustomers are saying about your company on social media and other venues through which they can provide feedback?  </p><p> Are you feeling a little bit of data overload? Yet you still keep asking and listening.</p><h3> Keep listening... but hold that thought. </h3><p> <br/> Listening to customers is, without a doubt, important to designing a great experience and to business success. Too many companies, though, forget that the \"work\" doesn't end with listening. It's only just begun!</p><p> By now, you're probably familiar with the Gartner statistic: 95% of companies collect customer feedback, yet only 10% use the feedback to improve, and only 5% tell customers what they are doing in response to what they heard. It's a statistic from years ago, but I believe that it's still representative; companies are still not using feedback to make improvements, but to check a box that says, \"We do that.</p><p> Listening has several parts to it; combined, they all embody the ideal VoC closed-loop initiative, which includes listening, analyzing, acting, and communicating. I previously  <a href=\"http://www.cx-journey.com/2014/09/listen-with-right-intent.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  wrote </a> :</p><p> When we think about a conversation, we typically understand that it has two parts:speaking and listening. It's a two-way street. I would actually add a third component:hearing. Yes, we talk; and yes, we say we listen. But do we actually hear what has been said? I think hearing requires a subsequent action or reaction. And in the customer conversation, that part is often missing.</p><p> When you listen, make sure you hear what is being said before you act or react. When you stop, listen, and really hear, you are better able to understand customers' (or employees', as this applies to both) needs and jobs they are trying to do, allowing you to better design for those jobs or to fulfill those needs. You're also better able to understand their questions or issues and address those or point customers in the right direction to get the issues resolved. In a timely manner.</p><h3> Understanding is key. Listening is critical. Acting is imperative. </h3><p> <br/> The problem? There are those companies, those departments, that just keep listening. And listening. And listening. And then don't ever do anything with what they hear. They just come up with other creative ways to ask their customers questions about the same issues or the same topics. All in the name of listening.</p><p> And then, when they can't listen anymore, they analyze the data to death. How many different ways can we segment and slice it? What other nuggets can we find? This all takes weeks and months - and then the data is old and outdated. So then it's time to, you guessed it, survey again.</p><p> Sound familiar at all?</p><h3> I've seen clients stuck in this vortex. It's not pretty.</h3><p> <br/> What's going on?

    "title": "Immortalizing Your Family Through Heraldry",
    "link": "immortalizing-your-family-through-heraldry",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Matthew Roser</p><h3> The Origin of Heraldic Achievement</h3><p> <br/> Heraldry is the study or art of emblazoning arms with achievement. The true origin of this ancient practice is debated and can be seen in Egyptian artifacts dating from 3100 BC. However, the type of heraldic designs we most commonly associate with in our modern time are of European influence.</p><p> The idea of an inheritable emblem was created in the 12th century during the Norman conquest of England. Henry I of England knighted his son-in-law Geoffrey V, who was bestowed a shield with golden lions. In 1151, this design became the first recorded coat of arms in history and was found on Geoffrey&rsquo;s funerary enamel. By the middle of the 12th century, the practice of an inherited coat of arms became common and widespread across Europe.</p><h3> The Purpose of a Coat of Arms</h3><p> <br/> The original intention of these markings were to distinguish military commanders from common soldiers. Men were often masked by metal helms and quickly became unrecognizable in the thick of battle. Eventually, these gaudy effigies transcended their military distinctions to become short history pieces on valor and family achievement.</p><h3> Why Your Family Should Have its Own Coat of Arms</h3><p> <br/> The coat of arms is a perfect way to visualize your own family&rsquo;s successes and values. Our world is becoming fuller and faster by the minute, and fewer people are maintaining their connection with the generations that preceded them. This type of decoration is a unique way in which your children will proudly carry on your name.</p><p> Although the coat of arms cannot capture every ideal and happy achievement, it rests in a grand, supernatural-like solitude that commands a certain air of awe and respect. Because its origins are rooted in royalty and honor, the coat of arms represents the high morals of love and dignity that accompany a strong family legacy.</p><h3> Components of Heraldic Achievement</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  Dexter and Sinister: </strong> Are the words for right and left in Latin. These refer to the bearer&rsquo;s orientation and not the spectator&rsquo;s.</p><li> <strong>  Motto: </strong> Mottos are generally inscribed in a place above the entire piece or just below it. A motto can be written in any language and is usually an important saying, family name, etc.</li><li> <strong>  Crest: </strong> A &ldquo;family crest&rdquo; is often erroneously confused with a coat of arms. In reality, the crest is an ornament that sits atop a helm, such as a feathery plume, hawk, or other image.</li><li> <strong>  Torse: </strong> A torse is type of twisted fabric that wraps around the top of the helmet and base of the crest. This material was meant to hide the join between the helmet and crest and to also hold the mantling in place.</li><li> <strong>  Mantling: </strong> A drapery tied to the helmet that forms the backdrop for the shield. This type of material may have been used to reduce the wear of sword-blows to the helmet and to also protect the knight from the elements.</li><li> <strong>  Helmet: </strong> The helmet in heraldry symbolizes rank and stature and was not merely of decorative purposes. Differing styles imply a change in rank and military sophistry.</li><li> <strong>  Coronet: </strong> This instrument is similar to a crown, but was only worn by noblemen, whereas a crown is only be worn by kings, queens, emperors, empresses, etc.</li><li> <strong>  Escutcheon: </strong> The escutcheon is a shield in which the coat of arms is displayed. Often the coat of arms was emblazoned on a shield, but could also be found on a surcoat or tabard in the center of an heraldic achievement.</li><li> <strong>  Field: </strong> The entire shield or &ldquo;canvas&rdquo; of the escutcheon is known as the field. This area is compromised of many components such as tinctures (colors). Usually there would be a chief, a band running horizontally across the top of the shield.</li><li> <strong>  Ordinaries: </strong> This area of the escutcheon represents a painted geometric figure such as a cross.</li><li> <strong>  Charges: </strong> Represents some kind of emblem to adorn the coat of arms. This symbol could be a person, tree, sun, etc. A charge may even be an ordinary, such as a cross (or other geometric pattern).</li><li> <strong>  Division: </strong> Divisions are simply lines that divide the different aspects of the escutcheon.</li><li> <strong>  Supporters: </strong> A supporter is a figure that is depicted as holding the escutcheon upright.</li><li> <strong>  Order: </strong> An order may be of an actual party in which the person belongs. These may represent emblems found in a school, police force, military branch, etc.</li><li> <strong>  Compartment: </strong> This area of the heraldic achievement is usually grass, earth, or another depiction in which the shield rests. <br/>  </li><h3> Modern Twists and Variations on Heraldic Achievement</h3><p> <br/> Heraldry has evolved over the centuries and can be seen throughout our daily lives. Gone are the days of knights and noblemen, but the virtues they embodied are still alive and well. Below are some examples of coat of arms designs that depart from tradition:</p><h3> Creating your Own Coat of Arms</h3><p> <br/> Creating your own coat of arms can be a very rewarding experience for you and your family. This type of exercise doesn&rsquo;t have to be restrictive. You can add or omit as many elements as you desire. In fact, you can create new pieces and form the coat of arms in the way that you want.</p><p> There are many artists for hire or maybe one of your family members can start the design themselves. The most important fact is that your family comes together to create this symbol.</p><p> Begin by creating your own escutcheon &mdash; this ornament might be the iconic shield, badge, or some other shape. Then play around with colors that are important to your family to paint the field.</p><p> You can then add symbols or other figures to the coat of arms. Try framing it with some supporters or complete it with a lovely family motto or saying. Emblems and other pieces can be added and removed at will.</p><p> If you are short on ideas, simply search the thousands of examples online or consult with your artist on what kinds of images speak most to your family name. The true purpose of this coat of arms is for it to represent you. And as long as it does that job, it will be able to endure the generations that inherit it.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Everyone knows change is hard.</h3><p> <br/> However, we also recognize that is a necessary part of the work we do. We cannot grow or develop if we do not change.</p><p> Prolonged periods of change can bring fatigue. Change fatigue is the impact of organizations enduring one significant change after another without relent. It is another form of burnout.</p><p> Change fatigue leads to apathy. And eventually, employees move through the changes without really changing. They weather the storms but they do not fully embrace or sustain the new ways or principles conveyed.</p><h3> They fake the funk. And your workplace stinks.</h3><p> <br/> You&rsquo;re trapped in change fatigue. You end up feeling frustrated and confused on why things aren&rsquo;t working as they are designed. And 70% of organizational changes fail because they cannot get beyond the fatigue.</p><p> So if your organization is suffering from change fatigue, here are some things you can do to get over the plateau and get moving again:</p><li> <strong>  Acknowledge it </strong>  &hellip; The first step to overcoming the fatigue of change is recognizing that it exists. We cannot change what we don&rsquo;t admit. Honesty will help your team open up again and be willing to go the next mile with you.</li><li> <strong>  Look back </strong>  &hellip; Change fatigue can only happen where some successful change has occurred. If you hadn&rsquo;t made progress, you wouldn&rsquo;t be tired. Highlight and celebrate the positive milestones.</li><li> <strong>  Change focus </strong>  &hellip; Change fatigue often leads to impasse. Instead of drawing lines in the sand, back up and build new momentum with some easy success. Grab some low-hanging fruit. Identify and solve some less difficult challenges.</li><li> <strong>  Go back </strong> &hellip; Often the goals we set at the beginning of the change have to change as we get into it. New priorities and needs come to the forefront, forcing us to change focus. Take a moment to revisit and resolve issues that got put on the backburner.</li><li> <strong>  Switch up </strong>  &hellip; Working with the same group can get stale. Make a new rotation. Create new project teams to encourage and enable new perspectives to emerge.</li><li> <strong>  Skip ahead </strong> &hellip; Nothing makes it easier to embark on a change when you know the end from the beginning. Move beyond the fatigue by fast-forwarding to the ultimate goal. Define what the results and relationships will be when all the dust settles. Allow freedom for everyone to move toward that goal.</li><li> <strong>  Cut communication </strong>  &hellip; Change fatigue happens when the change is all you talk about. Stop talking about it. Stop encouraging people to accept and embrace the change. The change speaks for itself. Give everyone work to do and let them do it. <br/>  </li><h3> Change fatigue is dangerous.</h3><p> <br/> Failure to recognize and address it can ruin any progress made and keep you from reaching your goals. Stop it in its tracks and keep pressing toward being the best you can be.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SEIJohnA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   John Anderson  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.seic.com/enUS/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   SEI  </u> </a></p><p> I&rsquo;m not taking a complete break from the  <u>  <a href=\"http://seicblogs.com/advisor-practice-management/?s=dol+fiduciary+rule\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   DOL fiduciary rule   </a> </u> this week, but I thought it would be interesting to go back to a broader theme that has also really been a focus for us this year: fees. More specifically,  <u>  Fees at a Crossroads </u> ; the report and webinar that we published and presented in January. Ultimately, I believe the fee discussion is broader than just the DOL; that rule is just accelerating the conversation for many advisors.</p><p> Here are the two very distinct options for advisor compensation that we discussed in the webinar, with some concrete examples:</p><p> <strong>  Option 1: AUM fees </strong> <br/> $500,000 account with 100bps advisory fee = $5,000 in gross revenue</p><p> <strong>  Option 2: Modular fees </strong> <br/> $500,000 account with .25bps investment oversight fee and $950 per quarter advice fee (both deducted from the account) = $5,050 in gross revenue</p><p> You can see that the compensation is relatively the same. Obviously, there are pros and cons to each model, including transparency, ease of use and the fear of ongoing fee discussions. But frankly, both work for many advisors and many advisors will argue with change.  When you look at your current business model and (more often than not) the products you are using, you might be thinking:</p><li> <strong>  With all these discussions around fees, why should I lower my fees, when the products I use don&rsquo;t lower theirs? </strong></li><li> <strong>  If I switch to an all passive strategy, the client will pay less &ndash; so why can&rsquo;t I keep my current pricing? </strong></li><li> <strong>  What if my clients are already complaining about fees and considering moving to a Robo-advisor or virtual advisor platforms for investment advice? </strong> <br/>  </li><p> To answer these questions, I have an analogy that may work &ndash; concierge medicine (also known as retainer medicine).</p><h3> Access vs. product</h3><p> <br/> Concierge medicine is a trend that is rapidly growing in healthcare. Concierge medicine is a direct relationship between a patient and a primary care physician, in which the patient pays an annual fee (or retainer) for access. While the doctor and patient have a better, closer relationship, the patient still pays a separate price for medicine.</p><p> The patient pays for access, advice and knowledge, and the doctor reduces his/her patient load, as well as moves out of the commoditized world of insurance companies and Medicare. That said, the ancillary product (a pill) is not discounted or negotiated. The patient is prescribed what they need and they pay extra for it. Taking it a step further for our analogy, if the medication (or the investment) does not work, the doctor (or the advisor) can move to a different drug (or investment product).</p><p> So how would I answer those earlier questions?</p><h3> <strong>  1. You absolutely should not lower your fees, regardless of the products you use. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Look at the examples above. Both get you to the same gross revenue. Your time, expertise and experience are all worth something &ndash; and only you can determine what it is worth. Either an AUM model or a modular model may work for you, as long as you:</p><li> Understand your value proposition. Go beyond just investing; know your niches and clients</li><li> Can clearly articulate what the client can expect from you</li><li> Demonstrate a service roadmap <br/>  </li><p> Remember, fees come into question only when value is not perceived.</p><p> As for the products, if they add value, they will pay for themselves. The product manufacturers have the R&amp;D costs, the production and the testing. They get their fees for providing the product, not for the advice on how to use it.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Charging an AUM fee to mirror the market invites questions down the road. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Some people truly believe in passive investing &ndash; I get that. But couldn&rsquo;t clients ask why they shouldn&rsquo;t just go to a robo-advisor or direct to a passive fund company? &ldquo;Why do I need you to buy and index? The robos do passive and do it really well and very cheap.&rdquo; Do you want to play that game?</p><h3> <strong>  3. If what clients pay is dependent on the markets and the economy, they are going to associate those costs with your ability to control what you can&rsquo;t. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Again, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you use an AUM model or a modular model, they&rsquo;ll question fees if they don&rsquo;t see value in the relationship. The question itself may be about fees, but the real issue is deeper &ndash; the client thinks he&rsquo;s not getting his money&rsquo;s worth. I think the bigger answer here is to review expectations with the client &ndash; about what you deliver, and about your relationship and your services. Something is missing, and it is manifesting itself through questions about fees.</p><p> Your turn</p><p> Since  <u>  Fees at a Crossroads </u>  debuted in January, this topic has been very hot. I think it will continue to be discussed for a long time. I love the questions, comments and suggestions that we have been getting. Keep them coming.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Last week our office was visited by my friend, investor and author Gianni Kovacevic, who is at the halfway point of a cross-country book tour to promote the latest edition of  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/My-Electrician-Drives-Porsche-Investing/dp/1626342512/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442261437&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=my+electrician+drives+a+porsche\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;My Electrician Drives a Porsche?&rdquo;  </a> </u>  As part of the tour, he&rsquo;s driving a Tesla Model S from Boston to Palo Alto, California&mdash;Tesla&rsquo;s hometown&mdash;to demonstrate the potential of green energy and spread his message that &ldquo;the future is now.&rdquo;</p><p> His book features a successful young man&mdash;the titular electrician, and an analogue of Gianni himself&mdash;who instructs his older family doctor on how to invest in the rise of the new spending class. Not only is &ldquo;Electrician&rdquo; a fact-filled, convincing treatise on the importance of following long-term trends in China, copper and other &ldquo;financial soap operas,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s also a real page-turner. I urge you to grab a copy and check it out.</p><h3> <strong>  Copper: Beneficiary of Unprecedented Number of New Consumers </strong></h3><p> <br/> Central to the book&rsquo;s thesis is a concept that is both simple and yet profound: As the size of the world&rsquo;s middle class continues to grow, demand for &ldquo;things that come with an electrical cord&rdquo; will surge. Below is a brief excerpt:</p><p> My point is that once a group of people make the move from rural to urban, from peasant to worker and on to consumer, their way of life changes. Subsistence disappears from their vocabulary and their lives begin to revolve around the three Cs: comfort, convenience and communication. And in order to achieve any of those things, it takes a whole lot more stuff than ever before. We get a dishwasher to free up time and a television to waste it. We get an air conditioner to stay cool and a heater to stay warm. Then later on, we get other luxuries like solar panels on our roofs and newer, more modern cars. When a society achieves its very own consumer revolution, as China and the developing world are undergoing right now, life becomes less about needs and more about wants. With an unprecedented number of new consumers, these luxuries need way more stuff to make them possible.</p><p> Back in 2014, Microsoft founder and philanthropist  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/21/bill-gates-they-will-be-no-poor-countries-by-2035.html\" target=\"_blank\">   Bill Gates  </a> </u>  predicted that by 2035, there will be &ldquo;almost no poor countries left in the world.&rdquo; You might scoff, but for a moment let&rsquo;s imagine this turns out to be the case. What effect would that have on energy demand? Millions more people joining what Gianni calls the spending class will increase the demand for millions more things&mdash;dishwashers, air conditioners, smartphones, cars&mdash;and necessitate the production of thousands more megawatts of electricity than the world currently generates.</p><p> All of which is a boon for copper. However energy is produced, the red metal is needed for conductivity. In fact,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/8-trillion-alternative-energy-boom-is-a-win-for-copper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   even more copper wiring is used  </a> </u>  in new energy technologies than in traditional sources. An electric car such as the Tesla Model S uses three times as much copper wiring than an internal combustion engine vehicle.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/comm-each-new-generation-of-car-needs-more-copper-wiring-04152016-lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Each New Generation of Car Needs More Copper Wiring\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/comm-each-new-generation-of-car-needs-more-copper-wiring-04152016.gif\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> It was reported this week that China imported 39 percent more copper (and 13 percent more crude oil) in March than in the same time last year, a sign that the Asian giant&rsquo;s appetite for commodities and energy remains strong. Despite a slowdown in GDP growth, China is still the number one importer of metals and number two consumer of oil.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/ENGY-chinas-copper-imports-surge-in-march-04152016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China's Copper Imports Surge in March\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/ENGY-chinas-copper-imports-surge-in-march-04152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> Shipments out of China also rebounded the most in a year, rising 11.5 percent in the first quarter. This suggests its economy fared much better than what analysts were predicting.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/COMM-china-exports-surge-11-5-percent-in-first-quarter-04152016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"China Exports Surge 11.5 Percent in First Quarter\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/COMM-china-exports-surge-11-5-percent-in-first-quarter-04152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> The country&rsquo;s manufacturing industry saw very welcome improvement last month as well, with the purchasing managers&rsquo; index (PMI) coming in at 49.7&mdash;still below the key 50 threshold, but the highest reading since February of last year. The PMI was also above its three-month moving average for the first time since October.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/COMM-chinese-manufacturing-edges-close-to-expansion-04152016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Chinese Manufacturing Edges Close to Expansion\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/COMM-chinese-manufacturing-edges-close-to-expansion-04152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><h3> <strong>  The Rise of the Chinese Spending Class </strong></h3><p> <br/> Consider the dramatic difference in size between college graduates in older and younger Chinese generations. According to Gianni&rsquo;s book, there are 160 million people aged 56 to 65, yet this cohort has only one million graduates. Meanwhile, millennials are 415 million strong&mdash;100 million more than the entirety of the U.S. population&mdash;and of those, 107 million have college degrees. So far. As this number rises, so too will incomes as well as the desire to live a more &ldquo;Western&rdquo; lifestyle filled with stuff.</p><p> <img alt=\"This new generation is not only big in size, but also big in aspirations\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/COMM-higher-standards-gianni-kovacevic-visual-capitalist-infographic-04152016.jpg\"/></p><p> You can check out the entire Visual Capitalist infographic on  <u>  <a href=\"http://kovacevic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Gianni&rsquo;s website.  </a> </u></p><p> The Asian country&rsquo;s middle class is already larger than America&rsquo;s. In October, Credit Suisse reported that there are more than  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/china-then-and-now-in-pictures\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   109 million middle-class consumers in China  </u>  , </a>  compared to 92 million in the U.S.</p><p> <img alt=\"109 Million. For the first time, the size of China's middle class has overtaken the U.S., 109 million compared to 92 million.\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/Chinas-Middle-Class-Overtakes-US-04152016.jpg\"/></p><p> Indeed, domestic consumption in China is following a staggering upward trajectory. In 2015, total retail sales touched a record,  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/10-numbers-to-know-for-the-chinese-new-year\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   surpassing 30 trillion renminbi  </u>  , </a>  or about $4.2 trillion. By 2020, sales are expected to climb to $6.5 trillion, representing 50 percent growth in as little as five years. This growth will &ldquo;roughly equal a market 1.3 times the size of Germany or the United Kingdom,&rdquo; according to the World Economic Forum.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/comm-by-2020-chinese-private-consumption-will-have-grown-2-3-trillion-04152016-lg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"By 2020, Chinese Private Consumption Will Have Grown $2.3 Trillion\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/comm-by-2020-chinese-private-consumption-will-have-grown-2-3-trillion-04152016.png\"/>  <br/>  click to enlarge </a></p><p> The new Chinese spending class is still very concentrated along the country&rsquo;s highly-urbanized eastern coast, in megacities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong and Shenzhen. But this is changing rapidly, with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/mapping-chinas-middle-class\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   39 percent of middle-class growth  </a> </u>  shifting inland toward more rural areas by 2022, according to McKinsey &amp; Company. This will introduce new investment opportunities as these areas will require modern roads, railways and&mdash;most important&mdash;energy infrastructure.  </p><p> <img alt=\"Chinese Middle-Class Growth is Shifting Inland\" src=\"http://www.usfunds.com/media/images/investor-alert/_2016/2016-04-15/COMM-chinese-middle-class-growth-is-shifting-inland-04152016.png\"/></p><p> It&rsquo;s estimated that between 2010 and 2025,  <u>  <a href=\"http://cgsd.columbia.edu/files/2015/10/PolicyBrief-TransportBigData-AndreJonathan1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   300 million Chinese citizens  </a> </u> &mdash;a little less than the entire population of the U.S.&mdash;will migrate from rural areas to cities. As Gianni points out, lifestyles drastically change when this occurs, shifting from one of subsistence to one that revolves around convenience and comfort.</p><h3> <strong>  Tesla Disrupts the Auto Market </strong></h3><p> <br/> Key to this migration is transportation. In 1979, there were only 60 privately-owned automobiles in China. (That&rsquo;s according to a 2006 report by legendary Canadian investment strategist Don Coxe, and cited in &ldquo;My Electrician Drives a Porsche?&rdquo;) Fast forward to today and China is now the world&rsquo;s largest auto market. More than 21.1 million passenger cars were sold in the country last year, a 7.3 percent increase from 2014. Compare that to the U.S., the number two car buyer, where sales totaled 17.5 million, an all-time record.</p><p> By the way, 2015 sales of the Toyota Corolla, one of the top-selling sedans in the U.S., were a little over 350,000. That&rsquo;s slightly more than the number of preorders for the Tesla Model 3, the company&rsquo;s first mass-produced vehicle, within a single week of its unveiling on March 31. In a blog post, Tesla promptly proclaimed it &ldquo;the week that electric vehicles went mainstream.&rdquo;</p><p> The future, as Gianni says, is indeed now</p>",

Now he&rsquo;s a  <a href=\"http://hyken.com/customer-experience-2/guest-post-great-customer-service-looks-like/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  friend. </a></p><p> Sure I had done a lot of speaking before, but only to internal Verizon crowds or to my outsourced call centers where I was &ldquo;the client.&rdquo; This was different&ndash;no built in credibility. I wondered how my message would play outside the safety of my familiar world.</p><p> Shep smiled:</p><p> &ldquo;Great job. When are you leaving Verizon to do this full time?&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;OMG Did I say that from the stage,&rdquo; I cringed, worried I might have inadvertently let out the secret I had yet to admit to myself.</p><p> &ldquo;No. But it&rsquo;s obvious this is what&rsquo;s next for you. Let me know how I can help. You should join the NSA.

    "content": "<h3> Your Top Ten Reasons to do Business With You</h3><p> <br/> Here is a question. Can you give me ten reasons I should do business with you (or your company)? I&rsquo;m talking about good reasons. Reasons that would make me take notice. Reasons that would make you stand out.</p><p> Recently I went through an exercise in my business that helped me focus on why people should do business with me, and you need to know about it&mdash;not the reasons (although I would be happy to share them with you), but the exercise.</p><p> I was listening to an audio program on selling and one of the comments was that any salesperson should be able to comunicate ten compelling reasons to buy their product. As I interpreted this idea, I realized that you don&rsquo;t have to be a salesperson to benefit from this exercise. The ten reasons can be about anything; Why should I buy from you, hire you, promote you, work with you, etc. The list of reasons creates credibility, persuasiveness and even purpose.</p><p> The first thing I did was to make list of reasons. I came up with more than ten. My assistant came up with even more. We had a pretty good list. But some of the reasons were boring&mdash; and everybody else in my business might say some of the same things. The reasons had to be compelling&mdash;and most important&mdash;had to deliver a benefit to my clients.</p><p> So get out some paper and a pen and start creating a compelling list of reasons that will motivate people to take notice of you and your company. Write at least a short descriptive paragraph to expound on what these reasons really mean. My list that was originally a short ten lines long turned into two typewritten pages of compelling story. People&mdash;customers, clients, fellow employees&mdash;want the story. They want the experience.</p><p> A couple of other thoughts&hellip; This doesn&rsquo;t have to be an exercise that you share with others. Creating this list can be just for you. The list can become your personal mission statement. And, the list should be a constant work in progress. I want to keep finding ways to be better. That&rsquo;s good for me as well as my clients.</p><p> As you create your own list, remember what Washington Irving said:  <strong>  &ldquo;Great minds have purposes, others have wishes.&rdquo; </strong></p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrktstrategies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Julia Johnston-Ketterer  </u> </a> | <a href=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Market Strategies International  </u> </a></p><p> The topic of robo-advisors has been part of many of our conversations with subscribers and it has dominated the financial press. Our research has shown that a sizable portion of affluent investors&mdash;those with at least $100,000 in investable assets&mdash;has readily adopted these services, allocating more than  <a href=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/blog/2015/12/robo-advisors-not-just-for-play-money/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  $20 billion of assets to robo-advisors </a> . All told, we can say confidently that robo-advisors are no longer new or emerging&mdash;they have arrived.</p><h3> <strong>  Defining Robo-Advisors </strong></h3><p> <br/> Robo-advisor technology has existed for years and has been leveraged by emerging brands such as Betterment and Wealthfront, which accelerated the growth of the robo-advisor market, as well as legacy brands such as Charles Schwab&rsquo;s quick jump in branding its offering as Intelligent Portfolios. But despite the adoption of these offerings, the industry talk and press, when we began our research we soon understood that there are many definitions of a &ldquo;robo-advisor&rdquo; in the marketplace and that investors may not be familiar with the term. To help facilitate our research process and better understand the term, Cogent provided our survey respondents with this definition:</p><p> &ldquo;Some financial services firms offer a service that provides investment advice based upon sophisticated computerized models, as opposed to either relying on a financial advisor or managing your assets on your own. This type of service is sometimes called a &ldquo;robo-advisor.&rdquo;</p><h3> <strong>  Who Is Using Robo-Advisors and Which Robo-advisor Providers Are They Using? </strong></h3><p> <br/> The big surprise to us was that 30% of affluent investors use robo-advice. Nearly two-thirds of robo-advisor users have assets with legacy brands Fidelity Investments, Vanguard or Charles Schwab, and about one-third with emerging brands such as Folio Investing or Betterment. In our discussions with subscribers about these figures, some are shocked at how high usage is among affluent investors, while others nod their head in agreement. To add fuel to the &ldquo;robo fire,&rdquo; another 22% of affluent investors are likely to consider robo-advice.</p><p> Who are current robo-advisor users?</p><li> More than half (57%) are Gen Xers (31%) or  <a href=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/blog/2015/08/where-are-affluent-millennials-going-for-business-and-financial-news/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Millennials </a>  (26%), which means that the majority of users are age 50 or younger.</li><li> More than half (56%) have investable assets of $100,000 to just under $250,000.</li><li> There is a greater representation within robo-advisor users of  <a href=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/blog/2014/09/women-vs-men-who-is-the-better-navigator/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  females who are the sole financial decision-makers </a>  for their household compared with the overall affluent investor base.</li><li> Finally, 58% work full time and about one in five (19%) are business owners. <br/>  </li><p> <a href=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robo-Usage-and-Likely-Adoption.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Robo-Advisor Usage and Likely Adoption\" height=\"689\" src=\"http://www.marketstrategies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robo-Usage-and-Likely-Adoption.jpg\" width=\"1000\"/> </a></p><p> <i>  Editor&rsquo;s note: Julia Johnston-Ketterer is (Senior Product Director) of Market Strategies International.

    "content": "<h3> International political turmoil, out of control costs, no Olympic Village accommodation, and stark competition facilities: all challenges facing the Olympic athletes heading to Rio this August, right?</h3><p> <br/> Actually, these were just some of the conditions the athletes confronted at the first modern Olympic Games held in Athens, Greece, in April 1896. (The more things change&hellip;)</p><p> Yet, those first Olympians persevered in the face of adverse circumstances and started a legacy, so that now, 120 years later, we are looking forward to the colorful stories, new heroes, and crop of fresh household names that will come from the 2016 Olympic Games.</p><p> Olympic athletes have continued to face circumstances beyond their control, on personal to global scales. One of the most dramatic stories from my own Olympic experiences came in the spring of 1984 when I was with a swim team of world record holders and Olympic hopefuls in Southern California. One day, suddenly our complex was swarming with media, and we didn&rsquo;t know what was happening. We were told to immediately stop our workout and then were quickly herded into the gym, where the doors were locked as soon as we were all inside.</p><p> Choking back the emotion that threatened to overtake him, our coach broke the news that the Soviet Union had just announced they would boycott the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, happening just a few months later. His announcement was met with gasps, shock, and sadness &ndash; after the 1980 boycott by Western countries, yet another Olympics would be marred by politics, and the competition for world titles would remain unresolved because half of the contenders would be absent.</p><p> We were faced with a choice. We could start imagining the compounding issues and follow the disappointment those would generate, allowing our emotions to control our thoughts and destroy our concentration. Or, we could recognize the circumstances, make necessary adjustments, and focus on moving forward with the same drive, attitude, and enthusiasm that enabled us to be the best we could at what we did.</p><p> At times, all of us, whether Olympic athletes or advisors, face challenging circumstances beyond our control. However, you can control your own attitude and reactions in the face of your circumstances. The best athletes and the best advisors consciously choose how they will think and respond, regardless of what others around them are saying or doing.</p><p> What current challenges are tempting you to pay more attention to the problem rather than to finding a solution?</p><p> Robo-advisors, the new DOL ruling, and constant market volatility are just a few of the most recent challenges impacting our industry. Where are you choosing to put your focus? Are you going to add to the negative noise regarding these &ldquo;hindrances&rdquo; and allow yourself to get mentally and emotionally sidetracked? Or, are you going to concentrate on a solution, deciding what next best steps you need to take to most quickly and successfully navigate this change in circumstances?</p><p> Are you fixated on the swirl around you instead of taking new trials in stride? Don&rsquo;t allow immediate challenging circumstances to distract you from focusing on your longer-term objectives.</p><p> When you encounter trials or unexpected changes:</p><li> <strong>  Take time to unemotionally study the situation. </strong>  What exactly is happening, and how are you potentially impacted? What are the best and worst potential consequences of this scenario?</li><li> <strong>  Set quality time to consider appropriate next steps.  </strong> What is the best strategy for navigating through or around this obstacle? Do you need to work on plainly articulating the situation and the solution so you can then clearly explain it to clients, if asked?</li><li> <strong>  Decide what changes you need to make. </strong>  What do you need to anticipate to maximize the opportunities these new circumstances may bring? Is this a timely occasion to make changes in your business?</li><li> <strong>  Take action to make those needed changes. </strong>  Waiting or worrying will not make issues go away. Choose your course of action and move forward. <br/>  </li><h3> Being a professional means absorbing, accommodating, and ultimately adapting to changes over which you have no control.</h3><p> Resist reacting hastily and think clearly. Once you&rsquo;ve identified how best to navigate a challenge, move ahead confidently.</p><p> Aim like an Olympian: Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger)!</p>",

    "content": "<p> It&rsquo;s April 21st, and even if you waited until this year&rsquo;s extended deadline to take care of business, hopefully your taxes are filed and your refund is on its way.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re like most people, your tax-induced anxiety is fading quickly, and you&rsquo;ll happily forget about taxes until next spring.</p><h3> But if you&rsquo;re one of the smarter few, you&rsquo;ll do the exact opposite and celebrate the end of tax season by doing the unexpected: taking a closer look at your 2015 return.</h3><p> <br/> While I&rsquo;m not a CPA, our team reviews about 300 client tax returns annually. In that process, we find that whether they&rsquo;ve been self-prepared or done by a professional, 50% include errors that can result in expensive repercussions&mdash;and not just when the IRS comes knocking at your door. It&rsquo;s why we include tax return reviews as part of the financial planning process, and it&rsquo;s why I urge you to do the same. Here are some specific examples of why looking backward to your 2015 taxes should be at the top of your to-do list:</p><h3> <strong>  Using the IRS as a savings tool offers no real savings at all. </strong></h3><p> <br/> No one will deny that it feels great to get a refund, but planning for that &ldquo;spring bonus&rdquo; to pay down credit cards is a mistake. Melinda was receiving a $3,600 refund each year, so we recommended that she decrease her withholding by filing a new W-4 with her employer and increase her 401(k) contributions by an extra $300 a month. Because her $300 contribution is tax deductible, her actual out-of-pocket cost is just $200 a month. And 10 years from now, she&rsquo;ll be much better off than if she&rsquo;d kept overpaying throughout the year to receive that superficial bonus in April.</p><h3> <strong>  Understating your income can cost you&mdash;a lot. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Missing a 1099Div or 1099B (Schwab&rsquo;s year-end summary)? Track it down, and fast. The IRS gets a copy of these documents, so their computers will nearly always catch missing dividend income before three years is up. When Timothy sent us a copy of his 2015 tax return in March, we saw that he&rsquo;d missed $4,000 in dividends and capital gains. Because we caught the error early, he filed an amended return before April 18 and paid the $1,300 tax before the deadline. If he hadn&rsquo;t asked us to review his return, he would have faced an underpayment penalty plus interest for up to three years, totaling about $500.</p><h3> <strong>  Miscalculating your Schedule D tax basis can increase your taxes. </strong></h3><p> <br/> Richard sent us his 2015 tax return before he filed. Smart man. According to our records, he had sold 100 shares of AT&amp;T for $3,800, but his return reported 35 shares were sold for $3,800, and his tax basis reported was $35. In reality, his tax basis was closer to $2,500, so the capital gain was reduced from $3,755 to $1,300. If the mistake hadn&rsquo;t been corrected, Richard would have also been taxed on more of his social security income. So the mistake had legs. A revised return saves Richard about $500, plus the penalties and interest he would have faced in an audit.</p><h3> <strong>  Your tax documents can expose important planning mistakes&mdash;and opportunities. </strong></h3><p> <br/> When we reviewed Tammy and Jack&rsquo;s return, we investigated some oddly reported dividend income on Schedule B of their 2015 tax return. Although they thought all their stocks were now at Schwab in their joint account and listed as JTWROS (joint tenants with right of survivorship), we discovered that these stocks were with a transfer agent, and they were only in Tammy&rsquo;s maiden name. The stocks were worth $20,000, but if Tammy died, it would cost as much as $5,000 in legal fees to have the assets transferred to Jack. By discovering the oversight, we were able to transfer the shares to their joint Schwab account and avoid a costly mistake in the future. In another example, my client, Tom, asked us to review his father&rsquo;s return after his father passed away. Our review revealed royalty income from oil wells in North Dakota&mdash;a piece of Tom&rsquo;s inherited estate for which there was no other trace. What a nice surprise!</p><h3> Of course, revisiting your taxes is just about the last thing you want to think about at the moment.</h3><p> <br/> But I promise that some diligence today has the potential to bring rewards down the road. All it takes is some attention to detail. Read your return carefully, review it with your CPA, and send us a copy. Ask questions and discuss any life changes that may impact your taxes next year. By digging deeper, you just might put more money in your pocket&mdash;and even reduce your tax-season anxiety altogether.</p> ",

These were perfect examples of how to NEVER sell.</p><h3> <strong>  Event Story </strong></h3><p> <br/> Time was committed on a Saturday to attend the event.  It promised to be a highly creative crowd.</p><p> The problem began and ended with the organizer. &ldquo;Charles&rdquo; was proud of his accomplishments in attracting clientele. His charm faded when he stated, &ldquo;Do marketing like a drug dealer. First attract clients on a low fee, get them hooked, and then keep increasing the price.&rdquo;  What?!</p><p> Next, Charles announced he had a great way for attendees to make extra money. His suggestion was to put a different cover on new books, change the order up of the content, and then slap one&rsquo;s name on the cover. He essentially said copyright laws may be ignored.</p><p> I quickly left the room.</p><h3> <strong>  Vendor Story </strong></h3><p> <br/> I was investigating possibilities for a new phone. Within a few minutes, I knew not to trust the salesman, because he:</p><li> Spoke almost exclusively to my husband while ignoring me</li><li> Avoided my questions</li><li> Purposefully complicated answers <br/>  </li><p> To make matters worse, he treated us as schoolchildren by turning on a meaningless video when another prospective client walked in the door. As soon as he passed across the threshold, we walked out.</p><h3> <strong>  My Story </strong></h3><p> <br/> I have always advocated to build relationships wherever you might be. One never knows whether the person near you might be your next prospect.</p><p> Be polite, be kind, and be helpful.</p><p> By beginning meetings from the other person&rsquo;s perspective, the process of building sound relationships will take root. Leaving your goals behind to help solve the person&rsquo;s problems first will lead to a grateful clientele.</p><p> Over the years, I met strangers who over time became colleagues and friends:</p><li> Jim Beach and I were introduced years ago when he taught entrepreneurship at Stanford. <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://schoolforstartupsradio.com/2016/04/ipo-smooth_sales/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   His AM/FM, School for Startups Radio  </a> </u> , has me featured me as his guest; this is the second time.</li><li> Mary Mora of MGM Speakers, and I met at a networking event many years ago <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1NjeNS1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   The podcast is live here  </a> </u> ; this is the third time as a her guest.</li><li> Donnie Tuttle of Sales Parrot, and I recently met via Twitter <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.salesparrot.com/podcast.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   My guest interview on Donnie&rsquo;s podcast is live here  </a> </u></li><li> NewVoiceMedia, recently sent an email with a request for my articles <br/> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.newvoicemedia.com/blog/seize-the-opportunity-to-take-your-best-shot/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;Seize the Opportunity to Take Your Best Shot&rdquo;  </a> </u>  is now published and promoted to their networks <br/>  </li><p> This is noteworthy because all of these interviews and article posted today!</p><h3> <strong>  Your Story </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Do you leave your goals at the threshold to speak with full attention on the client?</li><li> Are you striving to improve the situation for each client?</li><li> Are testimonials and referrals filling your pipeline? <br/>  </li><p> If you answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any of these questions, take time to seriously consider where improvement may be made.

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Most long-range forecasts of what is technically feasible in future time periods dramatically underestimate the power of future developments because they are based on what I call the &ldquo;intuitive linear&rdquo; view of history rather than the &ldquo;historical exponential&rdquo; view ― Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity is Near</p><h3> <strong>  The Roots of Singularity </strong></h3><p> <br/> An influential group of Futurists think that human intelligence will merge with artificial intelligence, creating a single &ldquo;breed&rdquo; of advanced humans. This train of thought is called: &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo;, and springs from the hope that technology will help us to transcend our biological limitations (like death).</p><p> Singularity isn&rsquo;t new. It was coined by Stanislaw Ulam, a Polish-American scientist who is known for his work on nuclear weapons. In his obituary for his colleague John von Neumann in 1958, he commented on the speed of technological change. He said that its acceleration and societal impact seem to point towards an essential singularity. And the term was born.</p><p> And even before that, in 1908, the world&rsquo;s first futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote a manifest on technological change. Marinetti was a poet and fascinated by the growing importance of industrialization. In the manifest, he rejected the past and celebrated technological progress. Marinetti and his friends insisted that literature will not be overtaken by progress; rather, it will absorb progress in its evolution.</p><p> The idea of progress as scientific advances stems from the enlightenment of the 16th and 17th centuries. French historian and philosopher Voltaire saw science and reason as drivers behind societal advancement. Before the enlightenment, other, divine, world views ruled.</p><p> In our time, Futurist Ray Kurzweil has taken the concept further and predicts singularity to occur around 2045.</p><h3> <strong>  Intense Debate </strong></h3><p> <br/> The concept of singularity isn&rsquo;t new at all, and it&rsquo;s still debatable. The debate mainly revolves around the extent of superintelligence.</p><p> Or rather:  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/review/534871/our-fear-of-artificial-intelligence/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   how exponential will artificial intelligence develop?  </a> </u>  Artificial systems can learn for themselves to recognize cats in photos. But they must be shown hundreds of thousands of examples and still end up much less accurate at spotting cats than a child. Will its advances take five or five hundred years? Both sides, the enthusiasts and the skeptics alike, use trend analysis to prove their points. It&rsquo;s a matter of opinion, not of fact.</p><h3> <strong>  Inequal Distribution of Technology: the Single Singularity </strong></h3><p> <br/> But there are other points to make in the argument. Consider the distribution of science and technology today. Its benefits and costs aren&rsquo;t even equally distributed within countries, let alone globally.</p><p> On top of that,  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2007/RES1010A.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   technological progress has contributed the most to widening income equality  </a> </u> . Meaning that technological advances are reserved for the few, not the many. Hence, singularity may widen the gap even further, which makes it a trend for a super small elite.</p><h3> <strong>  Change Is a Complex Issue </strong></h3><p> <br/> Change takes place on several levels, regions, and time periods.</p><p> The impact of artificial intelligence on an individual can vary between absorption of technology, reduction of its impact, rejection of tech altogether, and avoidance of the issue. Personality and personal preferences, experience, and situational traits like culture determine how individual consumers will respond to smart machines and their impact on how we live, learn, work, and play. This is the field of psychologists, and the discipline studying artificial intelligence is called  <u>  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_psychology\" target=\"_blank\">   Artificial Psychology  </a> </u> . This is what they say:</p><p> As of 2015, the level of artificial intelligence does not approach any threshold where any of the theories or principles of artificial psychology can even be tested, and therefore, artificial psychology remains a largely theoretical discipline.</p><p> In organizations (micro level),  <u>  <a href=\"https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/doleary/intellcont/Artificial%20Intelligence%20Management%20and%20Organizations-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   AI impacts how an organization is structured and what the work processes look like  </a> </u> . Some of the effects of AI on organizations include: power shifts due to the change in ownership of knowledge; reassignment of decision-making responsibility; cost reduction and enhanced service; and personnel shifts and downsizing. This isn&rsquo;t a new insight either. To quote  <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538401/who-will-own-the-robots/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  MIT </a> :</p><p> Worries that rapidly advancing technologies will destroy jobs date back at least to the early 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution in England. In 1821, a few years after the Luddite protests, the British economist David Ricardo fretted about the &ldquo;substitution of machinery for human labour.&rdquo; And in 1930, during the height of the worldwide depression, John Maynard Keynes famously warned about &ldquo;technological unemployment&rdquo; caused by &ldquo;our discovery of means of economising the use of labour.&rdquo; (Keynes, however, quickly added that &ldquo;this is only a temporary phase of maladjustment.&rdquo;)</p><h3> <strong>  Let Science Take over Fiction </strong></h3><p> <br/> So what is the state of robots taking over our jobs? Scientists tend to agree that self-assembling nanobots who work together are most likely to do the heavy lifting.</p><p> 1996 Nobel prize winner in Chemistry Richard Smalley told  <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/400369/will-the-real-nanotech-please-stand-up/page/2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  MIT </a>  that scientists are just beginning to understand the physics of the very small and learn how to control behavior in this realm. His careful words stand in stark contrast with Mr Drexler, chairman of the Palo Alto, CA, based Foresight Institute, who claims that in the future:</p><p> &hellip;self-replicating nanorobots that mechanically push atoms and molecules together to build a wide array of essential materials. Huge numbers of these nanorobots working together would supply the world&rsquo;s materials needs at almost no cost, essentially wiping out hunger and ending pollution from conventional factories.</p><p> Again: predictions of AI&rsquo;s impact on jobs is a matter of opinion:</p><p> A new survey by the Pew Research Center&rsquo;s Internet Project and Elon University&rsquo;s Imagining the Internet Center found that, when asked about the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs, nearly 1,900 experts and other respondents were divided over what to expect 11 years from now.</p><p> Forty-eight percent said robots would kill more jobs than they create, and 52 percent said technology would create more jobs than it destroys.</p><p> Although future narratives like Drexler&rsquo;s help business leaders to envisage possible futures, scientific progress isn&rsquo;t that fast. For that reason, entrepreneurs would do better to use stories to inspire creativity and actual scientific progress for strategy.</p><h3> <strong>  We Don&rsquo;t Have Enough Data to See Patterns Yet </strong></h3><p> <br/> Also on this level of change, we can&rsquo;t generalize how AI will affect a business. Organizational characteristics like job and process design and corporate culture will influence the particular deployment of AI systems. The same system may be deployed differently in different companies and thus have different effects. </p><p> At the transactional level (meso), artificial intelligence will impact how products and services are delivered, and what strategic options an organization has. This is the level that many futurists talk about. For instance:  <u>  AI will transform shops in to experience centers </u>  in the future of retail. </p><p> And then there is the contextual level (macro) consists of &lsquo;global forces&rsquo;, think about: economical developments, demographics, politics, technological developments and social developments. In this area even less is known. Science develops from observations and questions, which in turn form scientific theories that need to be questioned, and those theories put together form a field. At this point, we&rsquo;re only starting to observe.</p><p> The research on the effects of AI on all levels has only just begun. In December 2014,  <u>  Stanford University announced a 100 year study </u> . The study will look into everything from the impact artificial intelligence will have on law and democracy to economics and warfare. It also will focus on individual reactions to intelligent machines.</p><h3> <strong>  Strategize Specifically </strong></h3><p> <br/> During the centuries, people have had the same array of responses to change. The aggregated effects of all those individual responses differ per time period, region, and culture. In ancient times, the Greek invented the scientific method and started many modern scientific disciplies. Then came the dark ages for Europe, but other civilizations kept using a scientific method intensively.</p><p> Today is no different. Science and technology aren&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t be equally dispersed. Your response to change must depend on your business environment and market. The one thing to remember is that strategy should be dynamic. The business environment will change, and so should your strategy. AI will impact that environment, but when and how is yet to be seen.</p><p> Keep the business stable, monitor change, and use flexible growth strategies.</p>  ",

    "content": "<p> If you&rsquo;re a marketer, you know better than anyone you&rsquo;ve got to spend money to make money. In order to get any message out to the masses, man (or woman) power needs to be employed, materials developed, tools implemented, and so so forth. If you have a home run marketing strategy, you&rsquo;re going to need a proper budget to achieve stellar results. Yet convincing a frugal a client or CEO to agree to the necessary capital is often an uphill battle.</p><h3> Psychological Hacks to Capture Marketing Capital <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Ask for a bigger budget </strong></h3><p> <br/> This hack may seem counterintuitive, but often does the trick. By approaching the moneyman with a proposal that is around three times what is actually needed, it will surely get shot down. You can then ask for the actual budget desired and it will seem reasonable in comparison. It is more likely for them to grant your request after denying a much larger one. This is the grand art of negotiation. Do make sure you have a plan in place for both, however, as you don&rsquo;t want to get caught with your pants down if the big budget shocks you with a green light.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Sit next to the opposition </strong></h3><p> <br/> This one is subtle but effective. If there is someone you expect to be combative on the budget, sit right next to them before the meeting starts. This often times will cause the individual to lose their edge, considering your close proximity. Being across the table give a person the space and comfort needed to flex their muscles. This stance almost asks for a conflict. Don&rsquo;t let this happen. At the very least a side by side discussion will help to minimize their will to fight.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Write with confidence </strong></h3><p> <br/> Here is something that should be common sense, but is frequently overlooked. When writing or pitching your proposal, don&rsquo;t let the words &ldquo;I believe&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think&rdquo; ever pass your lips. This is already implied, but expressing these words displays a lack of confidence. Treat this like a job interview; you&rsquo;re confident in your proposal and know it is the right plan of action. Let that seep through in the words you use.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Socialize the plan </strong></h3><p> <br/> In most scenarios a team is much stronger in numbers. By socializing the strategy amongst your team, and possibly even the VP or CFO, it is much more feasible to gain approval with group consensus. Mass mentality is a powerful weapon.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Use silence strategically </strong></h3><p> <br/> Anyone who has seen the film remembers  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1E2cYCcn64\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   this infamous scene from the movie Pulp Fiction  </a> </u> ; silences make people uncomfortable. Use this awkwardness to your advantage. If you are encountering a great deal of resistance, remain calm and stay somewhat silent. More times than not, the other person will become uneasy, which makes them more willing to break the dead air and give up a key point.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> With Americans living longer than ever before, we have the opportunity to be successful in our original career, and then embark on a new venture. For some of us that means scaling back to part-time work or retiring from the professional scene completely. For others, it means starting up a new business, or exploring a new field.</p><p> Whatever Act 2 looks like for you, building financial stability now is a key ingredient in having flexibility later.</p><p> Two ingredients that foster financial stability are an essential part of the financial planning process: Clarity and simplicity.</p><li> Clarity: To build your financial reserve, you should expect to work with a financial planner who can explain your options clearly and help you make smart financial decisions.</li><li> Simplicity: This is a powerful concept when applied to personal finance and money management. When your financial planner demystifies complex issues such as investments, taxes, and retirement, you can make better decisions with confidence. <br/>  </li><h3> Integration trumps consolidation every time!</h3><p> <br/> A Certified Financial Planner professional can help you integrate your investment holdings and coordinate your financial life. Having clarity about your financial situation yields confidence and peace of mind.</p><p> Some clients may incorrectly associate the number of accounts they have with diversification; the number of relationships they have with financial advisors does not mean they are diversified. Yes, it&rsquo;s important to consolidate, but it&rsquo;s more important to integrate your financial life.</p><p> You should consolidate so that you don&rsquo;t have multiple relationships to manage. But the real reason to consolidate is to integrate the pieces of your financial life.</p><p> It&rsquo;s not that consolidation is bad&mdash;of course we need to automate to save time and be efficient&mdash;but if you&rsquo;re nervous about the mutual funds that you have selected or you&rsquo;re uncertain about the investment allocation of your 401(k) plan, then you may need to revisit your strategy.</p><p> Start by partnering with a financial planner who will help you focus on your priorities and goals. It is not enough to identify goals and implement a plan; monitoring your progress underpins the foundation of ongoing financial advice and goal-tracking.</p><p> One way I help my clients organize their finances is by investing heavily in software and technology. My clients can access all of their financial information any time, anywhere, on any device. Not only can they view their investments that our firm helps them manage, but they can also see their 401(k) plans, savings accounts, and even liabilities on any phone, any tablet, any computer&mdash;Windows, Apple, Android.</p><p> That&rsquo;s simplicity at work! The organization and clarity is appealing regardless of age, gender, or level of wealth. Whether they&rsquo;re Millennials or Boomers, they want to see their holdings online, integrated, in one place.</p><h3> Choose a financial planner who can help you see the big picture.</h3><p> <br/> Sometimes I sit down with a client right by my side and re-balance their portfolio&mdash;real time, right in front of them. Due to compliance requirements, they log in and control the keyboard. Of course some prefer that I walk them through it over the phone. Clients appreciate that I work with them in the way that makes them feel most comfortable, and that they can finally cross this important task off their to-do list. They leave our meeting or end the phone call feeling positive about their financial future.</p><p> One simple way I help clients consolidate and integrate is by encouraging them to automate their credit card payments. So many clients travel, and they sometimes forget to pay their credit card bill. I tell them, &ldquo;Automate that payment so that you pay the minimum amount due every month. And then you can pay off the credit card in full when you return or when you remember.&rdquo;</p><p> They have the money; they&rsquo;re just really busy. So automating helps them save the $30 late fee.</p><p> Scroll down for five reasons to integrate&mdash;by automating and consolidating&mdash;your finances. That way when you&rsquo;re ready to move into Act 2 of your life, your finances will be ready for your next venture, too.</p><h3> <strong>  1. Consolidate financial accounts to reduce paperwork.  </strong></h3><p> <br/> The goal is for all of your banking and brokerage activity to be at the institution where your deposits and investments are. That way, you will receive just one statement detailing all of your holdings and the activity associated with each.</p><p> Remember: The number of accounts does not determine one&rsquo;s level of diversification. You could have 10 accounts at different institutions and still not be properly diversified.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Automate to more easily manage your monthly cash flows. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Direct deposit of paychecks, pensions, etc.</li><li> Automatic sweeps to interest-bearing accounts mean less idle money.</li><li> Checks and credit card activity are summarized in one monthly statement.</li><li> Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) from retirement accounts at age 70.5 can be deposited directly into your checking account, with federal tax withholding. Federal tax withholding is not automatic, but can be arranged. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  3. Automate to reduce the chance of errors. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> All assets can be viewed and analyzed in one view.</li><li> Individual investment holdings are easier to monitor.</li><li> Investment returns are easier to evaluate.</li><li> Portfolio re-balancing is easier to implement. <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  4. Automate to simplify tax preparation and record-keeping. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> One source for 1099s, capital gains, dividends, and interest.</li><li> Check-writing and debit card activity is categorized and summarized.</li><li> Maintenance of cost-basis information and other historical information.</li><li> Some tax software allows importing information directly from financial institutions (talk about saving time and reducing errors!). <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  5. Consolidate to centralize estate administration, in the event of disability of death. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> In the event of death, every institution that holds the decedent&rsquo;s assets will require one set of documents: <li>  Death certificate dated 60 days or less from date of death </li> <li>  Affidavit of domicile </li> <li>  Last will and testament and any codicils </li> <li>  Revocable Living Trust and any amendments </li> <li>  Advance Medical Directive/Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care </li> <li>  Durable Power of Attorney  <br/>    </li></li><li> If the decedent owned a business, then copies or originals of the following documents will be required: <li>  Corporate, LLC, or partnership documents </li> <li>  Contract, including leases, loans, and employment agreements </li> <li>  Business licenses, such as state and local licenses </li> <li>  Income tax records for the most recent three years  <br/>    </li></li><li> Benefits of centralized estate administration include: <li>  One source for all requirements. </li> <li>  One phone call and an experienced, dedicated specialist to help. </li> <li>  Continuity of management and custody services.  <br/>    </li></li><p> As a financial planner, it&rsquo;s extremely comforting knowing that I&rsquo;m helping my clients prepare to send their children off to college, save money to cover wedding expenses, and even be able to have one less worry if they have to face an unexpected loss or illness.</p><p> Whatever shape your Act 2 takes, I hope it will be fun, fulfilling, and financially secure!</p>",

    "link": "ten-ways-to-stand-out-at-work",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> New to your job? Seeking a promotion? Needing to be noticed? It is important for people to feel satisfied at work, where so much of life is spent.</p><h3> But sometimes, it takes a little extra effort to find the recognition you desire at work. Adopting the following 10 habits will help you to stand out at work, and experience greater fulfillment and job security as you do:</h3><h3> <br/> <strong>  1. Look the part </strong></h3><p> <br/> Physical appearance matters. It is important to dress the part of the professional that you want to be recognized as. Take some extra time in grooming and selecting and ironing clothing that command the respect and recognition that you are seeking.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Show support for the company </strong></h3><p> <br/> Take time to consider what you like and even love about your company, and make a conscious effort to focus on those elements as you face your work day. No matter what, never badmouth your employer. Not only will it breed negativity within you, but you never know who will repeat what you have said. Rather, be a cheerleader for your company.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Immerse yourself in the culture </strong></h3><p> <br/> Companies have a culture in and of themselves. Become a part of it. Attend company events, play on company teams, and show your enthusiasm as you do so. You will quickly begin to stand out as a team-player who is committed to the company.</p><h3> <strong>  4. Consistently offer help </strong></h3><p> <br/> Look for ways that you can help &ndash; even if it means making someone else look better. Volunteer for the committees and responsibilities that others may not want to do. Again, you will be recognized as someone who cares about the company, its employees, and its overall output.</p><h3> <strong>  5. Care about your coworkers </strong></h3><p> <br/> Get to know your coworkers. Find out who matters to them. Ask them about their family members &ndash; by name. It will show that you care and that you are not simply showing up to receive a paycheck, but that you want to be part of the company and its people.</p><h3> <strong>  6. Do more than your job requires </strong></h3><p> <br/> Avoid simply checking off what is required of you before checking out for the day. Develop a habit of looking for small ways to contribute above and beyond what is asked of you in your job description. Don&rsquo;t wait to be asked; just do it. Your company and co-workers will be impressed, and over time, they&rsquo;ll notice your extra contribution.</p><h3> <strong>  7. Offer solutions </strong></h3><p> <br/> Be solution-driven. If you or other coworkers identify problems, be somebody who develops and voices solutions, especially in company meetings. You will find personal gratification as you contribute to the betterment of your coworkers, your company, and its clients, and you&rsquo;ll stand out for it.</p><h3> <strong>  8. Model enthusiasm </strong></h3><p> <br/> Enthusiasm can be infectious. Showing that you are happy &ndash; even excited &ndash; about the work that you do will make people want to work with you and interact with you. You will likely be trusted with more because of your attitude.</p><h3> <strong>  9. Work harder </strong></h3><p> <br/> Look around your place of work.

    "title": "Decision Making: Simple Rules to Improve Analytics and Intuition",
    "link": "decision-making-simple-rules-to-improve-analytics-and-intuition",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The increased use of analytics versus intuition in decision-making has been significant in improving the understanding and results of decision-making. <br/>  </h3><p> The growth has been particularly affected by the growth and confidence in behavioral economics fostered by authors like Daniel Hahnemann, Richard Thaler, and Michael Lewis. This article argues that there is no simple resolution, but there are simple rules to improve the decision process with both.</p><p> A great example of the tradeoff occurred several decades ago, when a poultry equipment company I was consulting with was moving their facilities from Michigan to Georgia to save money before everyone went to China. They had engineers analyze every phase of the manufacturing process, and successfully moved everything, with only a few people, to the Georgia facility.</p><p> When they shipped their first order, the installation manager called and said everything is great, except there is nothing to put the cages together with. The bottom line of the story is that the last step of shipping an order was the shipping manager grabbing handfuls of screws and nails etc. and just putting them in the shipment based on his intuition. They were never in the specs and thus never written down and his intuition had always been accurate.</p><p> Analytics is simply the increased use of models, probability, risk, numbers, and analysis to improve decision-making. In some simple cases, it has proved to be a valuable tool to understand and improve decisions or simply validate prior intuition &ndash; particularly, where there are lots of stability and historical data. For example, we have significantly improved results by helping clients focus on the 20 percent of customers or products that account for 80 percent of the sales. </p><br /><p> As the bias switches from &ldquo;we have always done it that way&rdquo; to analytics, it can become easy to underestimate the value of intuition.</p><p> It is generally fast, experienced-based, and actually considers many factors (like the screws in the example above) that analysis often misses. It is almost required in cases where change, instability, uncertainty, and creativity are present. As George Bernard Shaw said, &ldquo;The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.&rdquo; Similarly Steve Jobs said if he asked customers what they wanted, it be obsolete before he got it on the shelves.</p><p> There are two statistical concepts &ndash; regression to the mean versus outliers &ndash; that illustrate intuition versus analytics. Simply stated, regression to the mean says the odds are very slim at winning the lottery. An outlier is someone does win despite the odds. Most people spend lots of energy trying to be an outlier.</p><p> Our approach is to consider both approaches, and consider the appropriateness and effectiveness in each situation. Some simple tips are:</p><li> The greater the certainty, the more analytics can improve decisions. The greater the uncertainty, the more intuition is necessary to at least develop alternatives.</li><li> Intuition is essential in developing ideas and hypotheses. In contrast, analytics can be especially useful in analyzing results and developing new modifications.</li><li> In using analytics, be sure to consider the validity of the data, sample size, bias, uncertainty, and risk in making decisions that can undermine the use of analytics.</li><li> Remember the analytics are only as good as the least reliable variable. You need to understand the dynamics of how volume, price, and profit interact with marketing models. You can&rsquo;t make it up with volume if you lose money on every transaction.</li><li> In using intuition consider how change, demographics, and the environment can affect tried and true beliefs.</li><li> Develop simple models like our profitability model that allow you to analyze the interaction of various factors with different intuitive alternatives.</li><li> In summary, the most important aspect of this discussion is to understand the use of analytics versus intuition in your decision processes. The assumptions, results, effort, and process can be greatly aided. In general more analytics is generally useful for small businesses; however, one must be sure the foundation, reliability, data, and processes of the analytics have a firm base.</li>",

    "content": "<h3> How many times has a requisition(s) for a new department, acquisition or project been dropped on your desk with the expectation of you walking on water and moving mountains to fill them immediately? <br/>  </h3><p> Over the course of my career, this has happened to me countless times. Sometimes, I had great news for my hiring managers and other times I had nothing for them.</p><p> Those of us who have been in Talent Acquisition and/or Recruitment roles for a while know that there was a space and time where you would source your heart out against regularly-filled requisitions to amass a database of names. These were people you could put to work when opportunities arose. You were able to do this because you had some inkling or clue as to what the needs would be in the future.</p><p> Fast forward to now, the wants, needs, and priorities of today&rsquo;s candidates are ever-changing. This makes the concept of casting a wide net, baiting and catching anyone who can breathe; an archaic modus operandi for recruitment.</p><p> I&rsquo;m not sure when someone in HR or otherwise made a collective decision to shut recruitment out of workforce planning discussions &ndash; but it happened. Suddenly, every requisition is a new awakening and you are in a just-in-time mode &ndash; satisfying as many of your requisitions as possible in an absurd amount of time.</p><h3> What&rsquo;s the problem with &ldquo;Just-In-Time&rdquo; Recruitment? <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s a shortlist: </strong></p><li> It&rsquo;s reactive versus proactive.</li><li> It becomes hard to focus on quality when your sole objective is to fill a requisition.</li><li> It creates a further divide between what is needed by the organization and the potential value Talent Acquisition can provide.</li><li> <p>  From a business strategy perspective, any solid or potential plans for expansion, acquisition, joint ventures etc. should be discussed with your recruitment  team. If they know what is coming down the pike they can better strategize and ensure that optimal levels of staff are achieved. </p></li><p> <strong>  It&rsquo;s called&hellip;workforce planning </strong></p><p> The ideal scenario is: You, the owner of the organization or member of the C-Suite decides where the business goes next. In turn, we proactively work with you to see that you have reasonable timelines established for the recruitment process and a strategy for hiring and on-boarding people properly so they start off on the right foot.</p><p> Step it up, TA Managers!</p><p> Additionally, talent acquisition managers have to be strong enough to force their way into those conversations in the first place. There&rsquo;s nothing more infuriating to recruiters than having a TA manager who sits idly by; while the organization sets them up to fail with last minute requests for bulk hiring. If you are a TA lead or manager, it is your job to set reasonable expectations for what your team can accomplish given the time and resources that are allotted.</p><p> If you say nothing and accept it, the entire organization expects that you and your team are on-demand entities ready to funnel them candidates no matter what they throw at you.</p><h3> Here are some tips on how you can get out of the Just-In-Time rut: <br/>  </h3><li> Push back on unreasonable timelines and expectations for staffing when they arise.Educate your internal partners about why the timeline and/or requests are unreasonable and provide timely alternatives for them.</li><li> Get your recruitment team in operational meetings so they have a global view of future hiring needs. Rotate team members at these meetings and have them come back and debrief the other recruiters on the state of affairs.</li><li> Map out a timeline and create a plan for expansions, acquisitions and projects so every recruiter can take stock of what they have and plan their recruitment efforts accordingly.This will allow for a more proactive approach to the support you provide and set the team up for success.</li><li> If you really want to be progressive, rate your hiring managers on their time and ability to anticipate staffing shortages. When Just-In-Time requests start to affect their performance ratings and increases, you will be likely to see less of this. Accountability wins every time.</li>",

    "link": "seo-should-you-do-it-yourself-or-hire-a-pro",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> If you have a website and want to increase traffic (and ultimately sells), then professional SEO services are a serious business necessity. You can either hire someone to do it for you or choose to learn and do it yourself. </p><p> Which is best?</p><p> The answer is completely dependent on how your website performs currently as well as competition levels in your industry.</p><p> If you are going into highly competitive markets such as health, weight loss, or financial services, then you need to realize that this is going to be extremely difficult.</p><p> This leaves you with three options&hellip;</p><h3> #1: Learn SEO Yourself <br/>  </h3><p> SEO has advanced more in the past several years than ever before. Consequently, learning SEO yourself will take hours upon hours of research, practice, and perfection. And that&rsquo;s just the &ldquo;pre-process&rdquo; to learning what actually works and doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p> After this basic &ldquo;SEO research&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll have to take what you learned and build your own SEO plan for your site. The better and more detailed a plan, the better results you&rsquo;ll get.</p><p> When you have a solid plan, the next step is implementing it.</p><p> For highly competitive keywords, this often means a copious amount of time consuming work.</p><p> And to top of all of this, if you&rsquo;re new to SEO you don&rsquo;t even know if your plan will work!</p><p> While SEO is a great skill to know, if you&rsquo;re the business owner or manager of all marketing activities, your time should better be spent elsewhere.</p><p> The one exception where doing SEO yourself may work out fine is if your industry is lacking in high authority competitors with strong SEO.</p><h3> #2: Hire an In-House Expert <br/>  </h3><p> With the rising popularity of SEO services and consulting, the demand for in-house SEO experts has exploded.</p><p> These days, a $50,000 salary can buy you an in-house SEO &ldquo;expert&rdquo; at a fraction of what a top agency or consultant would charge.</p><p> But will this in-house expert deliver?</p><p> This is the risk you face when hiring an in-house expert. Not only do you have to make sure they know what they&rsquo;re talking about, but they need to deliver results.</p><p> If you&rsquo;re looking for a real SEO &ldquo;expert&rdquo; that can generate page 1 rankings for highly competitive keywords, you can expect to pay well over $50k a year. What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;ll likely require copious other contracted resources to accomplish this.</p><p> That includes hiring quality writers, designers, and link builders.</p><p> This added workload can add up quick. And even if you get lucky and find a $50k SEO expert, you&rsquo;ll likely spend another $50k on freelance work.</p><p> While hiring an SEO expert in-house is rather risky, there are a few scenarios where it may make sense:</p><li> When you&rsquo;re building an in-house digital marketing team (an SEO expert is a key player to any digital team)</li><li> If your industry is of low to medium competition, allowing you to hire a medium-level expert rather than a top-level one</li><li> If you are looking to invest heavily in a long-term growth strategy <br/>  </li><h3>  #3: Outsource Your SEO <br/>  </h3><p> While it may seem cheaper to learn SEO yourself or hire an in-house expert, you&rsquo;d be surprised to find out how much time and resources these two options can consume.</p><p> For this reason, choosing professional SEO services is often the money and time saver in the long run.</p><p> While these services are quite expensive, they usually deliver great results for getting your site visible in the search engines.</p><h3> So What Should You Expect From a Professional SEO Service? <br/>  </h3><p> When you hire a professional SEO company or consultant, what they will often do is first build an outline of what is needed. Often your website needs tweaks on page before work can be done for the fastest results.</p><p> After this, a general outline of a list of keywords to target is built.</p><p> This ranges from difficult keywords that will take months to rank for and easier keywords that can reach page one in weeks to months (depending on how your website is perceived by search engines currently).</p><p> The more professional the service, the more detailed this outline will be. The more keywords they target, the more traffic you will likely rank for.</p><p> The mistake many newbies make with their websites is targeting only a couple keywords. And, of course, these couple of keywords are often the most difficult to rank for.</p><p> Your first bet is to find keywords that will get what you want. Most people go for any keyword that is related to their site and has a high search count. While this is fine for traffic, the people searching for that keyword may not be best fit for your site. You may be better off using what are called long-tail keywords (terms with less search volume but more interest in what you&rsquo;re selling).</p><p> In general, the more money you pay for professional SEO services, the better results you get. I made the terrible mistake when first starting out by trying to hire an $8 per hour &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in India for SEO. They agreed for a couple hundred dollar contract and built thousands of black-hat links.</p><p> This not only got my website nowhere in search results, it led to numerous penalties that made SEO infinitely harder.</p><p> Proper SEO takes time , effort, and resources. The more of all three of these used, the faster and more effective the results.</p><p> Using low cost services means that the person your hiring will have to cut down on their use of these three necessities. As a result, they will often produce less effective results than those that can use the extra funds for more quality link-building.</p><h3> Do Not Use Professional SEO Services Unless You Have a Solid ROI <br/>  </h3><p> Since professional SEO services are so expensive, I advise to not even touch these services unless you have a solid, tested and effective marketing system for your website that converts customers.</p><p> What&rsquo;s the point spending thousands of dollars on services if no amount of traffic will convert into sales?</p>",

    "content": "<h3> For the third time this month I got an EVENT invitation on Facebook from a woman who does in person, divorce recovery workshops&hellip; in MICHIGAN!</h3>You would think that the fact I am blissfully married and live in Colorado, I would be eliminated from the list of people this woman markets to, but it doesn&rsquo;t.She is just blasting her crap to the wind.This kind of marketing causes us all to want to scream and delete everyone&rsquo;s invitations. Facebook allows you to &ldquo;add targeting&rdquo; your events, but most choose to ignore that and they send their invitations to the world.This morning I followed someone back on Twitter, who had followed me last week. Immediately I got the following tweet (Identity has been hidden to protect the ignorant):<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Annoying-Twitter-Welcome-Message1.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Annoying Twitter welcome message, get better results with social media\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Annoying-Twitter-Welcome-Message1.jpg \" width=\"523\"/></a>Not very personal, considering it&rsquo;s WHAT WE DO! Duh!If this guy had spent five seconds reading my bio or a few tweets, he would know not to send that message (even though it was surely one of those annoying auto-generated messages that make it even worse).<h3> Social Media has shifted</h3>It&rsquo;s not actually social media that has shifted, it is the audience who has grown weary of the over-hyped, and irrelevant crap we get in our news feeds, Twitter streams and everywhere else we try to hide from bad marketing. If you want people to listen to you and want to learn more about the services or products you offer, you have to first get personal!Getting personal requires you spend a little more time listening and actually having conversations with people on your social media sites.  It requires a little more humanness &ndash;a little less automation. Right there I saw most of your eyeballs roll in the back of your head as you thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have more time to listen and I need MORE automation to get all of this done in a day.&rdquo; And the reality is most of you won&rsquo;t change the way you are marketing and most of your community members will continue to ignore the generic marketing messages you keep pumping out each day.It&rsquo;s almost as if everyone was given a social media quota and as long as you push out one Facebook post and two tweets every day, you can check it off of your list. You are wasting time doing it that way. The first word in social media is SOCIAL.<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SOCIAL-definition.jpg \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"what is social media, how to do social right, social marketing\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SOCIAL-definition.jpg \" width=\"442\"/></a>LIKING TO BE WITH AND TALK TO PEOPLE ~ I don&rsquo;t see where social means, the act of forcing people to read all about you and how great your business is. Remember, people do business with people they LIKE!Look for ways this week to be less self-promoting, more helpful (even if it&rsquo;s not a sales opportunity), and get a bit more personal with your social media community.<h3> Here are 3 tips for you to focus on this week to be a bit more likeable and SOCIAL:</h3><h3> 1. Listen to strategic conversations</h3>(Use saved search queries for your industry or key phrases your target market may be using in their Twitter conversations. These are wonderful, and natural places for you to listen to others, jump in and provide helpful information and value without coming across as a sleazy sales person!<h3> 2. Use geo-fencing if you are a local business</h3>You will find this feature in any third-party app such as Hootsuite or Sprout Social.  Twitter also has it and most people don&rsquo;t know about it. Go to<u> <a href=\"http://Twitter.com/search-advanced\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  http://Twitter.com/search-advanced </a></u>and click NEAR THIS PLACE. It will pull all tweets coming from people near you. A great tool for realtors, restaurants, hotels and anyone wanting to connect with locals.<h3> 3. Commit 30 minutes to an hour each day engaging in other people&rsquo;s conversations</h3>Whether you are using Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, etc. to build community and relationships with people you have to spend time liking, commenting and sharing things they are talking about. Just try it for one week. Spend more time on other people&rsquo;s profiles that you do pumping out content on your own and see what transpires!",

    "title": "5 Simple Ideas to Streamline Your Advisory Firm",
    "link": "5-simple-ideas-to-streamline-your-advisory-firm",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Linda Brink </u></p><p> There is so much to do in an advisory firm &ndash; following the markets and keeping up on economic developments, responding to client inquiries or preparing for client meetings and events, hiring and developing employees, working on the marketing message, ensuring technology is up-to-date&hellip;</p><p> Lots to do and, most weeks, seemingly little time to do it in.</p><p> Sometimes a firm can evolve into the fire drill mentality, where people are just running from one fire to another and trying to address the urgent, knowing they should focus on the less urgent, but having no time to do so. Things are getting done but people are worrying and wondering what&rsquo;s being missed. Employees have less restful sleep at night, and can become very stressed and agitated during the day. While the work gets done, no one is at a high level of productivity and effectiveness &ndash; they can&rsquo;t be.</p><p> If this sounds like your firm, or the one you work in, it might be time to consider making a change. When things are just spiraling and you have to take the time to stop and figure out a better way, it can feel like changing your clothes in the back of a pickup truck barreling down the highway. You are trying to keep your balance and not fall off, but get the new clothes on in time for the party you are racing to! Unfortunately when the fire drill mentality gets embedded, it&rsquo;s very hard to remove without some sort of concerted focus and effort. Things won&rsquo;t change on their own; it will take you to say &ldquo;stop the madness!&rdquo;</p><h3> What does this mean? Here are five ideas to streamline your firm: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Take time to examine what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not <br/>  </h3><p> Yes, that&rsquo;s right &ndash; in the midst of having too much to do and not enough time to do it, take more time out of the craziness to do a review. You can&rsquo;t change what&rsquo;s happening without an opportunity to step outside of it and view it objectively. Your team sees things every day that you might not even know are happening. When people get into fire drill mode, they cease to stop and ask, &ldquo;What should I be doing right now?&rdquo; Schedule an informal place, away from the office if possible, to review what&rsquo;s going on and what can be changed.</p><h3> 2. Review your processes and associated technology <br/>  </h3><p> This is often where economies can be made. What is your team still doing manually? How many systems does an advisor have to go to in order to create a client report? Does everyone who needs it, have access to client information? Actively seek those places where technology could be better utilized.</p><h3> 3. Confirm that the right people are in the right roles <br/>  </h3><p> So much time and energy is wasted when people are in ill-fitting roles. They have to work much harder in order to be successful, because the fit is not natural and comfortable. If you are asking financial people to sell, for example, do they have the skills, the knowledge and the tools to do so? If you are asking low-rules people to play a compliance role, do they have the aptitude to find errors? Align people with their natural talents and the work is much easier for them.</p><h3> 4. Align expectations with the role <br/>  </h3><p> In many advisory firms, the tendency is to have an &ldquo;all hands on deck&rdquo; mentality; anyone who is breathing may be asked to do anything at any time! It&rsquo;s great to have people who will pitch in, but it&rsquo;s not efficient. Streamlining happens when people are accountable, own their roles and responsibilities, and know what to depend on from others. The fire drill environment breeds the &ldquo;do whatever you can&rdquo; approach, and it actually makes everything more complicated, not less.</p><h3> 5. Be willing to change <br/>  </h3><p> Some leaders thrive on chaos. Yes, it is largely ineffective; yes, it burns people out; and yes, it rarely allows a firm to gel, but it is the preferred style of many leaders. There is a fine line between entrepreneurial, which may be creative and change-focused, and chaos, which has no real rhyme or reason and changes continually just to shake things up. Be willing to be self-reflective and consider whether your leadership style is part of the problem. You will be better off in the short and long term with a streamlined firm that is moving in the right direction as efficiently as humanly possible!</p>",

    "link": "the-secret-behind-how-the-new-york-times-creates-viral-articles",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: Robby Smith |  From the <a href=\"http://www.scienceofpeople.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   Science of People  </u> </a></p><p> Have you ever wondered what makes a story so compelling? Or why certain stories go viral?</p><p> At the Science of People, we were curious and wanted to know the true ingredient of a powerful story. This led us on a discovery to explore one of the largest organizations people can rely on for a great story, the New York Times (aka NYT).</p><h3> One of the Largest <br/>  </h3><p> The New York Times is a media giant. It is not only an industry leader on digital platforms (second highest in digital trafficking), but also one of the highest in regards to traditional newspaper circulation. Since September 15, 1851, NYT has won 117 Pulitzer Prizes&ndash;more than any other news organization.</p><p> And digitally, they have it dialed in. On Aug. 6, 2015, NYT became the lone digital-only company to reach the one million mark for digital subscribers. Check out their insane growth:</p><br /><h3> Most Emailed <br/>  </h3><p> Ok, NYT is huge&mdash;how can we learn from them? The New York Times is a leading engineer in storytelling. Nothing they do is by accident. We wanted to know which kinds of articles go viral. The NYT aggregates their most popular articles in a specific tab. This makes it easy to see the trending articles.</p><p> <strong>  The Most Popular list includes: </strong></p><li> Most Emailed</li><li> Most Shared on Facebook </li><li> Most Searched on the web</li><li> Most Tweeted</li><p> You can also view which top articles have been trending over the &lsquo;Last 24 hours&rsquo;, &lsquo;Last 7 days&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;Last 30 days&rsquo;.</p><br /><p> So Vanessa asked me back in October of 2015 if I could archive NYT&rsquo;s &lsquo;Most Emailed&rsquo; on a spreadsheet and see which articles are trending every week. I would start every Monday by looking at all 20 articles and listing out:</p><li> The Headline of the article</li><li> Subheading</li><li> Promise (what the article promised)</li><li> Topic (what the article was about)</li><li> Whether the article went viral or not</li><li> And finally, the link to the article itself</li><p> Then on Friday, I would look at the articles and mark the ones that stayed in the Top 20 as viral and then add the new articles from that week. The longest an article would stay in the Top 20 would be a full week (from one Monday to the next Monday). Here are a few examples of great stories that were up:</p><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html\" target=\"_blank\">   The Lawyer Who Became DuPont&rsquo;s Worst Nightmare  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/opinion/sunday/addicted-to-distraction.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   Addicted to Distraction  </a> </u></li><li> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/sunday/your-iphone-is-ruining-your-posture-and-your-mood.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">   Your iPhone Is Ruining Your Posture &mdash; and Your Mood  </a> </u></li><br /><p> After archiving these articles for four months, I put these in a graph to see which &lsquo;Promise&rsquo; and &lsquo;Topic&rsquo; were at the top of the trending list. Below are the descriptions of what we were looking for in each section.</p><h3> Promise <br/>  </h3><p> The promise of each headline is what the article promises the reader. In other words, if the reader clicks on it, what will it give them? A new outcome? A learning? A surprise? An update? Here are the categories we used:</p><p> Question: this is anytime a headline referred to a question.</p><p> How to: this is when a headline suggested tips, self-help, or even a way of doing something new.</p><p> History: this applied when the headline included a time, period, or moment in history.</p><p> Snark: this is when a headline had a clever, funny, or punny title that didn&rsquo;t quite explain the article.</p><p> New: this is anytime the headline suggest any type of new research or if there was a new discovery.</p><p> Story: this is when a headline implied that you would read a great story about a person or particular place.</p><h3> Results: <br/>  </h3><p> As you can see, the articles with a promise of a Story overwhelmingly populated our results with 195 articles and Newcoming in second with 109.</p><br /><p> Next, is an image of all the articles that went viral (The &lsquo;Y&rsquo; in the Viral section from Fig. 3) over the four-month span.</p><br /><p> As you can see the story still managed to stay at the top with 72 of the articles going viral from Monday to Friday, or from Friday &ndash; Monday of the following week.</p><h3> Topic <br/>  </h3><p> Up next, let&rsquo;s look at topic and its meanings. The topic category is simply what the headline implies about the content of the article:</p><p> Location: this is anytime an article mentions a country, area, region, city, or landmark.</p><p> Your Health: this is anytime an article talks about losing weight, diseases, brain activity or a new health discovery.</p><p> Person: this is whenever an article mentions a person; politician, actor, death, or historical figure.</p><p> General Interest: this is anytime the headline suggests any type general interest like demographics, culture, or economics.</p><p> The results below show us that the leader of the pack was General Interest, with 252 articles and Person coming in second with 135.</p><br /><br /><p> Nothing changed in the viral section either; General Interest still managed to stay at the top with 104 of the articles going viral from Monday to Friday, or from Friday &ndash; Monday of the following week.</p><p> This tells us that regardless of the topic, a story can still resonate with those around the world. But how? What is that secret ingredient that makes people want to share stories with their friends and family through e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter?</p><h3> The Secret Sauce <br/>  </h3><p> Paul J. Zak, a scientist, author, and public speaker has done numerous studies on this topic and suggests that the key to a great story is to produce Oxytocin with your audience. Oxytocin is one of the most powerful hormones we produce because it plays a big role in feeling connected to another human being.</p><p> Stories produce oxytocin. This is why our brains love great narratives and films; they use amazing tools that grab you and me by the shirt and keep us emotionally engaged all the way through the sequence. This is why Nicholas Sparks is best known for writing romantic novels like &ldquo;The Notebook&rdquo;&ndash; he emotionally engages his audience with compelling stories about relationships. And that is why we, as guys, watch action flicks like &ldquo;300&rdquo;, and &ldquo;James Bond&rdquo;, and feel like we can do 100 pushups then save the world. Character-driven stories with some sort of emotional substance get us hooked and ready to take action.</p><h3> Take-Away: <br/>  </h3><p> Stories are your hook. Do you want your pitch to go viral? Do you want more people to like your status updates? Stories are key. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you are talking about as long as you can take your reader on a short journey. For example:</p><p> Boring Update: Yay! Seeing Grandma today! Look out, big grandma hug + homemade cookies</p><p> Story Update: Yay! It&rsquo;s been two years since I&rsquo;ve seen my Grandma&ndash;not sure what I am more excited for.. getting a grandma hug or eating grandma&rsquo;s cookies! #cantwait</p><p> You can add the story element&mdash;the emotion element to everything you do&ndash; to harness the power of connection.</p>",

    "content": "<p> When you run a business, it&rsquo;s hard not to learn everything you can about every topic related to running your company.</p><p> You have your hands in development, sales, and even marketing. So as each industry grows and changes, you hear the headlines but little else &mdash; and sometimes those headlines can be misleading. </p><p> In the world of content marketing, misunderstandings and misleading truths abound.</p><h3> Here are five content marketing myths that might be holding your small business back: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Myth: If you blog, your website will instantly attract tons of new visitors <br/>  </h3><p> We speak with small business owners who are nervous to embrace content marketing because they hear how well it works and think that starting a blog will lead to an outrageous amount of business that they simply can&rsquo;t handle yet.</p><p> As effective as content marketing is, it&rsquo;s important to understand that it&rsquo;s a form of marketing that takes time and attention to achieve results. Content marketing is something you should start now so that you can reap the rewards in 6-12 months &mdash; not something that threatens to bring your small business processes crashing down with too much business.</p><h3> 2. Myth: Your only goal is tons of traffic <br/>  </h3><p> We&rsquo;ve already addressed the idea that tons of traffic isn&rsquo;t the best result of a content or social media marketing campaign. Instead, what we look for with content marketing is a healthy amount of targeted traffic that takes action on your website. &ldquo;Going viral&rdquo; won&rsquo;t help your business if it doesn&rsquo;t result in customer action.</p><h3> 3. Myth: Skip video, customers and search engines want text content <br/>  </h3><p> Video is very much a part of content marketing and can be effective for many industries. Customers who watch product videos are 85 percent more likely to buy products compared to those who don&rsquo;t, and companies using online video for promotion have seen up to a 20 to 40 percent sales lift. Search engines also appreciate (and rank) video content when it is optimized for SEO, as you can see when you perform any search and see videos from YouTube ranking in your results.</p><h3> 4. Myth: Search optimization is a one-and-done deal <br/>  </h3><p> While many small business owners see SEO as a one-time thing, the truth is that your website&rsquo;s SEO is always evolving and competing for ranking. You can&rsquo;t check the SEO box off on your to-do list and call it done; you&rsquo;ve got to do frequent check-ins to assess your progress and make adjustments. As you go along, you&rsquo;ll add keywords, context, and different kinds of content to maximize your SEO.</p><h3> 5. Myth: Small businesses can&rsquo;t afford content marketing <br/>  </h3><p> This is the biggest myth of all: that only large businesses can afford to break into content marketing. In reality, the opposite is true. Content marketing is an open marketplace that any business of any size can capitalize on. All it takes is time, research, and energy and you can develop a content marketing strategy that uses your website, social media, email, content, and video to build relationships and drive traffic to your website.</p><p> Yes, it&rsquo;s more effective more quickly when you partner with a marketing team to deliver those results, but budget should never be a reason you aren&rsquo;t participating in content marketing.</p><p> Running a small business is tough enough without having to worry about your content marketing. You just need to inform yourself and work with the right partners to make sure you&rsquo;re achieving the best results possible. The first step in that process? Making sure you update your knowledge about content marketing and bust all of the myths above.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> There are three questions I get asked over and over again by friends and readers who care about advancing their careers.</p><li> How do I convince my boss to give me a promotion or raise?</li><li> How do I deal with a colleague who seems determined to F up my life?</li><li> How do I re-brand myself so people take me more seriously at work? <br/>  </li><p> Over the next few articles I&rsquo;ll go through each one of these to give you some tips that have served me well in my career so you can avoid some of the mistakes I made along the way. Let&rsquo;s start with #1!</p><h3> How do I convince my boss to give me a promotion or raise? <br/>  </h3><p> The phrasing of this question is actually a great place to start. More often than not the promotion question contains phrases that sound a lot like these:</p><li> How do I convince my boss to give me a promotion?</li><li> How do I ask my boss for a promotion?</li><li> How can I make my boss recognize that I deserve a promotion? <br/>  </li><p> If you&rsquo;re thinking about the promotion process along these lines i.e. as something you have to pitch, show or make your boss do, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re already heading down the wrong path. In fact, the biggest mistake I see friends and colleagues make when it comes to promotions, is that they treat them as a point in time event - a binary decision or pitch to their boss. This strategy will get you nowhere.</p><p> It doesn't help matters that so many career blogs and workplace columns focus so much time on the importance of bringing in data to support your case, preparing your pitch for a promotion etc. They&rsquo;re all missing the point.</p><p> The single most important thing you can do to get a promotion is to stop thinking about it as an event or a decision, and rather turn it into a journey you go on together with your boss.</p><p> I've never asked for a promotion in my life but I've had several. As counter-intuitive as it may sound, when it comes to promotions, you have to play the long game to make them happen fast.</p><h3> So how does that work? <br/>  </h3><p> When you frame your promotion as a journey, your boss can never say no: </p><p> If I walk into my boss&rsquo;s office tomorrow and ask him to promote me to President, I&rsquo;m putting him in a very difficult spot. I&rsquo;m unnecessarily forcing him into making a binary decision which will more than likely result in a &ldquo;no&rdquo;. There are just too many reasons for him to reject this style of pitch. The timing may not be right, there may be someone in the job already, the budget might not be there, and my skills might not be adequate. By forcing him to make a discrete yes or no choice, I&rsquo;m inadvertently hurting my chances for a promotion and I&rsquo;m also risking the relationship I have with my boss by putting him or her in such an uncomfortable position. Making your boss uncomfortable in the promotion discussion is exactly the opposite of what you want.</p><p> The secret to getting promotions is to get your boss on your team &ndash; rooting for your success. When I&rsquo;m working towards a promotion I want my boss to be my biggest cheerleader &ndash; I want my promotion to be a day he celebrates with me, not a day where I finally get him to capitulate.</p><p> Turning the promotion conversation into a journey means that you reframe the conversation away from a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; decision and towards a &ldquo;what will it take for me to get there and how can you help me&rdquo; conversation &ndash; which is almost never met with a &ldquo;no&rdquo;. A journey, unlike a binary decision, carries no defined date, which means you&rsquo;re only asking your boss to join you on a path towards a promotion which you&rsquo;ll define together. This is fundamentally different from &ldquo;asking&rdquo; for a promotion. It turns the promotion into a win-win scenario for both parties. You give your boss the opportunity to define all the criteria and skills he&rsquo;d like in his ideal candidate and you get absolute clarity and buy in on what it will take for you to get there. This approach might seem like it will take a bit longer but it&rsquo;s infinitely more effective than forcing an on-the-spot decision.</p><h3> Here are four ways to get your boss to join you on your promotion journey and become your biggest cheerleader: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Tell your boss what you want 12 months or more before you actually want it. </strong></p><p> This one may be frustrating for those of you who are dying for that promotion right now, but you need to be patient. The earlier you engage your boss in the promotion journey the sooner it will happen for you, but you just can&rsquo;t force it.</p><p> <strong>  2. Engage your boss like a friend and mentor &ndash; not like an adversary. </strong></p><p> People respond well to being approached as a mentor. Don&rsquo;t make the promotion discussion overly formal either, keep it friendly. You want your boss to WANT to help you get there. By not forcing her to make a decision on the spot and by soliciting her help as you work towards your goal, you&rsquo;ll accomplish that.</p><p> <strong>  3. Don&rsquo;t focus on dates &ndash; focus on skills, deliverables and development. </strong></p><p> You need to re-frame the promotion conversation to be about you achieving specific development milestones. Maybe you need training or you need to improve on a particularly metric or deliverable.  You need to work with your boss to set up a list of achievements that when met will mean you&rsquo;re ready. This puts you in the driver&rsquo;s seat and in control of how long it will take to get promoted.</p><p> <strong>  4. Maintain a regular dialogue to understand your progress towards the goal. </strong></p><p> This doesn't need to be formal &ndash; in fact I recommend it isn't. But one way or the other you need to be talking to your boss about your progress at least once every couple of months. Do not let it go for six months or a year and then bring it up again all of a sudden &ndash; that&rsquo;s just making the same mistake all over again. And when you do talk to your boss about it, keep it light, let her know how good you&rsquo;re doing on your journey but don&rsquo;t push it too hard.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> We would all like our work to be satisfying and meaningful. And to that end, there is an entire industry of books, life coaches, and assessments dedicated to helping people discover what they should really be doing. <br/>  </h3><p> The dramatic story you read about the fellow who quits his job as an accountant to start a non-profit, however, can be a red herring. Such examples blind us to the enormous opportunity you may have smack in front of you&mdash;right now, today&mdash;to reshape your job and increase both your impact and your personal satisfaction. </p><p> Indeed, the search for the perfect job that will finally fulfill us is something of an idol of our modern culture. It&rsquo;s part of that quest for the &ldquo;perfect whatever&rdquo; (perfect apartment, perfect spouse, perfect city to live in, etc.) that will finally make you happy&mdash;and which almost never does once you get it.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s a framework I developed that will help you be more effective and fulfilled at your current job. You may, possibly, ultimately need to make a more radical change. But try this first. It has transformed my own work and helped many executives I&rsquo;ve coached. My good friend and fellow consultant Scott Nadler was very helpful in fleshing this out with me:</p><p> <strong>  Ask yourself two basic questions: </strong></p><li> What do I do in my work&mdash;or am I capable of doing in it&mdash;that adds the most value to others and helps get the results for me and my organization? (Conversely, what do you do that has the least impact?)</li><li> What gets me up in the morning&mdash;that is, what do I do in my work that I am most passionate and enthusiastic about? (Conversely, what do I do that I&rsquo;m indifferent to or worse, that keeps me up at night with worry and concern?)</li><p> It may be helpful to carefully think about and list all of the main activities in your work. And also, to imagine things you could be doing, within your current job, that aren&rsquo;t part of your role today.</p><p> <strong>  Here&rsquo;s what this looks like in a 2&times;2 matrix: </strong></p><p> <a href=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Personal-Impact-Matrix.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"Personal Impact Matrix\" src=\"http://andrewsobel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Personal-Impact-Matrix-1024x891.jpg\"/> </a></p><p> For example: A few years ago I found that I was spending way too much time on the processes and analysis that wrapped around my consulting and training work. I mean things like doing a tons of interviews, analyzing data, putting memos and slides together, fussing too much over the exact sequencing of a workshop, and so on. I realized that my clients could do most of these things perfectly well themselves&mdash;even better than me&ndash;and that after 30 years as a professional consultant I was no longer interested in doing them myself. This fell clearly in the lower-left &ldquo;Eliminate&rdquo; quadrant of the matrix.</p><p> I also realized that where I truly added value&mdash;and enjoyed my work&mdash;was having face-to-face conversations with my senior clients about their business challenges and how to address them. My clients told me they wished they had more of this face time&mdash;more live discussions to help them reframe their problems, evaluate their options, and get immediate suggestions for improvement from me. I was acting too much like a young consultant and not enough like one with over three decades of rich business experience around the world. I slowly began to change this, and realized many benefits&mdash;for example, I found:</p><li> I was adding more value to my clients</li><li> I was more energized about my work</li><li> I was less overwhelmed, and spending fewer late nights getting written documents ready for a client meeting the next day.</li><li> My sessions with my clients were more vibrant and engaging because by sticking less to a pre-written script I created more interaction and unleashed more creativity.</li><p> Examples like this abound. Recently, for example, I coached a top sales executive who was spending two-thirds of his week in internal meetings and filling out reports instead of meeting with clients. He was frustrated and felt his talent was being wasted.</p><p> So take your own list of activities and position them on the Personal Impact Matrix.</p><p> Next, here&rsquo;s what you need to do for the activities in each of the quadrants:</p><h3> The ELIMINATE quadrant <br/>  </h3><p> This is the quadrant of Bill Lumbergh, the smarmy boss at the fictitious, high-tech company in the cult film &ldquo;Office Space.&rdquo; He constantly roams through the cubicles, chastising employees for being late with their so-called TPS expense reports. For activities in this quadrant&mdash;things that don&rsquo;t add a lot of value and that are tedious or uninteresting to you&mdash;can you:</p><li> Just stop doing them?</li><li> Delegate them to someone else?</li><li> Streamline them?</li><h3> The REFOCUS quadrant <br/>  </h3><p> To quote the famous fourth-century monk and theologian, Augustin, you need to &ldquo;re-order your loves&rdquo; when you find yourself in this quadrant. You&rsquo;re doing stuff you find enjoyable and interesting, but it&rsquo;s not allowing you to have much impact.</p><p> One of my clients ran a consulting firm whose growth had stalled and profitability was stagnant. He needed, as they say, to &ldquo;work on the business&rdquo; not &ldquo;in the business.&rdquo; He loved the nuts and bolts of reviewing market research reports and analyzing competitive data. But in truth, he had very bright staff who could do this extremely well themselves&mdash;at a much lower cost. As a result, instead of developing his thought leadership, marketing the company, and going out to speak with high-value prospects, he was pouring over excel spreadsheets.</p><p> If you find it hard to let go of these &ldquo;Refocus&rdquo; quadrant activities, sober yourself up by thinking about how many days you have left on Earth. It&rsquo;s a finite number&mdash;I guarantee you. Whether you believe that number is one thousand or ten thousand or twenty thousand days, ask yourself: Is continuing to spend time on these activities going to help me leave a legacy and really impact the people around me?</p><h3> The REFRAME quadrant <br/>  </h3><p> Activities in this quadrant pose a special challenge. You&rsquo;re doing important work here&mdash;things that are really adding value. But they are keeping you up at night. You&rsquo;re worried whether everything is going to go just right. You want it to be&hellip;well, perfect. Perhaps you seek approval and acclaim&mdash;you&rsquo;d like to hear, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so smart and accomplished! Bravo! We love you!&rdquo;</p><p> The Reframe quadrant is also the burnout quadrant. You work harder and harder to get it just right and be successful. But in the meantime the stomach acid is churning, you&rsquo;re tossing and turning at night, and spending less and less time with your family and friends. So you need to reframe. Here are two related shifts that you can make in your thinking:</p><p> <strong>  1. Strive for personal excellence rather than success as defined by other people&rsquo;s metrics. </strong></p><p> For example, when I give a keynote speech, I have to ask myself, what is the definition of success? Is it that the CEO liked my speech and recommends me to another part of his company? If so, I&rsquo;ll play to him or her and try and get them to like me.</p><p> Is it high ratings on the evaluation forms? Well, that&rsquo;s pretty superficial&mdash;the audience members might rate me very highly because I was entertaining, but then not change their behavior one bit! In that case I might tell more or funny stories and jokes. Is it long-term changes in behavior leading to improved business results over time? In that case I can hardly get excited about ratings sheets. Maybe the more people object to some of what I say, the more they will be engaged and reflective&mdash;and the more change that will occur. You see my point.</p><p> Excellence, in contrast, is the quality of your work&mdash;which you control. I like former college basketball coach John Wooden&rsquo;s definition of success (he was one of the most winning coaches in sports history):</p><p> &ldquo;Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.&rdquo;</p><p> <strong>  2. Focus on a successful outcome for your client, not perfection. </strong></p><p> There is such a thing as over-delivery. Remember, you&rsquo;re trying to help your clients achieve their goals, not be perfect. Why write a 100-page report with color graphs if a ten-page one in black and white will get the same result (maybe better!)? Do you really need to interview 25 people for your project? Maybe 10 would suffice.</p><h3> The DOUBLE DOWN quadrant <br/>  </h3><p> In this quadrant, in the upper right, you&rsquo;re doing work you are passionate about&mdash;it gets you out of bed in the morning&mdash;and you&rsquo;re creating real value. It doesn&rsquo;t get much better than this. It is in this quadrant where you eventually want most of your work to take place.</p><p> My prescription here is to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; more often. Warren Buffet said,</p><p> &ldquo;The difference between successful people and really successful people is that the really successful ones say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to just about everything.&rdquo;</p><p> As a successful person, you will constantly be tempted to dilute your focus. If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll come up with interesting ideas and you&rsquo;ll want to pursue them all. Others will ask you to do things for them or with them. Your boss will pile more and more on your plate&mdash;much of which is not central to your Double Down quadrant.</p><p> So stay focused on your sweet spot, and do more and more of the things you love to do at work and which allow you to add great value.</p><p> In summary&mdash;the single idea in the title is this: Reflect on where you uniquely add value and identify what really gets you out of bed in the morning. Then focus like a laser on it.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t have to ditch your job to find more fulfillment and have greater impact. Spend some time on this exercise and you may be able to make a dramatic shift in 2016.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> During a private coaching session, one of my clients expressed frustration because she hadn&rsquo;t been able to get started on the priorities we had laid out for her practice. <br/>  </h3><p> She is a successful advisor and as we began our work together I could tell she was truly motivated to take her business to the next level. But something, as yet to be determined, was getting in her way.</p><p> As we discussed this problem, I asked her to pull out a document she had printed following one of our prior calls. After several minutes, she simply couldn&rsquo;t find the paper she knew &ldquo;was here somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;maybe this advisor needs to consider some basic office organization.&rdquo;</p><p> Since most of my coaching work is conducted by phone, I had never seen this advisor&rsquo;s office. Based on her professional demeanor and past success, I would have never guessed that this advisor would have a highly disorganized office.</p><p> So I asked her, &ldquo;Can you see the top of your desk?&rdquo;</p><p> And she replied, &ldquo;Robb, I&rsquo;m not even sure what my desk is made of.&rdquo;</p><p> Then, for the next several minutes, my client described all the pent up frustration she was feeling because she had let this &ldquo;obvious problem&rdquo; go unattended for so long:</p><li> She felt unprofessional &mdash; it had been years since she had held a client meeting in her office (instead she used a conference room) and when an occasional client saw her office she felt embarrassed. Many of her colleagues avoided her office.</li><li> She was easily distracted &mdash; because she constantly had to go through piles of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; to find material for her current projects, she often found herself taking inordinate lengths of time to get things done. For example, while looking for a report for an appointment, she might come across something else that was less urgent and spend time tinkering with it.</li><li> Her assistant felt helpless &ndash;the chaos in this advisor&rsquo;s office kept her assistant from doing a major part of her job. The advisor often found herself saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; because it was easier for her to sort through her mess than it was to tell her assistant where she might find a file or report. <br/>  </li><h3> The bottom line &mdash; disorganization was getting in the way of progress. <br/>  </h3><p> Now, I know you may be thinking, &ldquo;My office is messy, but not this bad.&rdquo; And I hope you&rsquo;re right. But my experience tells me that at times most advisors suffer from some of these same feelings of frustration.</p><p> Do you ever?</p><li> Spend a Saturday doing a major office makeover. Perhaps once or twice a year you&rsquo;re forced into a major clean up session to make up for the sloppiness of the prior months.</li><li> Lie to yourself about your filing system. Maybe you tell yourself that the stacks of paper on your office floor are really a filing system. In truth, you&rsquo;re not really sure how the stacks got started.</li><li> Tell others you like having your important papers within easy reach. When in truth, you haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea why some of the stuff that&rsquo;s on your desk got there in the first place.</li><li> Empty your inbox into a drawer. Of course, you do this, to make yourself feel like you&rsquo;ve gotten something accomplished. <br/>  </li><p> If you never find yourself questioning your organizational skills with questions like these, you may not need this article. Stop reading and pass it along to someone who will benefit. You know who they are! (They could be on your team.)</p><h3> For the rest of us, here are a handful of &ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo; tips to keep your office mess from becoming a distraction: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1.  Start with a giant trash can (or recycle bin) &mdash; As you get started; you&rsquo;ll feel better if you can quickly get rid of a lot of your visible clutter. Don&rsquo;t hide it in a drawer or a closet, throw it away. Here&rsquo;s the type of stuff you can probably get rid of most quickly: </strong></p><li> Prospectuses and sales materials you receive in the mail or left behind by a wholesaler. You may have saved these colorful brochures for &ldquo;future reference&rdquo;, but now that they&rsquo;ve inhabited your office for months without your attention they are a primary target for disposal. After all, if you need another copy, your strategic partners will gladly send you one.</li><li> Newspapers and magazines. Will you really need that Wall Street Journal from 1999? Is last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;office organization&rdquo; issue of your favorite advisor magazine really going to be read?</li><li> The e-documents you printed. Okay, I know it&rsquo;s sometimes easier to read a printed copy of an email or a research report, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to keep it as a permanent decoration for your office. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  2.  Get your assistant involved &mdash; Now that there&rsquo;s actually room for 2 people in your office, ask your assistant for some help. After all, helping you keep your office organized is probably part of the reason you hired him or her in the first place. And when left to do what they do well, most assistants will shine. </strong></p><p> Think about it:</p><li> Who knows more about your daily work habits (good and bad)? Who knows more about the likes and dislikes of your clients? Who makes the best jokes about the mess in your office?</li><li> Who hears most of the complaints about your disorganization?</li><li> All kidding aside, to make this process work AND LAST, you need to develop an organizational system that is understood by more than just yourself. If you allow your assistant to take charge or at the very least offer major input, you stand a better chance of being successful. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  3.  Don&rsquo;t create an overly complicated file system &mdash; If you take this &ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo; process too far, you can cause more harm than good. Don&rsquo;t try to turn simple organization into the world&rsquo;s greatest filing system. Dewey already invented the decimal system and your office is not the local library. </strong></p><p> Here are the main (and possibly the only) files you need to keep:</p><li> Client files &mdash; Your largest file cabinet should be dedicated exclusively to your client files. After all, your clients are the lifeblood of your business. You stand a better chance of keeping these files in tact when you put your assistant, not yourself, in charge, so keep these records near his or her desk.</li><li> Compliance and financial records &mdash; Another obviously important grouping of files are those you use to satisfy your regulatory and financial requirements. Keep these records separate from your other files.</li><li> Research and sales material &mdash; This is NOT the file for the stuff you should have deposited in the recycle bin. But you probably have research reports and marketing materials that you use on a recurring basis. Keep them together in one location so you can easily put your hands on them as needed.</li><li> Current projects &mdash; The only files I would keep in your desk drawers would be those that relate to your pending projects or upcoming appointments. Otherwise, they should be filed in (or go back to) the categories referenced above.</li><li> Weekly reading &mdash; Get a basket for the reading material that crosses your desk (or dedicated email box) on a daily basis. If you don&rsquo;t need or read it right away, deposit it in the basket for the quiet times you dedicate to research and reading. At the end of each week, clear this basket out by depositing unread material in your circular file. If it wasn&rsquo;t important this week, it probably won&rsquo;t be important next week or the week after next or&hellip;</li><li> Goals and priorities file &mdash; Finally, keep a single file folder with your business plan in your top desk drawer. You need to be able to quickly reference your goals and priorities. This will help you stay organized by staying on task. <br/>  </li><p> <strong>  4.  Adopt the clean desk rules &mdash; Now that your office is free from clutter and your files are organized, live by the clean desk rules.  Repeat after me, I will&hellip; </strong></p><li> Avoid distractions by only keeping my most current project on the top of my desk.</li><li> Replace each file after use or put it in a &ldquo;to be filed&rdquo; box for my assistant.</li><li> Always remember that my assistant is crucial to my success and office efficiency, so I will consult with her (him) before I change my organizational system.</li><li> Never be afraid to throw &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; away, keeping it around doesn&rsquo;t make it more important.</li><li> Dust the top of my office furniture weekly to keep my workspace free from clutter and avoid the return of bad habits. <br/>  </li><p> The client I referenced at the beginning of this article has reported great strides in most of these areas. She is feeling more relaxed and is ready to tackle new challenges for growing her business. Plus, her assistant now feels even more like she&rsquo;s part of a team.</p><p> She recently told me, &ldquo;I love walking into my office now and seeing how nice everything looks. It looks a lot more professional.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t it funny how we can sometimes turn the simplest of problems into mental blocks that affect the direction of our businesses?</p><p> Is it time for you to break out the trash can and the dust rags?</p>",

    "link": "are-you-measuring-your-marketing-effectiveness-correctly",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> When speaking about the power of converging different technical disciplines to yield customer insights, it&rsquo;s common for the conversation to focus on converging analytics and research for proposition insights. But what about measuring your marketing effectiveness? <br/>  </h3><p> Another rich territory for seeing the benefit of multiple technical customer insight (CI) disciplines is the measurement of marketing effectiveness.</p><p> In this short overview, we&rsquo;ll review the ways both analytics and research provide inputs needed for a more holistic view of your overall marketing effectiveness. </p><p> One of the reasons for needing to call on the skills of two complementary CI disciplines, is the need to measure different types of marketing spend. The most obvious example is probably the challenge of measuring the effectiveness of &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; verses &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; marketing.</p><p> For those not so familiar with this language, born out of accounting terminology, the difference can perhaps be best understood by considering the &lsquo;purchase funnel&lsquo;.</p><p> Most, if not all, marketers will be familiar with the concept of a purchase funnel. It represents the steps that need to be achieved in a consumer journey towards making a purchase. Although often now made more complex, to represent the nuanced stages of online engagement/research or the post-sale stages towards retention/loyalty, at its simplest a purchase funnel represents four challenges. These are to reach a mass of potential consumers and take some on the journey through awareness, consideration and preference to purchase. The analogy of the funnel represents that fewer people will progress to each subsequent stage.</p><p> <img alt=\"Purchase Funnel.001\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/customerinsightleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Purchase-Funnel.001.jpg?resize=300%2C298\"/></p><p> Back to our twin types of marketing. Above-the-line marketing (ATL) is normally the use of broadcast or mass-media communication to achieve brand awareness &amp; consideration for meeting certain needs. Getting on the &lsquo;consideration list&lsquo; if you will. Traditionally this was often TV, radio, cinema, outdoor &amp; newspaper advertising. Below-the-line marketing (BTL) is normally the use of targeted direct marketing communications to achieve brand/product preferenceand sales promotions. Traditionally this was often direct mail, outbound calling and email marketing. In recent years many markers talk in terms of &ldquo;through-the-line&rdquo; (TTL) advertising, which is an integrated combination of ATL &amp; BTL messages for a campaign. Social Media marketing is often best categorised as TTL, but elements can be either ATL or BTL, largely distinguished by whether or not you can measure who saw the marketing and have feedback data on their response.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s return to the theme of using multiple CI disciplines to measure the effectiveness of these different types of marketing. The simpler example is BTL marketing. Here the data that can be captured on both who was targeted and their behaviour following enables the application of what is called the experimental or scientific method. In essence the skills of Database Marketing teams, to set-up campaigns with control cells and feedback loops. To merge the resulting data and evidence incremental changes in behaviour as a result of the stimuli of marketing campaigns and optimise future targeting.</p><p> ATL marketing is more of a challenge. Because control cells do not exist and it is impossible to be certain who saw the marketing the comparison needs to be based on time series data. Here the expertise of Analytics teams comes to the fore, especially Econometric modelling. This can be best understood as a set of statistical techniques for identifying which of many possible factors can best explain changes in sales over time and then the ability to combine these into a predictive model that can predict future sales patterns based on those inputs. There are many skills needed here and the topic is worthy of a separate post, but for now suffice to say that analytical questioning techniques to elicit potential internal &amp; external factors are as important as modelling skills.</p><p> Hopefully you can see that my definition of today&rsquo;s TTL marketing campaigns thus necessitates making use of both Database Marketing and Analytics team skills to measure marketing effectiveness. But beyond this simply being a division of labour between ATL elements being measured by analytics teams and BTL by database marketing ones, there is another way they need to work together.</p><p> Reaching the most accurate or helpful marketing attribution is an art as much as a science. In reality, even BTL marketing effectiveness measurement is imprecise (due to the complexities of media interdependencies and not knowing if the consumer really paid attention to communications received). In a world where your potential consumers are exposed to TTL marketing with omni-channel options of response, no one source of evidence or skill set provides a definitive answer. For that reason, I once again recommend convergence of Customer Insight evidence.</p><p> <img alt=\"Marketing Attribution convergence.001\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/customerinsightleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Marketing-Attribution-convergence.001.jpg?resize=150%2C150\"/></p><p> Best practice is to garner the evidence from: (a) incremental behaviour models (econometric or experimental method); (b) sales reporting (reconciling with Finance numbers); (c) market position (research trackers); (d) media effectiveness tracking (reconciling with behaviour achieved throughout purchase funnel).</p><p> Converging all this evidence, provided by data, analytics, research &amp; database marketingprovides the best opportunity to determine robust marketing attribution. But do keep a record of your assumptions and hypotheses to be tested in next campaigns.</p><p> I hope that was helpful. How are you doing at measuring the effectiveness of your marketing? I hope you&rsquo;re focussed on incremental profit not &lsquo;followers&rsquo;.</p>",

If you look at the dictionary definition of &lsquo;purpose&rsquo;, it is quite simple:</p><p> &ldquo;the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists.&rdquo;</p><p> Every single person in an organisation SHOULD have a very clear sense of understanding the reasons why the organisation does what it does AND why the organisation exists. The problem is that I do not think there are many organisations where this simple understanding actually exists.</p><p> <strong>  To test the theory, go and seek ten employees at random in your place of work. Ask them these two questions: </strong></p><p> 1. What does our organisation do?</p><p> 2. Why does our organisation exist?</p><p> It will be fascinating to see what responses you get. If the responses are very similar, then it is possible that there is clarity of purpose in your business. If the answers are varied and different &ndash; perhaps not.</p><p> Developing a very clear and well understood organisational purpose is critical if the business is likely to succeed in its attempts to sustainably achieve its strategic goals. If employees have differing senses of the &lsquo;reason for being&rsquo; of an organisation, then this will and can only translate into the delivery of random customer experiences. If you want your customers to have a consistent customer experience, all employees need to know what that consistent customer experience should be. </p><p> I have been working with a global financial services business. They have clarified their purpose as &lsquo;enabling positive futures&rsquo; &ndash; in other words, the better able they are to deliver financial services, the more likely they are to enable the positive futures of their customers. They key is that every employee in their business needs to be conscious of this in everything they do.</p><p> This is why I like to think of an organisations purpose as the &lsquo;North Star&rsquo; &ndash; the simple statement that everyone should follow &ndash; in the same direction. There is no right way or wrong way to do this &ndash; what is important is that everyone is going in the same direction.</p><p> Helping to develop a &lsquo;North Star&rsquo; is a vital skill for any Customer Experience Professional &ndash; ultimately, the greater the clarity of purpose, the easier it will then be to determine how capable the customer journey is of bringing the purpose to life (or not, as the case may be!).</p><h3> If you are looking for a very simple way to develop this for yourself, consider following these very simple steps: <br/>  </h3><p> <strong>  1. Clarify the WHAT </strong>  &ndash; what exactly is it that your organisation does &ndash; it&rsquo;s products and services</p><p> <strong>  2. Clarify the WHY &ndash; </strong> why do you deliver these products and services &ndash; what is the purpose of them &ndash; your North Star</p><p> <strong>  3. Clarify the HOW &ndash; </strong> how are you going to ensure that you can enable the WHY &ndash; these constitute &lsquo;promises&rsquo; or &lsquo;commitments&rsquo; that you will make to your customers</p><p> <strong>  4. Clarify the &lsquo;DESIRED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE&rsquo; &ndash; </strong> if you can do the WHAT, WHY and HOW perfectly, what would be your simple description of the way you want your customers to FEEL?</p><p> Do not overcomplicate this exercise &ndash; one PowerPoint slide is sufficient to describe all of the above. It does not need to look fancy &ndash; it just needs to make simple sense &ndash; for everyone.</p><p> So if having read this column you are concerned that there may be a lack of clarity of purpose in your organisation, carry out these steps. Getting everyone to follow a North Star will not just enable you to deliver better, more consistent experiences for your customers, it will also vastly improve the employee experience as well.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Sometimes the more we learn, the more we realize we don&rsquo;t know. Especially when our exploration comes to terrain as dynamic and multifaceted as the human brain!</h3>With the recent hubbub surrounding Lumosity being found guilty of misleading consumers regarding the validity of their training programs, many have begun to question whether or not &ldquo;brain training&rdquo; really makes a difference.Unfortunately, sometimes the one making the most noise isn&rsquo;t the one having the greatest impact. I am proud to say that I have been involved with a scientifically validated brain training organization for over 5 years in my partnership with <a href=\"https://www.dreviangordonsbrain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Dr. Evian Gordon</a> and <a href=\"https://training.mybrainsolutions.com/entrepreneur/ebrainfitness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> My Brain Solutions.</a> As our collaboration has developed, Dr. Gordon and his team have been the foundation on which our Synergy Brain Health and Fitness programs are based. Real science with real results.<h3> How can I be so sure?</h3>Dr. Gordon and his consortium established <u> <a href=\"http://www.brainnet.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Brainnet.net </a></u>, upon which over 300 peer reviewed journal articles have been published. Soon, we will be able to include a study we worked on together, looking at the impact of perceived stress on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of the brain.It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that sometimes more information = more problems. So how do you cut through the noise? Here are a few simple guidelines to know when to Dig it (yes please!), Doubt it (not sure yet), or Ditch it (no way).<strong> Dig it:</strong> Similar to physical training, if mental or emotional training is going to work it must be specific, challenging, and repeated over time. Make sure that the actual tasks you&rsquo;re completing represent thoughts or behaviors that you want to change in your brain. If you&rsquo;re re-scripting your thought process (<u> <a href=\"https://www.mybrainsolutions.com/Pages/GameOverview.aspx?id=ThoughtTamer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  thoughttamer </a></u>), focusing on the positive (<u> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/e-catch-the-feeling/id340021527?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  e-catch the feeling app </a></u>), or practicing relaxation (mycalmbeat app) you can easily see how they translate to real-world application. Building your memory muscle by remembering names and faces (<u> <a href=\"https://www.mybrainsolutions.com/Pages/TrainingThatsFun/Courses/Memory.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  memory games </a></u>) or improving emotional intelligence through facial expression recognition (<u> <a href=\"https://www.mybrainsolutions.com/Pages/GameOverview.aspx?id=EmotionMatch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  emotion match </a></u>) strengthens cognitive and emotional capacities that have been shown to improve performance at work and at home.<strong> Doubt it:</strong> There seem to be mixed results on games and puzzles such as Sudoku, crosswords, or word searches. If you have to go back in your memory to recall information, this may make your recall functioning more efficient. If you have to work hard to complete the puzzle or task, you are likely firing neurons that will strengthen them over time, even if just slightly. And, if your games are relaxing, we know there is a brain boost in decreasing stress hormones. So these all help the brain, but do they really train the brain in a way that matters? We&rsquo;re not sure.But we are certain that if you utilize these types of games and activities to reduce stress while increasing focus on what&rsquo;s positive, they impact is significantly enhanced. Games like wordsmith highlight positive emotion words that non-consciously boost our brainpower over time.<strong> Ditch it: </strong>I always say if something turns out to be a miracle, we will all hear about it immediately. If a non-surgical procedure tries to convince you in an overnight fix, use your brain and ignore it quickly.Over the next few months, I&rsquo;ll be providing you more tips and techniques for science-based solutions you can easily implement in your daily routine. Next up, a busybody&rsquo;s guide to meditation. What works, and how to work it.",

    "content": "<h3> Is your business similar to the talent questions in the NFL? <br/>  </h3><p> The biggest question surrounding the NFL draft each year is whether the highly talented players will become high performing employees on their teams throughout their careers. There is some probability in predicting their success, but at the end of the day is it just a guess? How about in your business?</p><p> The key to the future of most firms is the people they hire. Some businesses I see take the most available employee who will work on the lower end of the pay scale. Is that really who you are looking for?</p><h3> What is your main criterion for evaluating your future employees? <br/>  </h3><p> Many of the tests put in place to evaluate NFL players have not panned out.</p><p> For instance, all NFL draft prospects are given the Wonderlic Test which is an IQ-type test used to measure the players&rsquo; aptitude for learning and problem solving. The possible score range is 1 to 50 (with 50 being perfect). But does it really predict whether they will be a great football player? When looking at just quarterbacks, Russell Wilson scored a 24, Terry Bradshaw a 16 (he won 4 Super Bowls), while Tony Romo scored a 37.</p><p> In the financial services industry, a firm is ultimately measured by clients served and acquisition of new clients. So, if the goal is to attract and serve clients (with assets under management), relationship skills more than anything else are required.</p><p> If you are interested in hiring socially intelligent staff, here are two social intelligence assessments that may be helpful in evaluating great potential employees:  <u>  <a href=\"http://kgajos.eecs.harvard.edu/mite/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Harvard-Developed Social Intelligence Test  </a> </u>  (simple, free, and takes 15 minutes) and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.psychometrics.com/en-us/assessments/firob.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   FIRO-B  </a> </u>  (designed to be an assessment for future coaching of employees).</p><p> Another option comes from a superstar in evaluating talent for teams &ndash; Fran Skinner with  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.aumpartnersllc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   www.aumpartnersllc.com  </a> </u> . The tool that her firm uses has incredible results in assessing leadership, culture, engagement, communication, job fit (incumbents and job candidates) and succession planning. I&rsquo;ve seen its power first hand.</p><p> Every day is draft day in business because in order to get ahead we have to have good employees. To win &ndash; however we define that in business &ndash; we need to have great, high performing employees. You and your clients deserve the best. It may be time to change the hiring process.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Reading through all the lessons that many leadership gurus share on social media and in their books, a leader can become overwhelmed. <br/>  </h3><p> One can even begin to question whether they are a leader at all, given what they see others doing. Some of us work really hard in our jobs, consumed with our daily goals and objectives, unable to take stock in what we have accomplished. We think that other leaders are far more knowledgeable and experienced, not giving ourselves the credit we deserve. Have these thoughts or feelings ever entered your mind? </p><p> STOP! Stop sabotaging yourself and instead look at ways to own your leadership.</p><h3> These 7 practices may help you see your leadership value: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Believe you are a leader <br/>  </h3><p> The adage goes- &ldquo;If you believe it, it will happen&rdquo; and this is so true of leadership. We need to see ourselves as leaders and envision what type of leader we want to be. If we just look around at other people&rsquo;s achievements and never believe we have the ability, skills and traits of a leader, we will never be able to grow our own leadership. Believe you can.</p><h3> 2. Lead from anyplace you are <br/>  </h3><p> One of the first words I share with the participants in my workshops is what leadership means. It is not about having a title or position, but rather a way of acting. These are some questions to ask about whether you are a leader:</p><li> Do I have a strong understanding of my role?</li><li> Do I take responsibility for mistakes I make?</li><li> Do I contribute my ideas and suggestions?</li><li> Am I communicating clearing, directly and respectfully?</li><li> Do I ask for help when I need it? <br/>  </li><h3> 3. Acknowledge that Imperfection is a myth <br/>  </h3><p> I recently worked with a manager who felt she couldn&rsquo;t perform certain parts of her job unless they were done to her liking. That meant she was paralyzed if she couldn&rsquo;t be perfect. The result was missed deadlines or constantly moving up the deadlines. In the ambiguous workplaces we lead, we do not always have complete information and we may need to act without all the pieces. We need to do our best with what we have, even if that means reworking our results at a later date. Dump perfection!</p><h3> 4. Share your experience <br/>  </h3><p> Be a great storyteller by rolling out the lessons you have learned along the way in narrative form. Through stories people connect emotionally and will remember what you shared. Our storytelling empowers us to be stronger and empathetic leaders as we communicate our struggles and missteps while still allowing our gifts to shine.</p><h3> 5. Boost others up <br/>  </h3><p> Whenever possible, show appreciation and praise to others who help you accomplish your goals. Leaders know that when we value the expertise and work of others, they will want to contribute even more. Remember how you feel when people say &ldquo;Thanks for your outstanding contribution to this project!&rdquo;</p><h3> 6. Find a fan club <br/>  </h3><p> We own our leadership when we surround ourselves with mentors who have our best interests at heart. Our fan club includes individuals who will provide us with honest feedback as well as direction and networking opportunities. Who could be in your fan club?</p><li> A past or current boss</li><li> A colleague</li><li> A friend</li><li> An expert in our field who we have gotten to know</li><li> A coach <br/>  </li><h3> 7. Stay open to riding the waves <br/>  </h3><p> The thing about leadership is that it continues to evolve as we change positions, move to new areas of the country or world or become fascinated with new concepts. Committing to a &ldquo;growth mindset&rdquo; and realizing that change is the only constant will empower us to own our leadership wherever it may take us.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Financial services marketers face challenges every day, from writing investor education articles to managing complex rebranding initiatives. There&rsquo;s one marketing challenge that we all wish would never happen, even though it&rsquo;s inevitable: communicating with investors about an underperforming investment solution.</p><p> So, tip number one: don&rsquo;t hide from underperformance. Quite the opposite. Get in front of it, be transparent and talk about what matters most to investors. Trust and understanding will go a long way to building a strong, enduring relationship.</p><h3> Identify investor concerns <br/>  </h3><p> Any project that tackles underperformance must start by identifying investor concerns. And when it comes to performance, investors typically have two highly important concerns:</p><li> Am I overpaying for my investments?</li><li> Will I achieve my financial goals?</li><p> Once you know investor concerns, use them to identify your key messages. Fees and the value of advice are hot-button topics in the financial services industry but for the purposes of this article, let&rsquo;s move forward with the idea of reassuring your investors that they will meet their goals.</p><h3> A note on the causes of underperformance <br/>  </h3><p> The reasons why a fixed income solution may underperform are different from those for an equity solution, and within equities, a Canadian solution may underperform for different reasons than a global solution. For example:</p><li> A bond fund could underperform because of unexpected interest rate moves</li><li> A Canadian fund may underperform because of its weighting to energy companies</li><li> A global fund could underperform as a result of its geographic allocation</li><p> The point here is that no one-size-fits-all strategy exists for communicating about short-term underperformance. To do it right, you need robust product and industry knowledge, and the ability to make complex issues investor friendly.</p><h3> Execution <br/>  </h3><p> You&rsquo;ve identified the primary investor concern: they&rsquo;re uncertain whether they will achieve their financial goals. Could there be a more valid concern? We don&rsquo;t think so. So, now it&rsquo;s time to execute.</p><p> <strong>  1. Create a special brochure </strong></p><p> By crafting a special print- and web-friendly brochure, you create an opportunity to talk about the benefits of the underperforming solution. For example, you can highlight:</p><li> The manager&rsquo;s philosophy and process &ndash; this is especially important if your firm has a strong history or if the manager has a truly unique approach</li><li> The solution&rsquo;s role in a diversified portfolio &ndash; investors may question why a certain solution made it into their portfolio, offering you the opportunity to talk about asset allocation</li><li> The importance of focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term volatility &ndash; remind investors that they are on the right path</li><p> <strong>  2. Build a microsite </strong></p><p> If you want to reinforce the importance of diversification and asset allocation, you can create an interactive microsite that uses the underperforming solution to diversify investor portfolios. Microsites are a great choice since they can have a long life. Why? Because, in this example, the asset allocation story is important at all times.</p><p> For microsite tips, read  <u>  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/marketing-articles/why-microsites-are-a-big-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Why microsites are a big deal  </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>  3. Produce a whitepaper </strong></p><p> We think that an investor-friendly whitepaper is equally valuable as a brochure in this situation because they naturally have a more sophisticated feel that relies on data. Talking about underperforming investment solutions isn&rsquo;t about whitewashing poor returns, it&rsquo;s about explaining the situation effectively and data can help you do this with clear examples.</p><p> For more on whitepapers, read  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/marketing-articles/whitepaper-tactics-that-work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Whitepaper tactics that work  </a> and  <a href=\"http://ext-marketing.com/marketing-articles/five-best-practices-for-creating-better-whitepapers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Five best practices for creating better whitepapers </a> .</p><p> <strong>  4. Write an advertorial </strong></p><p> Support your investors by supporting advisors. We recommend writing a piece specifically for a trade publication that not only references, but also builds, on the whitepaper mentioned above. Advertorials are a great way to reach a broad audience, and you can tie them into other marketing and ad campaigns.</p><p> <strong>  5. Host a PM roadshow </strong></p><p> Although portfolio manager roadshows might be falling out of favour as a result of their high costs, and while they aren&rsquo;t our first recommendation, they&rsquo;re still effective and beneficial if the portfolio manager believes a roadshow could help with retention efforts.</p><p> Since mutual fund underperformance is unavoidable, we think you should turn the challenge into an opportunity for you and your firm. Your honesty and transparency will help you build stronger relationships with investors. And don&rsquo;t forget to equip advisors with relevant materials first, since they are the ones who communicate directly with clients and field many of the performance questions from them.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Debt is an ugly four-letter word. </strong> It comes in all shapes and sizes, and generally includes mortgages, auto and student loans, credits cards, and more. In fact, as of December 2015, an average American household was estimated to have  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/average-credit-card-debt-household/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  $130,922 in debt </a> , with $15,762 of that number belonging to credit cards. Even more staggering is the $733 billion of credit card debt owned by U.S. consumers coming into this year. </p><p> As credit card debt is considered to be costly (and one of the worst kinds of debt), it&rsquo;s often reviewed first when putting together a financial plan. One overlooked question, however, is what comes next. What if you stuck to your plan and got those pesky credit card balances down to zero? What steps can you take to ensure you don&rsquo;t rack up those bills again?  </p><p> Below are my top three recommendations for keeping those credit card balances in check now that you&rsquo;ve greatly reduced or eliminated your debt.  </p><h3> Cut Up Those Credit Cards.</h3><p> <br/> As clich&eacute; as that image has become, this is an essential first step. There are a lot of psychological factors that go into acquiring debt, and if you were prone to racking up debt in the past, chances are you are prone to doing it again. Don't take the risk. Cut up your credit cards and rely on a bank debit card. This will ensure you only spend the money you actually have&mdash;not the funds your credit card company generously lets you &lsquo;borrow.&rsquo;  </p><h3> Check Yourself and Remain Accountable. </h3><p> <br/> Accountability is key when it comes to keeping credit card balances in check. At a minimum, schedule an annual financial check-up to build in that accountability. This can be done in a variety of ways&mdash;be it with a family member, a spouse, financial planner, or even YOURSELF. Knowing that this event is on the calendar will hopefully provide you with the needed motivation to stay on track. </p><h3> Utilize Tech Tools.</h3><p> <br/> With the advent of technology, mobility and online resources, it&rsquo;s now possible to find solutions to virtually anything using tech tools. Why not leverage technology to get a comprehensive view of your financial well-being? You can this with the help of a financial professional or even complimentary sites, such as  <a href=\"http://mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  mint.com </a> . Use these tools to track your spending or set budgets, and make it a habit to login in once per week to ensure consistency and results. </p><p> While there are plenty of reasons people fall into debt, more often than not, debt begins to spiral out of control because people neglect their finances. They are afraid to look, and by the time they get the courage&mdash;it's too late. Be proactive, take control and use the necessary tools to stay on track of your debt. The less you owe, the more you own, and the better chances of a successful financial life. </p>",

    "content": "<h3> Maybe the real question is &ldquo;Do they need to be?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Rather than feeling threatened by robo-advisors, many advisors feel the two worlds can peacefully co-exist. In fact, some advisors are using this &ldquo;disrupter&rdquo; as an opportunity to refine their business model. </p><p> How do clients feel about this subject? The &ldquo;Generations Apart&rdquo; study released in February 2016 by Allianz shows that 69% of both Baby Boomers and Gen Xers say they do not trust online financial advice.</p><p> And yet 46 percent of Gen Xers and 24 percent of Baby Boomers say they have some interest in exploring robo-advisors. Only 10 percent of both groups say they would be comfortable having their relationship with their financial advisor exist entirely online.</p><p> But before considering whether to do financial planning online, your clients (or prospects) need to ask themselves three important questions. Do they have the three &ldquo;T&rsquo;s&rdquo;?</p><li> Time</li><li> Talent</li><li> Temperament <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Time </strong></h3><p> <br/> Researching the different online platforms takes a lot of time. Creating a financial plan takes a lot of time. Do your clients want to add these items to their already full-plate of jobs, home projects and family time?</p><h3> <strong>  Talent </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your client may be extremely comfortable with technology and that works well for simple routine banking transactions such as deposits, balance inquiries and bill pay. But for more complex situations, they may prefer the human touch of an advisor because they can draw from their professional insight gained after years of industry experience.</p><p> John Hancock&rsquo;s 2015 Financial Stress Survey reveals that of the 2,000 people surveyed, 70% of those who work with a financial advisor are on track or ahead in saving for retirement, versus 33% of those not working with an advisor.</p><h3> <strong>  Temperament </strong></h3><p> <br/> We all have biases and when it comes to our finances, our emotions can get the best of us. Certain clients have a personality that looks at extreme volatility of the market as opportunities to buy. But could they be overconfident and make some big mistakes? Other clients are frightened of the market, especially if they are near or in retirement. What online advice could they use to prevent them from de-railing their plan in a moment of emotional stress? The personal touch of a financial advisor helps with the behavioral management of the client.</p><p> People like options. Over the years there has certainly been no shortage of financial professionals. Perhaps robo-advising is just an expansion of our choices in the financial services industry: online, online with some personal advice and complete customized personal advice. So fear not the robo-advisor. You want clients that choose you for the three T&rsquo;s.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Women-owned businesses are on the rise. Between 2002 and 2012, the number of women-owned firms increased at a rate of 52%, two-and-a-half times the national average of 20%, according to a report from the National Women&rsquo;s Business Council.</p><p> That statistic sounds sunny, but starting a business isn&rsquo;t as simple as putting an &ldquo;open&rdquo; sign on a door, and the challenges are multiplied for female entrepreneurs. Here are a few key hurdles:</p><h3> Lack of capital</h3><p> <br/> Women start their businesses with about  <u>  half as much capital as men do </u> , according to the NWBC &mdash; an average of $75,000, compared to an average of $135,000. Male business owners frequently have trouble raising necessary capital, too, but industry-specific factors make the process even harder for many women. For example, women are more likely than men to start service-based or retail businesses, which tend to have larger operational costs than software companies, for example, which might have fewer employees and less overhead. Banks are generally hesitant to loan to businesses with high cost-to-profit ratios right from the start.</p><h3> The resume gap</h3><p> <br/> Another stumbling block for some women is a lack of management or executive-level work experience. Apart from any gender bias that might come into play in corporate hiring and advancement, many female business owners took time to start a family, removing them from the workforce around the time people start making big jumps in their careers. Because of this, many women&rsquo;s backgrounds don&rsquo;t resonate with bankers and other decision makers &mdash; and that can work against them when they&rsquo;re seeking  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/small-business/how-to-get-a-small-business-loan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   small-business loans  </a> </u> .</p><h3> Societal pressures</h3><p> <br/> My female clients often think they have to have a certain aggressive mindset when it comes to business. I teach young girls to have confidence in their abilities: Running a business doesn&rsquo;t mean forgetting who you are, but rather showing off the best aspects of your business sense.</p><p> On the flip side, some women don&rsquo;t ask for the loan amount they need out of fear that they&rsquo;ll be rejected. Playing it safe can result in securing less startup capital.</p><p> Despite these hurdles, there are ways women can get the support and  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/small-business/small-business-funding-business-loan/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   small-business funding  </a> </u>  they need to build their dream businesses.</p><h3> Make your business plan shine</h3><p> <br/> If your business leadership experience doesn&rsquo;t shine through on a resume, it&rsquo;s important to showcase your experience and talent in another way. You can do that by mastering the art of the business plan.</p><p> All lenders require a business plan with each loan application. It must include an executive summary, company description, financial projection statements, market analysis, and cash flow and balance sheet.</p><p> Investors and lenders will be looking for reasons to say no to businesses that require high overhead, such as high labor or facilities costs. Head that off by showing you&rsquo;ve put thought and analysis into your business and have a plan to keep labor and facilities costs low.</p><h3> Find alternative funding and resources</h3><p> <br/> If one of my clients is turned down for a loan, I encourage her to consider smaller loans or sources such as crowdfunding. The  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/loans-grants/find-other-sources-financing\" target=\"_blank\">   Small Business Administration  </a> </u>  also has information on alternatives to bank loans, which could include government loans or grants, and angel or venture capital financing.</p><p> If you need support during the business loan application process, contact the nonprofit organization Score, which connects women with mentors who can help them develop business plans. The National Association of Women Business Owners also offers  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.nawbo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   valuable resources and a membership directory  </a> </u>  that women can use to network and find advisors.</p><p> The National Women&rsquo;s Business Council has  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.nwbc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">   statistics and research data  </a> </u> , along with news about women in business.</p><p> Starting a business is never easy, and women face even more challenges than men do. But with determination and an analytical approach, women who own businesses can overcome these hurdles and soar.</p>",

    "title": "Do You Hear With Your Third Ear?",
    "link": "do-you-hear-with-your-third-ear",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> I have always loved the notion of a Third Eye.</h3><p> <br/> According to chakra symbology, the Third Eye sits right in the center of our forehead. Smack above our eyebrows. It is the place in our body that links to our intuition.  <strong>  It&rsquo;s also the pathway to any psychic powers we may possess. </strong> Cool.</p><p> But a Third Ear? What the heck is that? Joyce F. Brown is the president of the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, one of the preeminent US breeding grounds for future fashionistas. Ms. Brown is also a psychologist. When she was asked what helps her to be a successful leader, Ms. Brown replied with little hesitation: I am convinced that I have a third ear. (New York Times, Business Section, 7/21/2013)</p><p> The third ear, according to Brown, is the ear that hears the nuances. Love that. And the moment I read those two words &ndash; third ear &ndash; I think of the various nuances we hear with our third ear:</p><h3> Nuance IN the spoken word </h3><p> <br/> A few months ago I was settling into a seat on Virgin Air, getting situated for a flight to San Francisco. A fellow strolls by, stops, glances at the seat next to mine and then announces: We&rsquo;re neighboring. </p><p> Wow, I think to myself, what an exquisite phrase that is. Neighboring. A phrase full of nuance and surprise. We quickly engage. My chat with Mark turns out to be, hands-down, the most enriching chat I have ever had with anyone on a plane. It began with a nuanced word.</p><h3> Nuance IN what isn&rsquo;t said </h3><p> <br/> You have had this conversation, right? Your boss offers you a compliment, and she offers it with a good deal of zest: You did a fine job with this report! Nice, until we hear the words that weren&rsquo;t said. It wasn&rsquo;t You did a superb job! It wasn&rsquo;t You did an outstanding job! </p><p> Now, your boss may not be the sort of person that volunteers extravagant praise. I don&rsquo;t propose we second-guess her. But make sure your third ear hears the praise for what it is, not for what you desire it to be. And if you&rsquo;re the boss who wishes to offer extravagant praise, make sure your choice of language reflects your intent.</p><h3> Nuance BENEATH the spoken word </h3><p> <br/> In the early 90s I was trained at the Brooklyn Courts to become a mediator. I value this training more than my Organizational Psychology degree or most other formal learning opportunities I&rsquo;ve had.</p><p> The crux of what I learned: In any remotely difficult conversation, certain core emotions are likely bubbling below the surface. Anger. Frustration. Sadness. Regret. Sometimes these emotions are explicitly expressed through words. Most of the time they are contained. They are always the real language behind the conversations. Want to positively shape a conversation? Activate your third ear. Hear the emotion that is covered up.</p><p> There have been a gazillion moments when I was in conversation and my third ear was shut tight. When it is open, however, it invites me into a more nuanced conversation. A more nuanced conversation is invariably a richer conversation. And isn&rsquo;t that so much more satisfying?</p>",

    "link": "is-the-dol-fiduciary-rule-good-news-for-consumers-or-a-love-tap",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The Department of Labor&rsquo;s groundbreaking new Fiduciary Rule may change the legal responsibilities of advisors who sell financial products for consumers&rsquo; retirement accounts.</p><h3> Financial services industry pundits aren&rsquo;t sure whether the new rule is a giant step in the right direction or a successful dodging of a bullet by Wall Street.</h3><p> <br/> The original intent was to require those selling financial products for retirement plans to act as  <u>  <a href=\"http://kahlerfinancial.com/financial-awakenings/weekly-column/defining-fiduciary-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   fiduciaries  </a> </u> &mdash;advisors required to put clients&rsquo; interests ahead of their own. One proposed provision was a &ldquo;restricted asset list&rdquo; which would have banned the sale of high-commission products like private REITs and annuities to IRAs and other retirement plans. Wall Street brokers were &ldquo;expecting a punch in the face that would force a dramatic overhaul of how they dealt with their customers,&rdquo; notes Joshua Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, in an April 6 <a href=\"http://fortune.com/author/joshua-brown/?iid=sr-link1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  article </a>  at Fortune.com.</p><p> As adopted, the final rule allows financial salespeople to still sell all the controversial illiquid high-commissioned products they currently sell, as long as the brokerage firm can document the product is in the client&rsquo;s best interest. Brown says this amounts to a &ldquo;love tap.&rdquo;</p><p> Bob Veres, editor of Inside Information, sees the new Fiduciary Rule as still a big win for consumers and fiduciary advisors. In an April 8 column, he writes, &ldquo;professional financial planners and advisors have achieved a victory, and the Wall Street and independent broker-dealer service models have been dealt a blow.&rdquo;</p><p> Veres argues that the new fiduciary duty to act in the client&rsquo;s best interest will by itself preclude financial salespeople from justifying the sale of high-commissioned products in IRAs. He also points out that salespeople will no longer be allowed to receive &ldquo;fat commissions&rdquo; for recommending annuities and non-traded REITS, and therefore are unlikely to recommend these products.</p><p> Financial planner and writer  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/best-interests-contract-exemption-bice-and-dol-fiduciary-bic-requirements/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Michael Kitces  </a> </u>  suggests the DOL&rsquo;s concession allowing the current questionable financial products to still be purchased by IRAs may be &ldquo;a brilliantly executed strategy of conceding to the financial services industry the exact parts that didn&rsquo;t actually matter in the long run, . . . yet keeping the key components that mattered the most,&rdquo; the fiduciary duty to the client.</p><p> Brown believes salespeople will continue recommending higher-cost products &ldquo;so long as a justification can be made for their being recommended (quality, performance, etc.).&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;Advisors will still be able to sell the proprietary products of their own firm so long as they can enunciate the reason why these products are in their customers&rsquo; &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; &ndash; a hurdle whose height will probably be adjusted on a case-by-case basis as no one really knows what it means yet.&rdquo;</p><p> Kitces contends the new law will ultimately give consumers the power through the courts to define what is and isn&rsquo;t in their best interests. He points out, &ldquo;In other words, while the DOL fiduciary rule didn&rsquo;t outright regulate what Wall Street can and cannot do, it did change the legal standard by which those actions will be judged and ensure that eventually the courts will have the opportunity to rule on these fiduciary conflicts.&rdquo;</p><h3> While the new rule only applies to retirement assets, Veres and Brown see it as a step toward requiring a fiduciary standard for all investment advice. I tend to agree.</h3><p> <br/> Since so many small investors hold retirement accounts, applying a fiduciary standard to those investments may help more consumers understand the difference between fiduciary advisors and product salespeople. As the industry moves toward full compliance with the rule by the April 2017 deadline, we may see an increase in consumer demand for financial advisors who put clients&rsquo; interests first.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In such a globally connected world, people try to market to anyone and everyone. Although, in the process of doing so, they lose sight of their local audience. When strategizing your marketing, a one-size-fits-all approach is not the way to go. According to a study done by the  <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/11/what-kinds-of-local-stories-drive-engagement-the-results-of-an-npr-facebook-experiment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  National Public Radio (NPR) </a> , localized content had 6 times more Facebook shares than non-localized content.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s digitally-centric world, there is an overwhelming amount of online content at our disposal. Consumer needs have shifted; when searching for a product, they now look for the most personalized, relevant and relatable information that meets their interests</p><p> According to  <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/6-local-seo-stats-every-online-marketer-needs-know-226562\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Search Engine Land </a> , 67% of smartphone user&rsquo;s want ads customized by city and 61% want ads customized to their immediate surroundings.</p><p> Now, more than ever, local marketing will benefit your business. Here are some ways a localized marketing strategy can benefit you:</p><h3> Less competitors</h3><p> <br/> When you focus on localized marketing &ndash; you are targeting a smaller audience. However, you are also competing against a smaller number of businesses. Less competition means a higher chance of attracting and landing clients!</p><h3> Increase in traffic</h3><p> <br/> Not only will you get business from people passing by your office, localized marketing can help you better reach your local target audience through search engine optimization (SEO). For example, if you are a Financial Advisor within the Toronto region &ndash; you are more likely to appear in search engine results if someone were to search &ldquo;Financial Advisor Toronto&rdquo; as opposed to just &ldquo;Financial Advisor&rdquo;. Optimizing for local SEO will help you increase your online traffic, which in turn, can help improve your global SEO rankings as well.</p><h3> Improves client experience</h3><p> <br/> As digital as our world is today, consumers still like to have face-to-face interactions &ndash; it helps to build trust. Today&rsquo;s consumers prefer to work with someone that is easily accessible, online and off. As a Financial Advisor, providing your clients with different options for interaction with your business will improve their overall experience with you.</p><h3> Helps build referrals</h3><p> <br/> Just as people refer local mechanics to their friends, they will do just that with Financial Advisors. By building strong relationships with your local clients, the chances of them referring your services to their friends and family increases &ndash; or even better, referring your business to an online audience by leaving a review.</p><h3> Increases your online reviews</h3><p> <br/> According to  <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/88-consumers-trust-online-reviews-much-personal-recommendations-195803\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Search Engine Land </a> , 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. With an increase in consumers searching for information on a local level, having numerous, positive reviews can set your business apart from the rest. One positive review can convert a prospect into a client within seconds.</p><p> Consumer needs are constantly evolving. Localized marketing can help you target the right clients, on a local level, while helping you build a more trusted and valuable relationship with them. Overtime, localized marketing can help you grow your relationships and business.</p>",

    "link": "the-reality-of-the-robo-invasion-isnt-what-advisers-think-why-i-am-betting-on-advisers",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It is almost impossible for advisers to go through a day without hearing how robo-advisers are shaking the foundation of their industry &mdash; and changing how their clients get financial advice. According to much of the industry commentary and media coverage, advisers should duck for cover and run for the hills in the face of an inevitable &ldquo;robo-invasion.&rdquo;</p><p> But the findings from  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.jeffnat.com/advisorauthority\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   our recent Advisor Authority Study,  </a> </u>  commissioned by Jefferson National and conducted online by Harris Poll among more than 500 RIAs and fee-based advisers nationwide, show a very different reality. Rather than a threat, today's new generation of robo-advisers can be a valuable tool to help advisers grow their practice and better serve their clients. In fact, the most successful advisers understand that digital advisory solutions such as robo-advisers are an important part of a comprehensive offering.</p><h3> A Different Reality</h3><p> <br/> While many believe that robos are keeping advisers up at night, the findings from Advisor Authority show a very different reality. The study found that one-tenth of RIAs and fee-based advisers have never even heard of robo-advisers. Roughly one-third say they only know the term, and only one-quarter were very familiar with the robo-advice model.</p><p> Just as awareness is low, adoption is slow among advisers as a whole, according to the study. Of those advisers who are familiar with robo-advice, only one-third currently use any type of robo in their practice. Of those not currently using robo-advice, just 15% are very likely to integrate this model into their practice in the coming year.</p><p> While this may seem surprising, the reality is that robo-advisers still make up a relatively small segment of the industry's total assets under management. Their share is projected to reach $55 billion to $60 billion by year-end 2015 in a wealth management market that is valued at more than $18 trillion, according to Aite Group.</p><h3> Adding Value for Clients &mdash; and Growing Your Practice</h3><p> <br/> Robo-advisers are not a new concept. Since the advent of the Internet, technology has been used to disintermediate the entire value chain in financial services. Over the years, there have been many digital financial solutions that could be considered the first incarnation of robo-advisers, including online brokers such as ETrade, Schwab and Fidelity.</p><p> Many of these companies developed low-cost online tools to help self-directed investors build and accumulate wealth for the future. Today, we're seeing the next generation of robo-advisers, such as Wealthfront and Betterment, which have moved beyond basic investing and trading tools to providing an automated process for risk profile assessment, portfolio allocation and regular rebalancing.</p><p> Many advisers simply view robo-advice as a solution for younger clients with lower assets under management. After all, a low-cost, fully automated portfolio allocation tool with lower minimum investment requirements provides obvious benefits for emerging investors looking to make their first move into the market. By keeping costs low and creating greater efficiencies, robo-advice can help these younger clients build more wealth more quickly.</p><p> Over time, as these clients accumulate more wealth, their financial needs become more complex. They will ultimately require your guided advice and a more sophisticated wealth management approach. In this way, robo-advice can be an effective solution for growing your practice.</p><h3> A Tool for Top Advisers &mdash; and HNW Clients</h3><p> <br/> Beyond serving entry-level investors, robo-advice can provide powerful solutions at any point in the investing cycle, as shown clearly by our study. Top advisers are more likely to be familiar with robo-advisers and more likely to be early adopters than their counterparts. For example, the study found that 43% of high-earning advisers and 47% of advisers with high AUM say they are extremely or very familiar with the model, compared to 25% of advisers overall.</p><p> More than half of the early adopters using robo-advice report that they use it for clients with more than $1 million in investible assets&mdash;and a full 20% say that they use it most often for clients with over $10 million in investible assets.</p><p> Given that clients with more assets have more complex financial profiles, it is likely that robo-advice would be used for only the portion of their portfolio that is low-cost and buy and hold, with regular rebalancing. This would be part of a more sophisticated portfolio that could include alternative assets and tactically managed investments&mdash;and part of a more holistic financial plan that includes such services as risk management, tax strategies, estate planning, legacy planning and charitable giving.</p><h3> Know Your Robos</h3><p> <br/> Our study shows that the most successful advisers are &ldquo;tech-obsessed.&rdquo; For example, advisers who manage more AUM spend more on technology&mdash;and use more technology&mdash;to make their job more seamless. These advisers know that technology helps re-engineer every step of the advising, investing and practice management process. It can empower you with greater capabilities to analyze and understand the state of the market&mdash;and the state of a client's assets&mdash;more accurately than ever before. It can optimize resources to help you build and maintain a more successful practice. In fact, for the most successful advisers, the only thing more expensive than adding technology is not adding technology.</p><p> Today there is an ongoing evolution of technology in general, and robo-advisers in particular. So get to know your robo counterparts&mdash;and you'll find that they aren't foes. Instead, they can help you to be more efficient and cost-effective. They can give you more time to focus on building relationships, providing specialized services and offering more holistic advice so you can better serve current clients&mdash;and bring on new clients&mdash;in today's highly competitive market.</p><p> Robo-advice can complement your practice, but it's no replacement for holistic financial advice. As clients begin to build wealth, the need for guided advice grows. And in the end, people still want to talk to people. They still want the human touch. Robo-advice is starting to gain momentum, but I'm still betting on advisers.</p><h3> Learn more about Jefferson National  <u>  <a href=\"https://www.jeffnat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   here  </a> </u> .</h3>",

    "link": "3-reasons-your-employees-dont-want-to-be-leaders",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A company would have to be crazy to think that leadership isn&rsquo;t a crucial element to their organization. However, many companies believe they aren&rsquo;t investing enough effort in leadership training and ensuring there is a clear leadership pipeline. You don&rsquo;t have to be a fortune-teller to see that these shortcomings can cause the downfall of a company.</p><p> According to Deloitte and CareerBuilder:</p><li> <strong>  Only 6% of organizations believe their leadership pipeline is &ldquo;very ready&rdquo; </strong></li><li> <strong>  Only 18% of companies hold leaders accountable to identify and develop successors </strong></li><li> <strong>  Only 34% of workers aspire to leadership positions, and only 7% aim to become a senior or C-level manager </strong> <br/>  </li><p> Combine those first two stats with the last one, and you&rsquo;ll clearly see that leadership is a massive problem. If employees don&rsquo;t want to become leaders and no one is training leaders, you&rsquo;re going to be in a situation one day where there is no clear person in charge.</p><p> The best solution is to identify and tackle why your employees don&rsquo;t want to be leaders.</p><h3> <strong>  1. No work-life balance </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many people don&rsquo;t want to be burdened with longer hours and less home life when they make it into senior leadership. In the CareerBuilder survey, 34% of respondents said they weren&rsquo;t interested in leadership positions because &ldquo;I would have to work more hours and have less work-life balance.&rdquo;</p><p> This is something your company can fix. Embed into the culture a value of work-life balance. Ensure that leadership training emphasizes this value and mitigate any fears in every step along the leadership pipeline. Often this lack of a work-life balance is an imagined fear instead of a real one, so combat it from the beginning.</p><h3> <strong>  2. Lack of leadership skill sets </strong></h3><p> <br/> Many employees believe they don&rsquo;t have what it takes to be leaders. CareerBuilder reports that 21% said they don&rsquo;t have the right academic degrees to take on a leadership role, and 16% think they don&rsquo;t have the right skill sets. These numbers speak to a fundamental gap in your leadership pipeline. Employees should be taking small steps along their career to reach leadership potential, and every one of those steps should include training to enhance their leadership qualities. This way, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a leap from an employee&rsquo;s current role to a management position.</p><p> Your company probably already values personal and job skills over academic degrees. Be sure to make that value clear in your culture. Reward employees for a job well done with a recognition program.</p><h3> <strong>  3. No leadership opportunities </strong></h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s clear from the bulleted statistics above that companies are in desperate need of leaders. So no employee should ever think that they are not wanted. According to CareerBuilder, 14% of employees said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think my business would even give me the opportunity&rdquo; to advance into a leadership position.</p><p> A whopping one in five workers thinks their company has a glass ceiling, but that number gets even higher: 33% of women see a glass ceiling; 34% of Hispanics, 50% of African Americans, 59% of workers with disabilities, and 21% of LGBTQ workers.</p><p> Clearly many companies have work to do, showcasing in their culture a value of all workers. For this, your leadership must be representative: full of women, minorities, people with disabilities, and others.</p><p> There&rsquo;s a major leadership gap problem in companies. To fill these roles, it&rsquo;s important that your company addresses the three major concerns workers have about becoming leaders.</p>",

These special individuals had a few things in common... Passion, grit, determination and an unfaltering belief that they could just sell product to anyone anywhere at any time. To the individuals in financial services who think that they can survive -going forward- by selling products in a vacuum, we have to let you know this ... being a broker is no longer an admirable position. In fact, some people... investors... may start to ask you a few questions that you aren't quite prepared to answer. In case you are wondering if you fall into the category of  \"broker\" we have come up with some Jeff Foxworthy-like phrases that may let you know if you are about to be replaced.</p><p> <strong>  If you've ever sold a C share to a client to make your bogey... you might be a broker. </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you've ever sold a VA to an 80 year old widow... you might be a broker. </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you've ever torn off the cover of a prospectus and sent it to a client... you might be a broker.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you've ever sold an acronym in a wirehouse... you might be a broker. </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you've ever charged a client over 10% of the value of a transaction... you might be a broker.  </strong></p><p> <strong>  If you've ever not returned a client call because you didn't know what to say... you might be a broker.  </strong></p><p> And so on and so forth...</p><p> There are a lot of brokers in the financial services industry that might take umbrage to these pithy phrases. (That means you no like) And to them I say this... <strong>  If you are not proving yourself to be a steward to your clients in a tangible fashion, your days are numbered  </strong> ... and for that, I a most grateful.</p><p> The day is upon us... your value as a product salesperson for the gain of shareholder value is dying a death deserved for the transgressions you have bestowed upon your clients. But there is salvation. There is great value placed on the wisdom you have accumulated through the years.</p><p> There is a void however... a small rub that may give you pause...</p><p> How will you explain to your clients that you have been self-serving asshole for the past decade? We can help you with that.  Also ... why would anyone pay you for your wisdom? We can help you with that too. If you are interested in becoming a client-centered steward of wealth who can justify your value to your clients, we have a great opportunity for you...</p><p> <a href=\"https://advisorcrunch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  100% confidential and 100% free.  </a> Learn how to become irreplaceable in the digital age of transparency. If you choose to not take advantage of our free services ... you might still be a broker. </p><p> Thanks for reading my rant...</p>",

    "content": "<h3> Ever since <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/the-first-google-doodle-was-a-burning-man-stick-figure/279416/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  1998 </a> , the Google Doodle has provided a perfect outlet for the company to show off its fun side.</h3><p> <br/> From <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/112th-birthday-of-jorge-luis-borges\" target=\"_blank\">  birthday celebrations </a> to playable <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man\" target=\"_blank\">  video games </a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/nellie-blys-151st-birthday\" target=\"_blank\">  original songs </a> , these iconic images paint Google as more than just a typical conglomerate. Instead, they show the world that Google is comprised of a creative and diverse group of individuals who all bring different experiences, passions, and narratives to the table. What started as a small office joke has turned to a cultural phenomenon.</p><p> Google didn't just stumble upon this gem of creativity. They knew exactly what they were doing: Driving innovation through playful design.</p><p> The idea behind Google Doodle isn't rare. In fact, these ideas happen all the time at companies everywhere. Google is just one of the few companies that allows these bursts of creativity to become a reality, and this once quick and fun endeavor has now transformed into a full-time job.</p><p> Last month, Google announced <a href=\"http://time.com/3883235/google-doodle-job-opening/\" target=\"_blank\">  an opening </a> on its Doodle team, implying there&rsquo;s currently a group of &ldquo;professional doodlers&rdquo; working for one of America&rsquo;s most successful corporations. This might sound frivolous and whimsical, but it&rsquo;s actually ingenious.</p><p> The Google Doodle is a metaphor for Google&rsquo;s spirit. It&rsquo;s an illustrative bellwether of the company&rsquo;s inclusiveness, innovation, and individualism. The very fact that the Doodle exists &mdash; and that it&rsquo;s a full-time pursuit &mdash; shows that Google values creative undertakings and social leadership more than its bottom line.</p><p> With top-down executive support, Google Doodle lays a brave groundwork for fun, playfulness, and a unique brand identity through design.</p><p> So why aren&rsquo;t you hiring a &ldquo;chief doodler&rdquo; or a &ldquo;director of magic&rdquo;?</p><h3> <strong>  The Importance of Being Playful </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your company isn&rsquo;t a fussy, fragile entity. It&rsquo;s a profoundly resilient structure comprised of incredible humans who share a powerful vision. The greatest companies know how to transform this human resource into power, while the timid ones sit on the sidelines paralyzed by risk.</p><p> Look what happened to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/technology/02kodak.html?_r=1&amp;\" target=\"_blank\">  Kodak </a> : The once proud film giant had a golden opportunity to pioneer the digital photography movement decades before anyone else, but it was too scared to do anything about it. One of its employees created the first digital camera, but Kodak ignored this innovation and waited for other companies to embrace the new technology. And now, the company is a shell of its former self.</p><p> Your organization can and should champion its fun and deeply unique ideas. They&rsquo;re cheap to manifest, and I&rsquo;m sure your teams are overflowing with them. One of the best ways to cultivate this innovative, creative culture is to encourage playfulness. </p><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Organizational playfulness  </a> </u> means more than adding some foosball tables to the break room and having Nerf guns on every desk. Rather, it means encouraging risky ideas and supporting design thinking from top to bottom.</p><p> The purpose of play is to create a better understanding of the world through experimentation, simulation, and exploration. Businesses pay millions of dollars to better understand the world while overlooking the vast resources they have within each employee.</p><h3> <strong>  Finding Your Doodle </strong></h3><p> <br/> Playfulness, innovation, and around-the-clock creativity may not be your top priority &mdash; and that&rsquo;s totally fine. Not all companies need to doodle, but every company could certainly benefit from a mindset shift.</p><p> If your company relies on a <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/six-sigma-killed-innovation-in-3m/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  rigid structure </a> and seniority pyramid, you definitely need to reevaluate your priorities. The world is changing fast, and technology has eliminated the need for human robots. Today, we need creative thinkers and bold decision makers.</p><p> Hand the reins to your risk-takers and prolific makers. Their skills will take your firm in new directions at a faster pace. Give them the space to play, and consistently measure the success of their products.</p><p> Companies that operate in top-down paranoia have no room to deviate from the norm. They will never find an innovative path, they&rsquo;ll struggle with product development, and they&rsquo;ll ultimately be consumed by fast movers who aren&rsquo;t afraid of change.</p><p> The Doodle isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s directly making Google tons of money, but it represents something everyone needs to take to heart: creative innovation through playful experimentation. </p>",

    "title": "13 Reasons Why Your Pitch Book Stinks",
    "link": "13-reasons-why-your-pitch-book-stinks",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Are you having earned success or bad luck with creating and presenting your pitch book to potential investors? Don&rsquo;t know what your pitch book&rsquo;s blind spots are?</p><p> 13 things your sales deck may be missing &ndash; and what to do about it.</p><h3> <strong>  1.  It&rsquo;s Too Long </strong></h3><p> <br/> Marketing guru Guy Kawasaki says 10 slides - or 10 concepts - are all you need to make your point with decision makers. Other marketing shops may differ; for example, many decks produced by Charles Schwab, HubSpot, and Google, for example, may run to 75 or 80 slides. But many of the slides are one-sentence quotes, or disclaimer pages, or help explain complex concepts. Key points may be how much time the presentation takes and the engagement it engenders, not how many pages it is.</p><h3> <strong>  2. It&rsquo;s Not About Helping Build a Relationship </strong></h3><p> <br/> If your pitch book is not about helping you establish and grow a relationship with your prospective clients, then your sales deck may not be helping you achieve your sales objective. Don&rsquo;t even pull out your pitch book at the beginning of a meeting. Just sit down and talk to the prospect. And then point them to specific parts of your book that are relevant within the flow of the conversation.</p><h3> <strong>  3. It's Too Crowded </strong></h3><p> <br/> How many presentations have you seen that have charts, pictures, clip art, bullet points, paragraphs of text, multiple typefaces, and tiny type &ndash; all on one slide? Well, that&rsquo;s one way to keep the presentation to ten pages.  The net impact, however, is client confusion. Prospects don't know where to look first, so maybe they don&rsquo;t look.</p><h3> <strong>  4. It Has No Clear Value Proposition </strong></h3><p> <br/> &ldquo;Why you, why now, why this investment&rdquo; are all part of the value proposition equation. The challenge, beyond saying you are different, or more experienced, or more nimble than others, is to show how you are different.</p><h3> <strong>  5. It Has No Discussion of Risk Management </strong></h3><p> <br/> Part of the value prop many decision makers also want to know up front is how you seek to manage and mitigate risk. If you deliver a pitch without a discussion of risk, you&rsquo;re risking not being heard.</p><h3> <strong>  6. It Lacks Competitive Intelligence </strong></h3><p> <br/> Investors have options, and will want salient information on your competitors, and on your firm&rsquo;s critical advantages.</p><h3> <strong>  7. It&rsquo;s all Bullets </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> No</li><li> Not today.</li><li> Not ever.</li><p> An occasional set of bullet points may help get your point across, but an entire presentation of text and bullet, while perhaps reminding you want you want to say and in what order, may thwart your audience&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p><h3> <strong>  8. It Has No Soul </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your pitch should speak to your audience&rsquo;s emotions through a compelling narrative. Facts and figures on investment strategy are requisite, of course, but should not be the entire book.</p><h3> <strong>  9. It's Visually Vacuous </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your prospective investors have probably seen plenty of presentations (50, 100, 200?) before yours. Obvious stock images are a yawner, and likely won&rsquo;t help your sales proposition.</p><h3> <strong>  10. Its Charts Make No Sense </strong></h3><p> <br/> Your charts, tables, graphs should be intuitive &ndash; easy to understand. If your investors can&rsquo;t understand the graphics without you explaining it in person, you may have to go back to the drawing board.</p><h3> <strong>  11. It has No Pull Quotes </strong></h3><p> <br/> A pull quote is a key line, thought, or takeaway shown as a separate slide in the presentation. Yes, it's an additional slide, but a separate slide seeks to reinforce your main point while providing a visual resting place for the audience.</p><h3> <strong>  12. It&rsquo;s Obviously Home-Brewed </strong></h3><p> <br/> We get it, many start ups and plateaued investment managers think of marketing content as a discretionary cost, with no clear return on investment &ndash; and as a way to conserve cost by doing it themselves. The result, however, is often a perhaps somewhat less than professional presentation of your image.</p><h3> <strong>  13. It&rsquo;s Not Compliant </strong></h3><p> <br/> We see many first drafts of pitch books that have left off the favorite part of in-house counsel or the compliance team: the disclosure statements. If the fund is for accredited investors only, your deck should so state. Disclaimers should detail risks. Indices should be cited. Outside data should be sourced. Text should be 8-point type at minimum. Text should be proximate to what is being disclaimed. The fund&rsquo;s objectives and terms should be consistent from the legal documents to the sales materials. And past performance, of course, does not guarantee future similar results.</p><p> As we've said before, generating leads to help raise capital may also depend on a website that attracts, on eBooks that educate, on emails that speak to prospects wherever they are in the sales process, and on breadth and depth of content that positions a manager as a informed source.</p>",

    "link": "the-3-reasons-why-you-should-stop-reading-top-10-lists",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We have loved numbered lists since the beginning of time.</p><h3> If the Ten Commandments had been written today it would show up in your Facebook feed as &ldquo;The 10 Things Every Good Person Does.&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> While the Ten Commandments provide an excellent list for the basic dos and don&rsquo;ts to live a moral life it unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t get specific on &ldquo;The 5 things every leader needs to know&rdquo; or &ldquo;The 6 ways to retain customer loyalty.&rdquo; Granted, Thou Shalt Not Kill is as good a place as any to bolster employee engagement, but we want specifics. Time is precious. Tell us what to do and how to do it, and fast. We don&rsquo;t want to make a mistake.</p><p> The recent upswing of numbered lists allegedly gives you a fail-safe guide for success, but I&rsquo;d like to suggest that this is not possible, and I&rsquo;d like to give you 3 reasons why:</p><h3> 1. Things Change. </h3><p> <br/> Everything is in flux. You just aged since you read the former sentence and your entire cellular make-up changed as well. While some things remain more or less inconvertibly true, some do not, and most never get resolved. For instance:</p><p> Is soy bad for us or is it good for us? Should we eat margarine or butter? Does Sweet n Low cause cancer? Does anti-perspirant cause Alzheimer&rsquo;s? </p><p> When it comes to your company, how do you know if what was best yesterday is right for you today? The #1 thing successful leaders do every day (from a list of 15 things) on Forbes.com, is &ldquo;Make Others Feel Safe to Speak-Up.&rdquo; In theory I would suggest that too, and yet I could also foresee a &ldquo;too many cooks in the kitchen&rdquo; scenario and possibly muddle what was once a clear-cut decision in your mind.</p><p> Maybe an open door policy once worked for you and your employees but now most of the original employees have moved on to other jobs and the new crew abuses the policy. Do you keep it in place even if a numbered list says it&rsquo;s one of the 7 things you must do?</p><p> Though overused, it&rsquo;s always good to remember Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s famous advice, &ldquo;a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.&rdquo;</p><h3> 2. What works for one doesn&rsquo;t necessarily work for another.</h3><p> <br/> If Bob jumps off the empire state building are you going to? I know that&rsquo;s a childish point, but the sentiment rings true. How many successful leaders and entrepreneurs do you think became successful because they adhered to a list they read on the Internet?</p><p> Better yet, how many do you think achieved a certain degree of success after reading a list of 5 things they had to do to become successful, and then they became more successful when they read a list of 6 things, and then they really hit the top of their industry when they read the 7 things list?</p><h3> 3. Why 5? Or 6? Or 10? Or 9?</h3><p> <br/> <strong>  The truth is I don&rsquo;t have a #3, I just thought 3 sounded better than 2, and that&rsquo;s also the point of making this a list of three. </strong></p><p> Who decided there were 8 things successful people do? And do all successful people do all 8 things all the time? If they&rsquo;re doing 8 then what about the other successful person who is doing 15 and the other successful leader who is only doing 5?</p><p> What&rsquo;s the right list? How many things does a successful leader do?</p><p> The number is arbitrary. Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;The TEN Commandments&rdquo; sound better than &ldquo;The 9 Commandments?&rdquo; Or what if they were &ldquo;The 8 and sometimes 9 commandments depending on the person?&rdquo; Would that list be as convincing or eye-catching as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?</p><p> Numbered lists &ndash; and lists in general &ndash; format information in a way that our brains like. It&rsquo;s compartmentalized, it&rsquo;s visual, it&rsquo;s clean. It&rsquo;s easier to remember the information. We know what we&rsquo;re getting, which is a huge advantage when you scroll through an endless Facebook feed.</p><p> In 2011, Psychologists Claude Messner and Michaela W&auml;nke discovered that we feel better when we have to work less to process information. A list reduces the amount of work we have to do.</p><p> We&rsquo;re also more likely to complete the article and completing the article makes us feel good. We&rsquo;re thus more likely to click on a numbered list again, recalling the time we felt so good when we completed the last numbered list.</p><p> We are all born with instinct yet some of us never know whether to trust it or not. Though your neurochemistry tells you it feels good to adhere to a numbered list, it&rsquo;s important to cultivate your intuition through trial and error.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t let a numbered list replace your ability to make decisions (And don&rsquo;t call me a hypocrite me when I write a numbered list blog post in the future, because I will.)</p><p> Of course don&rsquo;t ignore facts, and do learn from others, but craft your own leadership style. Try things out, see what works for you and what doesn&rsquo;t. Once you figure out what&rsquo;s imperative for success, please tell us how many things there are and publish the list!</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Physicality&mdash;posture, facial expressions, body language, and movement style&mdash;streams big data about what we think and feel. For leaders, that data is received by many, magnifying its impact.</p><p> Yet most lack awareness about the impact of their non-verbal messaging until or unless it gets pointed out, which may or may not happen. After all, how much feedback do we get about our physicality or body language?</p><p> Those who &ldquo;get it&rdquo; and take charge of it turn it into an asset: They discover even modest physicality changes result in key upgrades to executive presence, charisma, podium skills, and even following and trust among colleagues.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s background and a &ldquo;larger than life&rdquo; exercise to help build consciousness and selectivity about your physicality.</p><h3> Why physicality and body language are both important</h3><p> <br/> It&rsquo;s not news that body language is 80% of communication. Above and beyond that, \"physicality,\" is the bigger picture of how your physical presence and habits impact those around you.</p><p> Think about it: If someone were to imitate you, what would they definitely do, physically, in that impression of you?</p><p> Now consider a public figure or leader you admire. Watch some video of them with the sound muted. What does their physicality communicate about them? In what ways does it help them have more impact? Did they likely have to learn that?</p><p> Generally, yes. After all, we're not born with our physicality&mdash;we develop it over the years like a suit of our experiences. And as we begin to understand that, we can take charge of it, almost like choosing what to wear. Then as we make new choices, we communicate at a non-verbal level more clearly the authentic brand and leadership we&rsquo;d like to build.</p><h3> So what?</h3><p> <br/> If your eyes are the windows on your soul, then your physicality is the instant messenger of what you&rsquo;re actually saying, and even may wish you could say aloud. That &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is being read by your colleagues.</p><p> Consider the executive who hears surprisingly disappointing results from someone on her team, and, while planning her response by choosing her words carefully, she starts gripping tightly the arms of her chair. What&rsquo;s the impact of her doing that?</p><p> Consider an executive who walks quickly everywhere, even into the boardroom. A board member said, \"He's got all the smarts and experience for the top job, but he makes us a bit nervous.\" Does he realize something simple like the speed of his walk can make others concerned?</p><p> So that leg you&rsquo;re prone to bouncing under the table is making your people uneasy. That pen top you&rsquo;re clicking is sending Morse code for &ldquo;Get on with it,&rdquo; and that nature break you waited too long to take, the one that caused you to walk quickly out of the strategy session without explanation, makes half the room wonder if there&rsquo;s a crisis brewing.</p><p> Bottom line: If you are an executive or emerging leader, you are indeed larger than life because your physicality is watched and read in a highly magnified manner by others.</p><h3> Now what?</h3><p> <br/> Changing your physicality takes awareness, intention, and practice. To make it authentic, there's no quick fix, but there are things you can do, starting with this &ldquo;larger than life&rdquo; exercise I ask some of my executive coaching clients to try, and it works well for them:</p><p> <strong>  In the next two to three meetings you attend&mdash;either one on one, or with a group, I&rsquo;d like you to imagine you are a giant. </strong> Your body and everything you bring with you (laptop, smartphone, notepad, etc.) are giant-sized. Your laptop is three feet tall and four feet wide, your face and hands are enormous, and your smartphone the size of a laptop.</p><p> As a \"giant,\" what do you notice about the impact of your physicality, gestures, and device usage, how you&rsquo;re sitting, walking, holding yourself, and so on? What do you want your physicality to communicate? What messages are you sending?</p><p> Imagine everything you do with your body, and your stuff, is gigantic in the eyes of your colleagues and you will be much more thoughtful about your physicality and the brand and leadership you are creating. It works.</p>",

The vast majority of these people and things will be out of our lives long before their perceived benefit is ever realized.</p><p> People come in and out of our lives like waiters in a restaurant, and the things we &ldquo;can&rsquo;t live without&rdquo; eventually prove themselves unworthy of the title.</p><p> We strive so hard to please our employers, to be looked upon in favor by our wealthier neighbors, to be admired by fans, or to be lusted after by the masses. However when we truly follow the course of such ambitions, we find dead-ends down nearly every pathway. Bosses move on, neighbors move away, fans soon forget, and the masses don&rsquo;t give a shit to begin with.</p><h3> The only people that really matter are you and your immediate loved ones. The only things that matter are your values and your dreams.</h3><p> <br/> Most people and every thing in our lives are like fingernail, toenails and hair. We worry about them, we groom them, we spend time and money on them. In the final analysis, we must cut and clip them.</p><p> Our immediate loved ones, our values, and our dreams are akin to our heart, brain, and internal organs. Without these, we no longer exist. We don&rsquo;t outgrow them and we can never cut or clip them. They linger. They stalk.</p><h3> They are eternal.</h3><p> <br/> But not unlike the population who spends a their time grooming and coloring the temporary and a scarce amount on the permanent, we too spend more time on the pleasure of others and the capture of stuff than we do on living our values and chasing our dreams.</p><p> Don&rsquo;t believe me? How much time did you spend today working on your appearance or working extra just to buy more stuff? Compare that with the time you spent with your children?</p><p> Chasing a dream?</p><p> Reflecting on your childhood?</p><p> Helping another?</p><p> That&rsquo;s what I thought.</p><p> Emile Henry Gauvreau said it best, &ldquo; I was part of that strange race of people aptly described as spending their lives doing things they detest to make money they don&rsquo;t want to buy things they don&rsquo;t need to impress people they don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p><p> It&rsquo;s time to reengineer the very structure of our lives, to remove our heads from our proverbial asses, to question everything about who we are and what we stand for.</p><p> Otherwise go ahead, enjoy those new shoes while they last. Feign self-importance in front of those &ldquo;cool&rdquo; neighbors.</p><p> For now, I have to go. There&rsquo;s a dream to catch, and my son wants to play catch.</p>",

Search engine optimization (SEO), according to  <a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Hubspot </a> , refers to techniques that help your website rank higher in organic (or &ldquo;natural&rdquo;) search results, thus making your website more visible to people who are looking for your product or service via search engines. Everyone in marketing knows that SEO is important for ensuring that your product or service is ranked high enough to create traffic to your website.</p><p> However, it gets a little deeper than that. SEO is part of the broader topic of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), a term used to describe all marketing strategies for search. SEM entails both organic and paid search. With paid search, you can pay to list your website on a search engine so that your website shows up when someone types in a specific keyword or phrase. Organic and paid listings both appear on the search engine, but they are displayed in different locations on the page.</p><p> So, why is it important for your business&rsquo; website to be listed on search engines? On Google alone,there are over 694,000 searches conducted every second. Every single second! Woah, that&rsquo;s a lot of searches! Think about it. Every second that your website is not indexed on Google, you are potentially missing out on hundreds, if not thousands of opportunities for someone to visit your website, read your content, and potentially buy your product or service.</p><p> Before jumping onto the bandwagon that content marketing is just another cost, however, understand that Americans spend over 10 hours a day consuming content across media platforms, according to a recent  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/04/content-marketing-costs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Content Marketing Institute </a>  article. To reach your target audience, it&rsquo;s critical to be where they are. Creating content across a variety of media formats that are integrated into an overall marketing plan can efficiently meet a range of prospect and customer needs while eliminating duplicate efforts and reducing costs.</p><p> It&rsquo;s difficult to estimate specific cost reductions content marketing can bring to your company because every company&rsquo;s structures and spending habits differ. However, here are examples compliments of  <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/04/content-marketing-costs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Content Marketing Institute </a>  that show how content marketing provides lower cost alternatives:</p><h3> <strong>  INCREASES BRANDING </strong></h3><p> <br/> Regardless of where your content appears, it supports your branding efforts, often with lower creation costs and lower media costs. To this end, it&rsquo;s important to have branding guidelines and integrate your content marketing needs and plans with your branding initiatives.</p><h3> <strong>  EXPANDS AUDIENCE FOR YOUR OFFERING </strong></h3><p> <br/> Whether your content marketing appears on your internal media, third-party media sites or social media sites, it extends your potential market reach. Even better, it can be enhanced with the use of social sharing to yield earned media impressions. Of course, this strategy yields the greatest savings when the content is self-hosted since it reduces the cost of third-party media.</p><h3> <strong>  SUPPORTS PURCHASE PROCESS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Wherever they buy, most consumers do some form of online research before purchasing. Detailed product information, instructions and related content give customers answers they&rsquo;re seeking to make a decision. If you don&rsquo;t provide this information, your competitors will.</p><h3> <strong>  AIDS SEARCH OPTIMIZATION </strong></h3><p> <br/> Keyword-rich content marketing such as expanded product descriptions, FAQs, blog posts, photographs and videos with related descriptions is an integral part of most search marketing plans.</p><h3> <strong>  ENGAGES FANS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Support your best customers by giving them additional ways to interact with your product. Options include providing more information about your products that have an understated selling message.</p><h3> <strong>  LEVERAGE CUSTOMER-GENERATED CONTENT </strong></h3><p> <br/> To enhance the authenticity of your content, add customer-created content. Since only a very tiny percentage of consumers participate, use formats that require limited customer input while also limiting potential negative feedback.</p><p> Examples include customer galleries for photogenic products like travels and scrapbooking and customer reviews that can leverage third-party technologies.</p><h3> <strong>  GIVES PR EFFORTS ADDITIONAL MEDIA ENTRY POINTS </strong></h3><p> <br/> By placing content on a variety of vehicles such as blogs, LinkedIn and Twitter, content marketing provides additional ways for journalists to contact your firm about a variety of topics.</p><p> Keep in mind SEO and content marketing strategies have changed significantly over the past 5 years and will continue to evolve significantly in the future. As the technology progresses, the opportunities to drive revenue through content marketing will likely continue to progress as well. </p><p> Are there other ways your company is using content marketing to drive leads, conversions, and ultimately revenue? We&rsquo;d love to hear how your company or brand is finding success.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Network: By Ross Levin |  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.accredited.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Accredited Investors  </a> </u></p><p> Everywhere I turn today, people are expressing concern about world affairs. Elections always create uncertainty, but combined with terrorism, changes in climate and a host of other issues, things are feeling out of control. And they are. But guess what &mdash; things are always out of control.</p><p> In the book &ldquo;The Wisdom of Insecurity,&rdquo; Alan W. Watts, writing in 1951, says: &ldquo;The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it and join the dance.&rdquo;</p><p> We can wish for the world to stand still, but the earth rotates and our lives spin with it. So rather than trying to ensure security, maybe we should immerse ourselves in change.</p><p> Some clients come in with regularly updated, detailed balance sheets. When the numbers drop, they feel bad. When they rise, they feel good. While their financial security did not change, their perception of it did. When we run retirement-planning models for clients we use thousands of iterations, some drawing on markets that none of us has experienced and use a spending rate that can survive these gyrations. Yet when clients feel poor, they tend to spend less &mdash; regardless of the permission the models give them.</p><p> Unless you are investing in silly things or doing a lot of borrowing, why fall victim to the market movements? If you have your short-term needs (three or less years) in cash, then there is no need to feel insecure. When you watch waves roll into shore you don&rsquo;t worry about drowning, so why allow market movements to make you feel broke?</p>Watts writes: &ldquo;The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing.&rdquo;<p> Thinking that reaching a number will make you secure is a false pretense. Since markets move, your assets will always be bouncing around. Becoming comfortable with your ability to embrace change paradoxically creates emotional stability. You aren&rsquo;t locked onto an impression of how the future needs to reward you.</p><p> People who are intentional with their spending feel more secure. They consider what they are spending and why they want to spend. They are realistic that most items don&rsquo;t create long-term pleasure, but also can distinguish those things or experiences they will truly value. A friend says that he often sees something that he wants, waits a couple of days, and realizes he wants it no longer.</p><p> Examine your own story to see what&rsquo;s real. You may not like a candidate, but it&rsquo;s unlikely that everything falls apart after an election. Rather than worry, plunge into it and dance. </p><p> Spend your life wisely.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  <a href=\"http://www.ironstonehq.com/author/ruthannlacey/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Ruthann P. Lacey  </a> </u></p><p> The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that by 2030 there will be approximately 71.5 million Americans over the age of 65. That number is more than twice what it was in 2000, and represents nearly 20% of the entire projected 2030 population. </p><p> Today in the US, one-third of all households are home to one or more persons 60 years old or older.</p><p> At the outset of helping a client to create a plan to age in place, the client may be extremely capable and their input will be appropriate and invaluable to you. But as time goes on the following questions become relevant when working with clients who are aging or developing disabilities.</p><h3> Do aging clients and clients that develop disabilities have good days and bad days? <br/>  </h3><li> Absolutely.  It is best to be flexible enough to arrange to work with the client on his good days.</li><li> The attitude and events occurring on days that are not so good should not be taken personally by you or your staff; don&rsquo;t hold events happening on the bad days against the client.</li><li> Don&rsquo;t force decisions on bad days. <br/>  </li><h3> Even on good days can aging clients and clients that develop disabilities have better times of day? <br/>  </h3><li> Absolutely.  Daily events in aging client&rsquo;s lives can be very much about timing and ritual.</li><li> Some clients respond better in the morning while others will be at their best midday or afternoon. Arrange a time to work with them when they are at their best.</li><li> Be thankful for good days and appreciate them for who they really are on those days when they can make good decisions. <br/>  </li><h3> Should I be aware that the unanticipated or unexpected may lead to confrontations on either day? <br/>  </h3><li> Absolutely. The meeting environment should be familiar, and feel safe and unthreatening to your aging client.</li><li> Anticipate the needs and moods of your aging client and take charge of the situation by providing for them appropriately. A general understanding of the client&rsquo;s medical condition or diagnosis can be very useful &ndash; for example &ndash; how can diabetes manifest itself medically and psychologically?</li><li> Make sure that it is the client&rsquo;s wishes you are discussing and implementing, and not the wishes of the client&rsquo;s children who are present at the appointment. <br/>  </li><p> The sheer demographics presented by older Americans needing a place to age is unprecedented. Where are all these individuals going to live? How are they going to be cared for and by whom? </p><p> The primary goal of most persons who want to age in place is to maintain a similar quality of life in the home they spent their life time creating.  What could be a more natural desire? </p><p> Yet when we look at the current economic situation in the U.S., the state of our health care system, and the available support systems, we can appreciate the need for individuals to carefully use their resources to ready themselves to age in place. </p><p> It is imperative that a good flexible plan that focuses on quality of life &mdash; including personal needs and healthcare, housing and lifestyle needs, and financial wellbeing &mdash; is created early on and maintained throughout one&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>",

    "content": "<p> A recent visit to my bank manager highlighted the need for me to open an account with a higher % interest rate. Just one catch (as far as I could see) I couldn&rsquo;t access these funds via an ATM; however if I needed to transfer money from the new account to my account attached to the ATM I could do so by downloading an App onto my cell. As explained to me, I would then be able to use this App to transfer funds from one account to another &lsquo;even while standing in line at the ATM&rsquo;.</p><p> I was somewhat skeptical to say the least and visualized lines behind me at the ATM becoming frustrated as I tried to move funds from my high interest account to my ATM account. But in reality it took no time at all; nobody was held up in a line; I transferred funds from one account to another using my cell, withdrew my cash and went on my way.</p><p> The moral of this story for financial advisers &ndash; know your clients better than they know themselves. </p><p> Bree McDonough as part of the FSC Deloitte Future Leaders Program writes in the following article titled  <u>  The Digital Revolution of Wealth Management </u> :</p><p> Evident from changes in legislation, technology and customer expectations the traditional wealth management model is not sustainable to service today and tomorrows connected customers. The Australian wealth management industry is urged to invest in building their digital intelligence and implementing a connect customer centric business model.</p><p> It is recommended that the industry implements the strategic enablers explored in this paper to increase digital intelligence and re‐engineer their businesses around today&rsquo;s connected customer:</p><p> Know your customers better than they know themselves</p><li> Redefine service and value</li><li> Plan for the future and remove barriers.</li><li> By implementing these strategic enablers, the wealth management industry can leverage the digital revolution to build sustainable and valuable relationships, build trust and a deeper customer understanding. Successful businesses will counter disruption by constantly evaluating their business model and position themselves with a strategic advantage. The longer the industry waits to leverage the digital revolution the more difficult the challenge will become, and the more ground they risk ceding to competitors.</li><li> This article raises an important issue around the need for advisers to understand their clients behaviors and how best to engage with them in a way that they are open to new ideas around managing their finances. It also presents a wider issue for consideration raised by the current digital revolution and the need for the industry to plan for meeting this challenge. <br/>  </li><p> My bank manager knows I am risk averse, time poor, reasonably IT savvy but transferring funds as described while standing in a line seemed to me a step too far. Not so as it transpired.  I took this step because I trust my adviser.</p><h3> So what are the takeaways for advisers from this scenario? <br/>  </h3><li> There is power in getting to know your clients better than they know themselves</li><li> Becoming a behaviorally smart adviser will enable you to get below the surface to the real issues much quicker</li><li> By building a framework to communicate with clients on their terms you will increase engagement</li><li> You will be able to customize the financial planning process for each client <br/>  </li><p> Make it a priority to develop deeper relationships with clients to build trust. Doing so will set the stage for introducing the kinds of change needed in the financial industry to continue to win clients and stay ahead of the competition.</p>",

    "content": "<h3> One advisor learns that there&rsquo;s more to independence than what he had in the IBD world.</h3><p> <br/> Independent broker dealers (IBDs) serve a great purpose within the marketplace. By allowing advisors to own their business, self-brand and take control of their financial destiny, IBDs are often a breath of fresh air for breakaway brokers and entrepreneurial spirits.</p><p> Further, IBDs serve as &ldquo;incubators&rdquo; for startup businesses that fall below the minimum requirements for wirehouses or are too commission oriented for the RIA space. Advisors are all the happier to share a percentage of their revenues with their broker dealer in exchange for support in compliance, operations, technology, investments and practice management.</p><p> Yet while there are MANY multi-million dollar businesses within IBDs, there are often instances where a business has outgrown this model in favor of the registered investment advisor (RIA) hybrid space.</p><p> The RIA space has undergone a rapid expansion over the last number of years as advisors exiting the brokerage space have sought greater autonomy, flexibility and control over their businesses. In an RIA model, fee-based assets are held at an institutional custodian (i.e., Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing, TD, Raymond James) and commission assets (and securities licenses) are held at a friendly broker dealer which is only compensated for the business which runs through it.</p><p> Take Will for example: A 20 year veteran of his IBD, managing over $400mm on behalf of his 600 relationships. Will began his career at his broker dealer and found great support and empowerment throughout his years at the firm. For the last few years though, as the regulatory environment has changed, tough markets have stymied organic growth and more and more of his peers left the firm, Will started to think long and hard about whether he was in the best place for the sustained health of his business. After thought and consideration, Will decided that the RIA space was the best place for him and his clients based on his 4 primary objectives that he saw as incompatible with the IBD world:</p><h3> 1. Serve as true fiduciary</h3><p> <br/> By definition, advisors sitting under a broker dealer operate in accordance with the suitability standard as opposed to the fiduciary standard in RIA space. While most IBD advisors already act in the fiduciary mindset, a true fiduciary separates product manufacturing, advice and safe asset custody&mdash;three mandates that can only be satisfied as an RIA.</p><h3> 2. Customize Infrastructure</h3><p> <br/> IBDs provide technology, compliance support, operations and many other value-add services. They do so, however, for hundreds or thousands of advisors, making customization and evolution quite difficult. Many are perfectly happy paying a few bps for a &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo; environment, but those who value the ultimate freedom, flexibility and control may find the RIA space to be a better fit. For example, Will wanted to implement the latest versions of Salesforce, E-money and ORION; however, these systems were incompatible with his BD&rsquo;s proprietary technology stack. Additionally, although Will ran a clean and compliant business, he had to follow policies meant to corral a few bad apples. Like Will, many advisors look to the RIA space to build a custom compliance organization (with a dedicated or outsourced CCO) that best suits their business. For some, optionality and compliance control isn&rsquo;t a plus, though, because it requires a lot of effort and responsibility.</p><h3> 3. Recruit and acquire </h3><p> <br/> Quite possibly the greatest benefit of being independent is the ability to recruit and acquire advisors or practices based on the premise of operating leverage. As fixed costs stay relatively stable, each incremental dollar of cash flow hits the bottom-line. While there were thousands of targets within Will&rsquo;s IBD, there was intense competition from larger and well capitalized OSJs and independent businesses. Additionally, Will&rsquo;s efforts to attract top advisors from other IBDs, wirehouses and RIAs came up short as this would require prospects to change their BD affiliation or move back into IBD land from the RIA space&mdash;a generally unattractive proposition. As an RIA, however, the pool of recruits and M&amp;A targets instantly grows to include all IBDs, existing RIAs and captive firm advisors.</p><h3> 4. Maximize enterprise value</h3><p> <br/> By leveraging an existing infrastructure and effectively sharing services, independent reps (especially those under an OSJ) save time, frustration and capital. This is done, however, at the expense of creating a sustainable business that can operate without the support of an IBD. While Will was in his early 40s and had no intention of selling his business, he was a savvy businessman who would one day want to take some chips off the table at a maximum enterprise valuation. Will also knew from industry colleagues that sophisticated buyers from the private equity, RIA and hybrid-RIA worlds typically looked outside an IBD thus limiting the pool of prospective buyers and suppressing market valuation. Bottom-line, when Will goes to sell his business down the line a buyer will pay more as an RIA.</p><p> While the RIA space was the best choice for Will based on his long term goals, for many, an IBD provides the perfect backdrop to grow a business and leave a legacy. Truth be told, Will wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to build the business he has today without the support and resources of his IBD. Yet it didn&rsquo;t provide him with what he needed to grow his business into the real enterprise he envisioned for the future. So the real question for independent advisors remains: Just how entrepreneurial and motivated are you to build an enterprise that will meet your goals not just for now, but for your future as well?</p>",

    "link": "financial-advice-profession-is-more-regulation-needed-for-industry-recognition",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> It has been impossible to ignore the DoL &ldquo;fiduciary rule&rdquo; news out of the U.S in recent weeks. It has been the dominant story in financial services, and clearly the jury (in the form of market participants) are still divided as to whether it is enough, or insufficient, or perhaps a complete waste of energy all round.</p><p> It has raised the question, yet again, of whether the financial services industry is close to being there yet.  Are we close to finishing regulatory change because we are close to being a profession? </p><p> I&rsquo;d suggest the answer is &ldquo;nope&hellip;not by a long shot&rdquo;.  And we never will be simply because it is not an either/or choice. There will be an industry and a profession &ndash; it is not one to the exclusion of the other.</p><p> But! Consider how far we have come in the last decade.  If we look at the investment side of the advice world for example, there is little doubt that the progress from product-focus to defined fiduciary role has been extraordinary in reality:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"531\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Investing-Financial-Services-Advisors.jpg\" width=\"1067\"/></p><p> Often within the industry we have vigorous debate about the right way forward, and whilst the debates rage there is generally a perception of an industry in conflict or lacking in vision of its place as a profession. I don&rsquo;t believe that to be true. The debate is usually about what is the right way forward&hellip;not a debate about where we are going forward to. In fact, more often than not the apparent conflict between regulators and industry is only a conflict about how we shall progress, not a conflict over the vision for the future.</p><p> At present much of the debate centres upon simply whether one is or isn&rsquo;t a fiduciary, and if not, what one has to do to get there.  When that particular debate is eventually resolved we will begin perhaps to get close to being able to address the role of the professional adviser in the wider financial services industry. The thing is, the financial advice industry is not the exclusive domain of fiduciaries.  And nor should it be.  Any regulator, or professional body, or market participant who feels that financial advice can only be delivered by a fiduciary has lost touch with consumers and what they want.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s consider the world of medicine briefly, as one where the role of the professional is clearly recognised and defined.  In fact it is virtually a protected profession, with an extraordinary (and in my view unhealthy) level of self-regulation. Let&rsquo;s call the qualified medical doctor their version of a fiduciary.</p><p> Certainly there are some things that only &ldquo;the fiduciary&rdquo; can do. Like cut you open with a scalpel. Only the professionally qualified ones can do that because there is a very high risk of you being dead if some unqualified twit who has been to two night classes was allowed to have a crack at it simply because he felt confident. That same person who is ineligible to wield the scalpel can however engage in delivering acupuncture&hellip;the level of qualification and oversight required depends on the potential for harm doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p> But&hellip;.if, as a consumer, I held the view that conventional treatments were not for me and I wanted to have alternative therapy which was not recognised by the protected and tightly defined professional group, who are they to say no? Maybe going to a naturpoath and following a herbal treatment plan will work for me, and it should be my choice to ignore conventional pharmaceutical treatment if I wish. Equally, I can elect to simply go to a high street shop and purchase some medicine for relatively easy to remedy issues &ndash; most of which I probably self-assessed using Google.</p><p> When one steps back and takes a wider view of the consumers needs and desires and expectations of a service industry, such as healthcare in this brief example, it is apparent that there is both an industry and a professional element within it.  It is also apparent that what makes the profession stand out from the industry, without either the industry or the profession causing confusion or harm to consumers is that there are clear demarkation lines between them.  Pharmacies are regulated, and only allowed to operate within certain parameters. So too are doctors.  So too are recognised alternative health providers.</p><p> So it must be with financial services. There must come a time when there is a clearly identified aspect which is reserved for qualified professional practitioners, simply because the risks are too significant for the unknowing consumer. But at the same time there should continue to be high street shops offering over the counter solutions to simple needs too, as not every problem requires comprehensive analysis and planning.  The industry needs to have the regulatory structure to cater for alternative choices for consumers, while still providing basic protection within each realm of consumer choice.</p><p> So while we debate whether establishing a suitable fiduciary standard is the finish line, the reality is the industry structure needs to evolve much further to capture and manage the plethora of alternative &ldquo;investment&rdquo; providers such as property spruikers, forex traders and the like. Tighter controls need to be figured out for the &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; solutions offered by retail outlets such as trading banks and scheme providers.</p><p> More regulation is actually needed before we will get to the point of having a recognised profession within the industry.  We still have a long way to go&hellip;.</p>",

    "link": "b2b-marketers-are-you-fully-leveraging-your-investment-in-content",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Written by: <u>  Natasha Drilon </u></p><p> &ldquo;Content is king, but distribution is queen and she wears the pants,&rdquo; or so said BuzzFeed&rsquo;s Jonathan Perelman. So what does this mean in practice for integrated marketing practitioners? The goal of creating content is toattract and acquire a target audience that eventually converts to customers or brand advocates. But in reality, many financial services brands find that they develop useful content but struggle to find an audience for it. </p><p> According to the Content Marketing Institute, 87% of Australian B2B marketers are creating more content than they did a year ago, yet only 28% find that content effective. Often the problem comes down to not having a strategic plan about how your content is distributed.</p><p> Here are some tips to help you fully leverage your investment in content for a B2B audience. </p><h3> What information does your audience want to know?</h3><p> To get started, you need to know your audience&rsquo;s pain points or aspirations. If you know your target audience well (we&rsquo;re talking personas here), you can tailor your content to meet their needs. For example, financial planners might want advice on ways to increase referrals and generate leads &ndash; how can you fulfil that need?</p><h3> Where does your audience hang out?</h3><p> Next, you need to figure out your audience&rsquo;s content consumption habits. Where do your ideal clients find their information or news and how do they interact with the content they read? Understanding your audience&rsquo;s consumption behaviours will help you to find the right distribution channels to amplify your content.</p><p> Dig into your Google Analytics data, talk to your sales team, look at client profiles to get clear on your clients&rsquo; demographics, psychographics and values to discover behavioural trends.</p><h3> Content formats suited to B2B</h3><p> Choosing the right format to suit your message is crucial and providing different content experiences will help attract and keep your audience more engaged. The Content Marketing Institute found that in-person webinars/webcasts (66%) were rated as the most effective format for B2B content marketing, followed by case studies (65%) and white papers (63%).</p><p> Don&rsquo;t forget that content can be tailored to suit the audience depending on where they are on the buyer journey, as we&rsquo;ve discussed before. Webinars/webcasts and white papers, for example, would probably lend themselves to lead generation, while case studies could be used to nurture hot leads.</p><h3> Content channels suited to B2B</h3><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve created your content, how can you choose the right channels for getting it to your audience? As a general rule, all content should first be published on your brand&rsquo;s chief publishing platform (most likely your company website or blog) and other owned channels before it is amplified elsewhere. This approach will generate traffic and, if you&rsquo;ve set up your website or owned channels for lead gen, you&rsquo;ll capture more leads and conversions.</p><p> You can confirm which channel/s your audience is using by mapping your target persona with the channel user, checking the information in your database and auditing your competitors&rsquo; comms.</p><p> The Content Marketing Institute found that the most effective B2B social media platforms to distribute content were LinkedIn (66%), Twitter (55%) and YouTube (51%), while the most effective paid advertising methods to distribute content were Search Engine Marketing (55%), promoted social media posts (48%) and content discovery tools (45%).</p><p> Always think about whether a piece of content can be published on other channels, and whether the format of your content is appropriate and useful for the channel it has been published on. For example, a slide presentation can be hosted on SlideShare and will play natively when shared via a LinkedIn post whereas the infographic in your slide presentation may work better in Twitter.</p><h3> Tools for B2B content distribution</h3><p> To help you get your content in front of your target audience, there are many free and paid tools to facilitate building an audience with the push of a button.</p><p> <u>  <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Hootsuite  </a> </u>  is an example of a social media management tool you can use to coordinate content across various social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google+. Content posts can be scheduled for publication at specific times and you may respond to posts directly.</p><p> In terms of earned media content, tools like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   PR Newswire  </a> </u>  can help with distribution of media releases to up to 200,000 media outlets and 10,000 websites. Basic distribution of your release is $129.</p><p> Lastly, for paid media content, amplification tools like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.outbrain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Outbrain  </a> </u>  are content recommendation platforms that help internet publishers increase web traffic by seeding it to relevant news websites. </p>",

    "content": "<p> When you think of your financial life, what&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind? </p><p> Chances are it&rsquo;s the amount in your 401(k) or investment accounts&mdash;as if the only way to measure your progress is whether the balance is greater than the last time you logged in.</p><p> While this exercise may feel important and meaningful, unless you&rsquo;re retiring in the next month or two, it&rsquo;s almost completely irrelevant. And even if you are, it&rsquo;s STILL pretty much meaningless.</p><p> Most people engage in their financial lives when there&rsquo;s an event to consider&mdash;tax time or a job change where you have to redo your benefits. Otherwise, avoidance is the name of the game. We get into a rut of checking on balances and pretty much sidestep the rest. But your involvement in your financial life should not be so benign&mdash;you can be active in areas that really mean something.  </p><p> Here are six areas where you can inject some movement where it is most needed.</p><h3> 1. Acknowledge what you don&rsquo;t know</h3><p> There are very few people who are experts in everything and financials are one of those areas where it&rsquo;s easier to ignore than confront that fact. Why be afraid to ask questions of those who really know? Just make sure that your experts have no hidden agenda or product to sell you. Coming to terms with what you don&rsquo;t know is freeing and it is certainly a step in the right direction.</p><h3> 2. How much do you really need in ready cash?</h3><p> The answer is simple: it depends! So if that isn&rsquo;t unsatisfying enough, consider what factors need to be considered in establishing a prudent number. Are you a one or two earner household? How secure is your job&mdash;REALLY? What significant purchases do you expect in the next year (having a baby, new appliances, vacation, child starting college, a move to a new home)? This is not to mention your exposure to risk&mdash;think co-insurance and deductibles on everything from health insurance to homeowners to long-term care. Each item needs to be accounted for when you create an appropriate liquid reserve.</p><h3> 3. The tax impact of your decisions</h3><p> You can make decisions that can lower your tax bill and add more to your wealth. For example, are you taking advantage of pre-tax opportunities at work? This could range from mass transit cards to flexible spending accounts. What about donating the piles of old clothes, stacks of books or furniture sitting in the basement (or costing you storage fees) that you&rsquo;re just not using? Most importantly, be aware of changes in the tax law that will impact your bill.</p><h3> 4. Being over or under insured</h3><p>  There&rsquo;s nothing easier than renewing insurance. Just check the box and send it in. This goes for warrantees and other service contracts. But what do you REALLY need and how much risk does it take off your worrying mind? Every renewal should be an occasion to discuss, shop and decide what is really important. Insure against the big risks! As your wealth increases, your needs in certain areas should decrease since you&rsquo;ll have the capital to self-insure. Areas like disability, life and long-term care can be significant risks, depending on your specific situation.</p><h3> 5. Goal-based planning</h3><p> Funding college education, retirement or the purchase of a new home are all examples of goals-based planning. These goals require time and a pathway to succeed&mdash;or your chances of reaching the desired outcomes are greatly diminished. What goals do you have for yourself and your family?</p><h3> 6. Reassess &lsquo;wants&rsquo; and &lsquo;needs&rsquo;</h3><p> Somehow, as income increases so does spending. It&rsquo;s like a magic trick&mdash;how did THAT happen? But it&rsquo;s human nature as you feel more financial comfort to devote less time restricting spending. And suddenly items that would not be on the radar become a need. Have a thorough and honest conversation about spending creep and whether the value you receive for those outbound dollars is in alignment with your values.</p><p> Your financial success is more about focusing your actions on things that make a difference&mdash;not on checking your monthly 401(k) balance. Take your time and add one action at a time; you&rsquo;ll see that you can make a visible impact on your financial success.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Investors&rsquo; use of ETFs has significantly evolved since the product first launched in the early 1990s. Yet, despite that growing popularity, many investors &ndash; regardless of their level of sophistication &ndash; do not have a thorough understanding of the total cost of ownership of ETFs. The constant evolution of competing product strategies across the last few years has only added complexity to the issue.</p><p> We&rsquo;ve prepared this paper to help advisors and investors better examine all of the costs that impact the ETF investing experience &ndash; advisors may want to share this paper with their clients. Our objective is to assist investors by explaining the differences between explicit, implicit and opportunity costs; highlighting how these costs interact with one another in practice; and demonstrating ways to evaluate different costs when selecting an ETF product.</p><h3> <strong>  THE EVOLUTION OF ETF USE </strong></h3><p> <br/> Early ETF adopters were institutional investors who saw the benefits of tax efficiency and intraday trading. Initially, ETFs were used to address short-term needs, such as asset transition management or &ldquo;parking&rdquo; a large but temporary amount of cash (cash equitization). Consequently, ETFs often only served as trading vehicles with the potential to provide investors with liquidity and low costs during periods of active trading.</p><p> As passive management gained in popularity, however, strategic investors who wanted tax efficiency and flexible trading attributes in their long-term investments began to adopt a variety of broad, market-weighted ETFs as core portfolio holdings. While the costs of holding and trading ETFs still mattered, these strategic investors also began to focus on other perceived costs that could potentially create performance drag over time &mdash; costs such as asset turnover, capital gains and how closely the fund tracked to its underlying index.</p><p> More recently, the emergence of nontraditionally weighted indices has given strategic investors greater choice and precision to tailor portfolio implementation to their specific investment views or goals. That development, too, brings with it additional costs to consider.</p><h3> <strong>  TYPES OF EXPENSES </strong></h3><p> <br/> The many different cost considerations when purchasing an ETF can be segmented into three basic categories: explicit costs, implicit costs and opportunity costs. It is important to understand that these costs are not independent of one another; sometimes lowering an explicit cost can increase implicit costs or even reduce the effectiveness of the investment strategy.  </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ETF-Expenses.png\" width=\"541\"/></p><h3> <strong>  EXPLICIT COSTS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Explicit costs are frequently highlighted in comparative articles and typically garner media attention because they are easy to find and discuss. Examples of explicit costs are expense ratio, commission and spread. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Explicit-ETF-Costs.png\" width=\"539\"/></p><h3> Expense Ratio</h3><p> <br/> Expense ratio is actually an umbrella term for the various charges assessed in administrating and managing the fund. While the ratio is often a major focus, the components that drive expense ratios get less attention. The cost of retaining management professionals and support staff is selfexplanatory, but other components are less so.</p><p> One such factor is the expense to custody the underlying securities. This fee is negotiated between the fund sponsor and the fund custodian. In general, the greater an ETF&rsquo;s number of holdings, the higher the custody fee. So a fund that holds 100 U.S. stocks should be cheaper to custody than a fund containing 3,000 stocks. Also, it is generally more expensive to custody foreign securities. So, an equity ETF focused on emerging markets that invests in American Depositary Receipts will typically be cheaper to custody than an emerging markets equity fund that owns foreign ordinary shares.</p><p> Other charges, referred to as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses or AFFE, are the pass-through costs of any underlying security that has an expense ratio. </p><p> It is important to note that for most ETFs (those older than a year); the expense ratio is a historical snapshot covering the 12 months preceding the prospectus date. Certain charges may vary from year to year and may not be indicative of the cost for future time periods.</p><h3> Trading Expenditures.</h3><p> <br/> In addition to the expense ratio, trading expenditures are a cost paid by all investors. Trading costs can be broken down into the commission paid on shares traded and the quoted spread between the selling price (bid) and the buying price (ask).</p><p> <strong>  Commission. </strong> The commission is the amount paid to the clearing firm that executes the trade on an investor&rsquo;s behalf. Commissions will depend on the brokerage firm used and will typically vary among different providers. Similar to the airline industry, the competitive marketplace in brokerage fees has constrained commissions into narrow bands based on service models. Some firms may offer incentives such as &ldquo;free&rdquo; trades or &ldquo;commission-free&rdquo; ETFs. Often these commissionfree trades have limitations with regards to trading frequency or holding period and are the result of certain business arrangements between the ETF sponsor and the broker. Also, such arrangements may result in higher implicit costs (e.g. platform or distribution fees), as discussed later.</p><p> Whether or not these inducements matter has a lot to do with an investor&rsquo;s planned holding period. For strategic long-term investors with a multi-year investment horizon, for instance, the benefit of &ldquo;free&rdquo; ETF trades can turn out to be de minimis compared to other ETF expenses.</p><p> <strong>  Spread. </strong> Since all ETFs are quoted on an exchange throughout the day, each has a bid-ask spread. Spreads vary between products because each underlying security owned by the fund also has its own bid-ask spread. The key thing to remember is that the trading liquidity and spread of an ETF will ultimately reflect the trading liquidity and spread of the securities it holds. So if the spread on the underlying securities is wide, it would make sense that the spread on the ETF would also be wide.</p><p> Spreads can be viewed in two ways: cents per share or as basis points. A basis point is a common unit of measure and is used to denote the percentage change in a financial instrument where one basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01% (0.0001). The cents-per-share metric, however, may not provide an accurate picture of the cost. For example, an ETF trading at a $10/share price with a spread of $0.01 may look competitive on a dollar-amount basis versus another ETF with a $70/share price and a spread of $0.05, but when evaluating the spread in percentage terms, the perspective is quite different. The $10 ETF is trading at a spread of 10 basis points (0.10%) while the $70 ETF is trading at a spread of 7 basis points (0.07%.) In terms of actual cost per $1 invested, the spread on the $70 ETF is cheaper.</p><p> To put explicit costs into context, let&rsquo;s look at a comparison a long-term investor will appreciate. The table below examines the FlexShares Quality Dividend ETF (QDF) versus the equal weighted average of ETF.com&rsquo;s U.S. High Dividend ETF category consisting of 14 funds. Funds designated within the prospectus offering statement as &ldquo;High Dividend Yield&rdquo; must have a portfolio construction methodology that aims to create a relatively high and stable income stream. These funds differ from &ldquo;Size&rdquo; and &ldquo;Style&rdquo; funds that select or weight by dividends in that &ldquo;High Dividend Yield&rdquo; funds need not be representative of a particular size or style basket, or of the total market. QDF is not categorized by ETF.com within this category. The expense ratios of funds in the category vary greatly. QDF&rsquo;s expense ratio comes in at slightly below the peer average while the spread associated with buying and selling QDF is five bps above the group&rsquo;s average. By combining the spread and expense ratio costs, it can be determined that owning QDF over a one-year holding period will be three bps more expensive than the average dividend ETF. Assuming constant spreads and expense ratios over a longer time frame, however, QDF will be the same or slightly less expensive than the category average over a three year or longer holding period.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"119\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ETF-Gross-Expense-Ratio.png\" width=\"544\"/></p><h3> <strong>  IMPLICIT COSTS </strong></h3><p> <br/> Unlike explicit costs that can be researched easily across many data sources, implicit costs can be harder to quantify. While implicit costs may require more effort to unearth, they are just as important as their explicit counterparts.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ETF-Implicit-Costs.png\" width=\"541\"/></p><p> <strong>  Capital Gains. </strong> One benefit of the ETF product structure is its tax efficiency versus other investment vehicles, but the level of that efficiency can vary widely among ETFs. Here&rsquo;s why: Through the creation-redemption process an ETF can look to remove low-cost basis shares using the in-kind redemption mechanism &ndash; exchanging ETF shares for a basket of securities rather than cash, thereby avoiding selling securities to raise cash to meet redemptions and simultaneously preventing capital gains distributions.</p><p> Because certain types of securities only transact in cash, however, not every ETF can take advantage of the in-kind feature. The loss of the tax efficiency of in-kind redemptions is an implicit cost. The number of securities held by an ETF also can have a big impact on its tax consequences. Assuming all else is equal, a fund that has more securities will likely have a better chance of mitigating any capital gains, but at the same time it could potentially raise explicit costs (custody costs and the expense ratio).</p><p> <strong>  Turnover. </strong> Turnover is considered by some investors to be an implicit cost. Many think the lower the turnover, the more tax efficient the fund, but this is not always the case. A fund could have low turnover and pay a capital gain distribution, or it could have high turnover and not pay a capital gain For instance, if a fund uses futures contracts or holds bonds, which have regular maturity dates, it can often be counted on to issue capital gains distributions regardless of the level of trading. Another concern with high turnover is that trading costs may be a detriment to performance. Turnover costs may weigh on the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund and could impact how well the fund tracks its underlying index. The net asset value is a fund's per-share value and is calculated by dividing the total value of all the securities in the portfolio, less any liabilities, by the number of shares outstanding. By examining a fund&rsquo;s NAV performance an investor can see how effectively the portfolio manager uses turnover to achieve the fund&rsquo;s investment strategy.</p><p> <strong>  Tracking Error. </strong> Another implicit cost of owning ETFs is tracking error. Basically, tracking error is the difference between a fund&rsquo;s NAV total return and the total return of the underlying index; however, there are actually two variations on this basic definition that investors should be aware of.</p><p> The first is how closely the fund tracks its stated index. This performance factor is a reflection of how well the portfolio manager runs the fund as well as the number and tradability of the securities contained in the stated index. Consequently, most portfolio managers attempt to live by the maxim: the closer, the better.</p><p> For example, certain asset classes, such as corporate bonds or small cap emerging equities, track their indices less closely because the securities themselves are not very liquid. In such cases, a sampling approach of owning a representative portion of the index universe may increase the ETF&rsquo;s tracking deviation &ndash; but it will simultaneously lower such explicit costs as custody fees and spreads. Examining the underlying securities in an ETF will help shape an investor&rsquo;s opinion about how closely the fund should track its stated benchmark.</p><p> Another perspective on tracking error is how closely the fund aligns with a traditional benchmark. Is the goal to track to a representative benchmark or to outperform that benchmark? This is an important consideration. Calculations such as Active Share, which measures the percentage of holdings in a fund that deviate from its benchmark, can evaluate this aspect of tracking error and help predict fund performance.</p><p> <strong>  Distribution Fees. </strong> According to the Investment Company Institute, the vast majority of all fund purchases are made through financial intermediaries, such as brokers or financial advisors. These professionals are compensated for their advice and services. Consequently, one implicit cost of ETF ownership is the result of the fund provider paying distribution fees to the platform (such as a brokerage house) through which the investor purchases the fund. In fact, distribution fees are a common way to offset those &ldquo;commission free&rdquo; trades discussed earlier. These platform fees are often overlooked and can obscure actual costs to the investor, making it very difficult to get a clear picture of the total cost of ownership.</p><p> As an example, the table below compares the implicit costs of the FlexShares QDF product to an equal-weighted average of ETF.com&rsquo;s High Dividend Yield category which contains 14 funds. Interestingly, QDF had double the turnover of this peer category but did not pay a capital gain distribution in 2014. In fact, only two funds in the category had a capital gain distribution that year. QDF&rsquo;s tracking error, measured versus its underlying index, was also lower than the peer category average. This shows that even though QDF experienced above-average turnover it did not prevent the fund from being highly tax efficient while closely tracking its underlying index.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"134\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ETF-Trading.png\" width=\"540\"/></p><h3> <strong>  OPPORTUNITY COSTS </strong></h3><p> <br/> As the ETF product landscape continues to evolve, interest in alternative index weighting methodologies has grown rapidly, particularly in the last several years. Use of these so-called &ldquo;nontraditionally weighted&rdquo; indices offers another perspective on costs: the opportunity cost &ndash; and the choice of one product over another dictates opportunity cost.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ETF-Tax-Efficiency.png\" width=\"472\"/></p><p> For example, how should investors evaluate differences in design and product innovation among competing large cap value funds? How much exposure to value does each strategy provide? Is that exposure consistently monitored through time? Does the strategy expose the investor to unintended biases, such as overweight positions in sectors, securities or countries that add idiosyncratic risk to one&rsquo;s portfolio?</p><p> A good example of innovation in product design can be seen in some of the ETFs that track indices made up of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS. While all U.S. TIPS offer the same level of protection from inflation, newer products look to help investors reduce their exposure to the risks of changes in interest rates.</p><p> A market-weighted index of TIPS provides a shorter term inflation hedge, but with significant exposure to rising market rates. To address this risk, a number of newer indices were developed that focus on TIPS securities in the 0- to 5-year maturity range; however, these indices can still experience volatility due to shifting patterns of TIPS issuance or changing rate outlooks. A more innovative approach is a targeted-duration TIPS index product such as the FlexShares iBoxx 3-Year Duration TIPS Index Fund or TDTT. This type of index manages duration exposure by reweighting a basket of TIPS securities on a monthly basis to achieve a duration target. The annual turnover on these indices is higher than their market-weighted counterparts, but they provide a more precise tool for portfolio risk budgeting applications. The targeted-duration feature may help offset higher implicit costs (more turnover in the fund) and explicit costs (a slightly higher expense ratio). </p><h3> <strong>  CONCLUSION: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER </strong></h3><p> <br/> It is vitally important to know the total cost of ownership of any investment because the total cost ultimately affects the return you receive. This is true of every type of investment &ndash; from automobiles to real estate &ndash; or even a new desktop printer. Understanding the total cost of ownership is critical to judging value.</p><p> In today&rsquo;s complex and ever-changing financial markets environment, this maxim has never been truer. As interest in ETFs has continued to grow, so has the speed of innovation in investment strategies and product design. Advisors and investors alike must make sure their education keeps pace with this market evolution.</p><p> While an ETF may look the same as its brethren on the surface, a deeper examination can reveal how very different it actually is. Decisions about which products to use or not use could have lasting impacts on the performance of an investment portfolio and ultimately impact the ability of the investment portfolio to meet an investor&rsquo;s financial objectives.</p><p> The goal for all investors should be achieving the desired investment exposure without adding unintended biases that detract value. To successfully accomplish that requires a full understanding of a product&rsquo;s features and its explicit, implicit and opportunity costs, and how they may affect the total portfolio over the planned investment horizon.</p><h3> <strong>  FOR MORE INFORMATION </strong></h3><h3> <br/> To learn more about FlexShares, contact our team at 1-855-FlexETF (1-855-353-9383) or visit us <a href=\"https://www.flexshares.com/?cmpid=iris-text-total-cost-ownership-post-40416\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</h3><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> Sometimes in marriage, one person expresses a desire for 'time' to take a break to ponder their future with their current spouse. They feel physical space will provide the mental and emotional space needed to help them decide moving forward. This can be a difficult thing to hear and accept for the 'other' party - who by and large - doesn't want to separate. There are those couples, who both agree that time and space will provide the clarity needed for both people to help them decide the fate of their future - together or apart. Taking the time needed can be helpful and doesn't always mean that the couple will permanently separate and eventually divorce. Many couples have found a way back to one another after taking some needed time.</p><p> Sometimes you have to take a few steps back to move forward in a more positive direction.</p><p> Regardless of your situation, it&rsquo;s not just a matter of packing up your bags and moving to the nearest apartment - it is much much more complicated. The three most important words in this process? <strong>  HAVE A PLAN. </strong> Without a plan - a well thought-out plan - only encourages more chaos that will be piled on top of a 'could be' disaster that's waiting to happen.</p><h3> Meet Lisa and Steve - married for 25+ years. What NOT to do...</h3><p> <br/> Lisa and Steve had been experiencing marital difficulties for a long time. They attended marital counseling in the past, but it didn't prove successful. They both continued to feel stuck and unhappy. They decided to give it another try, though Steve was more indecisive than Lisa, who continued to be 100% in the marriage. After a candid session about the issues that negatively started to erode the marriage, Steve remained uncertain about his decision. Although they had discussed separation together in an informal way, Lisa believed they were working to truly salvage the marriage. Steve was giving her messages - though mostly mixed - about his commitment to the marriage. And although he had moved out of the marital home for a brief period of time, he moved back in. This continued to give Lisa the impression they would work on their marriage. However, unbeknownst to Lisa, even as they continued to start to address their issues, she discovered that Steve had signed an apartment lease - without telling her. For one year! He said that he 'needed to find himself' and that he would be back possibly in a couple of months. Wait - what? He didn't have a conversation with her about his plans, thoughts, their two children, and the home, financial matters. Nothing. And. I. Mean. Nothing. </p><p> My disclaimer? I have to admit that no matter how long I am in practice, stories like these continue to blindside me and leave me with the deer in the headlight look - even when I know the back story and where each person comes from. </p><p> So, you can imagine that Lisa was beside herself. In order to help her figure out how to hold a conversation with Steve, we discussed several questions that should be asked to help her navigate this huge change in her life, provide some stability and clarity, allowing her to manage what will be an emotional roller coaster. These questions can help you too.</p><h3> 6 Types of Questions to Get Started:</h3><h3> <br/> 1. Finances.</h3><p> They are experiencing financial difficulties, so having two homes to pay for will ultimately make things that much more difficult. Who is paying for what bills? How will they be paid? How will we manage the ones that we currently have? How will this affect our accounts for the future? </p><h3> 2. Children.</h3><p> When will we be sitting down and talking to the children? What will you/we tell them? How will this affect their day-to-day lives? How will you ensure their safety and make sure they will be ok emotionally and mentally? When will you be seeing them? How will we communicate about this?</p><h3> 3. Relationship status.</h3><p> What will our relationship look like? Will we both be able to date? How will this impact our current issues?  How much contact will we have and what might that look like? This is very important because people who are physically separated just assume (eeekk..) that dating is now on the table. </p><h3> 4. Reconciliation Plan (or not.)</h3><p> Is there a plan for reconciliation? Will we still be working on things together, or is this a true separation? And, if a true separation, what legal direction do we need to take?</p><h3> 5. Marital home.</h3><p> Since he was leaving, what are the parameters and boundaries about coming and going within the marital home? Where will the lines be drawn? Are there boundaries? </p><h3> 6. His plan. </h3><p> Steve said he needed to 'find himself' and, although Lisa isn't really sure what this means, it is important that Steve figures that out and tell her. Without this extremely important information, she will be stuck 'waiting,' which creates inner angst and creates even more questions - that may or may not get answered.</p><p> These are not the only questions that have to be asked and answered, but by offering these as a starting point with guidance and support, Lisa feels a little better about the conversations that need to take place so that she can plan for herself and her children. A plan in these situations is mandatory. And at the very least it provides a starting point moving forward. It provides something tangible to return to, to change, to provide stability, and a level of certainty. At the very least, your marriage deserves that. </p>",

    "title": "The Link Between Leadership Training and Feedback: Reasons Why You're Program is Failing",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> For the fourth installment of our 12 month series of articles on how to create a feedback culture, we&rsquo;ll be looking at the link between leadership training and feedback. </p><p> One of the most important steps to creating a feedback culture is training leaders on how to give and receive feedback effectively. As your company&rsquo;s role models, leaders play a key role in introducing and diffusing new norms in the workplace. As such, receiving extra training on feedback can be a good way to help them overcome the fear and discomfort that can develop when people are new to open feedback environments.  </p><p> In fact, corporate training programs are a common method for companies to develop, reskill and redirect management when needed. This can be on interpersonal skills (such as giving feedback), technical skills or how to adopt new tools.</p><p> However, training programs are not enough. According to the American Society for Training and Development, US companies spend $156 billion on training programs. At the same time, they also warn that participants risk losing 90% of what they learned upon returning to the job. Are the billions of dollars spent on training each year worth it? There are three reasons why your training programs may not be working:</p><h3> 1. Hard to break old habits</h3><p> Old habits are notoriously hard to break. We all naturally come up with routine habits and ways of dealing with common tasks. Research conducted by MIT, showed that when we get used to doing a task over and over our brains fire less neurons, letting us go into a more relaxed routine mode. New behaviors, on the other hand, take more strategizing and brainpower. This explains why it can be difficult to change habits once we&rsquo;ve conditioned ourselves towards certain daily routines.</p><h3> 2. Not believing change is necessary</h3><p> A major part of breaking old habits or creating new ones is actually believing they&rsquo;re necessary. If you organize a training program to teach managers how to use a new tool to improve interdepartmental communication, but fail to explain the losses your company has suffered due to miscommunication between sales and IT, they may be less likely to actually integrate the tool into their daily habits. Communication is key. Be sure to explain thoroughly why change is needed and how it will help their job in particular. You&rsquo;ll find people will be much more active in taking steps to implement new habits on their own.</p><p> Furthermore, if leaders don&rsquo;t understand why change is necessary, they also won&rsquo;t be effective in communicating that to their employees. When any change takes place you need leaders on your side to motivate and shape this change at the team level. A study by Meliorate found that 70% of all change initiatives fail. They attributed 33% of this to management behavior that does not support the change, 39% to employee resistance to change and 28% to budget and other obstacles.</p><h3> 3. No practice/forgetting</h3><p> A major reason why training can fail is when there is no follow up to make sure managers are utilizing the skills they learned during company funded training courses. Without follow up managers may implement changes for a few weeks and then fall back into old habits. Or in other cases, they may find it difficult to transition what they&rsquo;ve learned to their actual job.</p><p> According to the American Society for Training and Development, if new skills are not practiced and reinforced soon after returning to the job, participants risk losing 90% of what they learned. Another study showed that adults only retain 10% of what they learn in the classroom, but retain two-thirds when they learn by doing.</p><p> The only way to make training stick is through continuous real time reinforcement. This is especially important when it&rsquo;s a key issue to your business, whether it&rsquo;s how to deal with customer complaints or diversity training.</p><h3> Reinforcing training with feedback</h3><p> Getting feedback and support from superiors and peers is essential to helping your managers get the most out of the training they&rsquo;ve just received. If leaders only give and receive feedback once a year it won&rsquo;t become integrated into their daily habits. Feedback on these new skills should be given both informally and during the formal review process. For example, a formal review question could include, &ldquo;how timely is this person with their feedback?&rdquo; or &ldquo;do you feel the feedback you receive from them is actionable and clear?&rdquo;</p><p> Also encourage leaders to ask for feedback on their progress from employees. Bottom up feedback is essential as employees are directly affected by new management strategies and can therefore provide helpful insights on which areas they need to improve. For example, when introducing a feedback culture in your team a manager should gather clues about the barriers that could exist. For example, &ldquo;Do you feel encouraged to voice opinions on the direction of projects?&rdquo;</p><p> Finally, remember it&rsquo;s best to work on one new skill at a time to avoid overwhelming them with information. When providing feedback training, you could consider having one short session solely on how to receive feedback and another on how to give feedback.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> According to CEOInsights.com, over 48% of inside sales companies surveyed reported that they missed their monthly revenues goals more times in a 12-month cycle than they reached them. Other sales indicators like time on the phone, closing ratios, percentage to monthly goal, etc, pipeline accuracy inevitably suffered as well as sales teams struggled to make quota and reach revenue. </p><p> In addition to missing revenue numbers, many other companies indicate that the level of training, core selling skills, and overall selling talent of their sales team could be improved as well. When asked how many companies have a defined sales process in place and a specific training program to reinforce and teach those best practices, our experience tells us that less than 35% of companies have taken the time to define and implement these processes.</p><p> While you would expect an under trained sales team to lead to under performance, what is rarely considered is the toll this takes on other factors that contribute to sales decline. Getting rejected daily and repeatedly missing sales lead to a lack of confidence which in turn leads to call reluctance. Getting beaten up for missing quotas leads to poor attitudes and these attitudes spread rapidly throughout a sales organization creating an environment that becomes toxic and self perpetuating.</p><h3> Is Sales Training Enough?</h3><p> All companies have some form of sales training, even if it just consists of new reps shadowing senior reps for a few days before they &ldquo;hit the phones.&rdquo;</p><p> While sales training can be graded from inefficient to very effective, there are some important points you should consider when designing your own sales training:</p><p> <strong>  1) Make your overall training not only specific to your product or service, but break your training down to the various parts of your sales cycle and teach best practices for each part. </strong></p><p> For example, if your first call is simply to set an appointment or send information to a prospect, what are the five benchmarks your reps need to cover for you to consider this a qualified lead?</p><p> Having this kind of clarity all the way through your sales cycle will help not only your reps but will help your manager coach them all the way through the sale.</p><p> <strong>  2) Give your reps specific, scripted responses to the sales situations they run into every day. </strong></p><p> This is the best way to empower your reps and it helps them successfully navigate the sale from beginning (getting through the gatekeeper) through to the end (getting the deal in the door).</p><p> An example would be to script out and teach them how to overcome the smokescreen objection of, &ldquo;I have to show this to my boss&rdquo; objection. Most sales reps don&rsquo;t know how to deal with this objection so their usual response is something along the lines of, &ldquo;OK, when should I get back with you?&rdquo;</p><p> This simply leads to non-qualified leads that clog up pipelines.</p><p> A specific, scripted approach to this objection will teach your reps to isolate this objection to see if it&rsquo;s a smokescreen or a real objection. Have them use something like this: &ldquo;I understand and I think you should speak to _________. Just out of curiosity, if they say to do whatever you think is best, where are you leaning in regards to using this?&rdquo;</p><p> Again, giving your reps specific tools to navigate through the sale is what is going to help them become successful.</p><p> <strong>  3) Make sales training a daily event. </strong></p><p> To learn a new skill of any kind you need to reinforce it daily. We recommend running a brief sales meeting every morning to reinforce the skills and techniques that your top 20% are using successfully. Playing recordings, role playing, passing out updated scripts are all things that will help your team improve on a daily, weekly basis.</p><h3> Specific Sales Solutions</h3><p> In alignment with the suggestions above, here are three specific sales solutions that you can adapt and implement to immediately make your inside sales team more effective. These are proven skills that will help your team navigate past some of the common objections, brush offs and situations they encounter on a daily basis. You can use these techniques as sales meeting topics and have your team help to customize them to fit their selling situations.</p><h3> Qualifying Techniques</h3><p> <strong>  #1 &ndash; Question the Red Flags </strong></p><p> One of the best ways to determine who actually does make it into your sales pipeline is to make sure you avoid one of the biggest mistakes 80% of salespeople make when qualifying. And that is to overlook or not react to obvious Red Flags prospects give during the initial qualifying call.</p><p> In their haste or desperation to &ldquo;generate a lead&rdquo; or to &ldquo;fill their pipeline,&rdquo; many sales reps will hope that any possible objection they hear on the front end will miraculously go away once the prospect sees their information or product or service, etc.</p><p> But you all know from experience &mdash; it never does.</p><p> In fact, the rule for calling back leads is that:</p><p> Leads Never Get Better!</p><p> What appears to be an objection or deal killer on the front end, always is.</p><p> A sales rep told me about a prospect who wasn&rsquo;t calling him back, and who (once he did reach him) told him that he was leaving the company. He wrote to me and said, &ldquo;I guess intuitively I knew he wasn&rsquo;t the right guy to make the decision anyway.&rdquo;</p><p> And I&rsquo;ll bet he intuitively knew this because he heard (but didn&rsquo;t question) the Red Flags the prospect raised during the qualification call.</p><p> You can&rsquo;t ignore these Red Flags! Do what the Top 20% do: As soon as you hear something that triggers your intuition or that gives you that sick feeling in your gut, stop and ask the tough qualifying questions!</p><p> Here are some examples you can begin using today:</p><p> If someone says that they usually buy from ________, but would like to see your information, ask:</p><p> &ldquo;Why would you switch vendors?&rdquo; Or</p><p> &ldquo;How many other companies have you looked at in the last six months?&rdquo;</p><p> And then: &ldquo;And how many did you go with?&rdquo;</p><p> If someone says that they will pass your information on to ________, say:</p><p> &ldquo;Thanks. So that I make sure I&rsquo;m not wasting her time it&rsquo;s best that I speak with her for just a few minutes. Can you please tell her that (your name) is holding please?&rdquo; (If you&rsquo;re then told they are not available, make sure and get their direct line or that person&rsquo;s extension and keep calling until she picks up.</p><p> If someone says that they&rsquo;d be glad to look it over, ask:</p><p> &ldquo;Great, after you do, and if you think that it can help you (or your business, etc.), what would the next steps be?&rdquo;</p><p> And so on.</p><p> <strong>  #2 Teach your reps how to avoid getting brushed off </strong></p><p> So many times prospects aren&rsquo;t really interested, but they either don&rsquo;t know how or won&rsquo;t come out and tell us. Instead they will say things like, &ldquo;Go ahead and send me the (information, brochure, demo) and I&rsquo;ll take a look.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Put that quote in writing and send it to me.&rdquo;</p><p> When a top closer hears this, his/her first thought is, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the time to do that, and I especially don&rsquo;t have the time to follow up with an unqualified lead.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s how they handle it and how your reps should, too:</p><p> Put off #1: &ldquo;Go ahead and send me your information.&rdquo;</p><p> Your response: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to, and if you like what you see is this something you would move on in the next couple of weeks?&rdquo;</p><p> OR,</p><p> &ldquo;Before I do, I want to make sure you&rsquo;d be ready to act on it if you like it. Let me ask you&hellip;(qualifying questions on budget, decision-making process, etc should be asked next)&rdquo;</p><p> OR,</p><p> &ldquo;Sure, and after you review it, how soon would you make a decision on it?&rdquo;</p><p> OR,</p><p> &ldquo;And what would you need to see to say yes to it?&rdquo;</p><p> Put off No. 2: &ldquo;Put that quote in writing and send it to me.&rdquo;</p><p> Your response: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be happy to, and from what we&rsquo;ve just discussed, does it sound like you&rsquo;d go with it?&rdquo;</p><p> OR,</p><p> &ldquo;Absolutely. How does this compare with the other quotes you&rsquo;ve received so far?&rdquo;</p><p> OR,</p><p> &ldquo;Great. Based on the quote/price I just gave you does this sound like it fits within your budget?&rdquo;</p><p> Closing Technique</p><p> <strong>  #3 Five Ways to Stop Talking Past the Close </strong></p><p> Have you ever caught your reps doing this? They deliver a great presentation, think that your prospect is with them, but then they just keep on pitching.</p><p> Or, they get an objection, answer it, but then again, they just keep pitching &mdash; or worse &mdash; they go to the next rebuttal and start reading that pitch.</p><p> Talking past the close is much more common than repeatedly asking for the sale (which is what they should be doing). And why is that? It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s scary to ask for the deal and be told no. It&rsquo;s much easier to keep pitching, &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll just cave and finally hear something they want and buy.&rdquo;</p><p> Sound familiar? It should. That&rsquo;s how 80% of your sales reps are pitching. They are ad-libbing, talking past the close, and even introducing new objections. What a mess!</p><p> Here are five ways to stop talking past the close, so your reps can spend more time closing, and earning the income the Top 20% do:</p><p> <strong>  1) Record yourself </strong></p><p> Before you can stop talking past the close, you first must begin hearing and catching yourself doing it. One day of recording your reps and you&rsquo;ll become immediately aware of when and how they do it.</p><p> <strong>  2) Use a script </strong></p><p> One of the best parts of a well-crafted script is that it ends with your reps asking for the deal! Listen to their recordings and then craft a good response to the common objections they are getting. Then, make sure they adhere to the script.</p><p> <strong>  3) Ask for the deal five times </strong></p><p> If you give your reps a close quota of asking for the deal at least five times, then they are going to be much quicker in asking for it.</p><p> Have them keep track of this on a piece of paper using stick figures. If 20 minutes has gone by and they don&rsquo;t have any marks on the paper, then you know your team is in trouble!</p><p> <strong>  4) Welcome getting a no </strong></p><p> So many sales reps are afraid of no&rsquo;s, but you don&rsquo;t have to be. With most sales you&rsquo;ve made, you&rsquo;ve probably heard some no&rsquo;s along the way, so reframe the way your team thinks about them and realize the truth &mdash; each no gets you closer to a yes. So welcome getting a no. It usually means you&rsquo;re that much closer to getting the sale.</p><p> <strong>  5) Shut up and listen </strong></p><p> Teach your team to be quiet after they ask for the sale. Use your mute button or cover the mouthpiece and count to five &ndash; 1/1000, 2/2000, etc. By forcing your reps to remain silent for five seconds after asking for the sale, they&rsquo;ll actually have something to concentrate on rather than fear.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> If your sales team is in the 50% of teams that aren&rsquo;t making their monthly sales quotas regularly, then daily, specific sales training is your fastest way of changing that. There are other factors as well, including having a Defined Sales Process, an organized sales training program that reinforces your best practices, etc. But using and reinforcing the three techniques above will bring you and your team immediate results.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Modern marketers understand full well that they need a successful content marketing strategy for online lead generation. </p><p> In the days before there were millions of blogs on the internet, it may have been enough simply to have a blog and update it regularly. Today, at least 40 percent of businesses have their own blog. Beyond that, there are many more mediums to choose from &mdash; not just video, but live video, not to mention multiple photography-heavy sites like Pinterest and Instagram.</p><p> To put it bluntly: in this competitive environment, it&rsquo;s not enough to create great content; you have to know how to promote that content as well. Here are a few strategies our consultants may recommend for you, depending on your business goals, industry and target market.</p><h3> Influencer Marketing</h3><p> The nineties&rsquo; term for influencer marketing was &ldquo;cross-promotional marketing,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s all the same. The basic idea is that two entities trade exposure to their contact lists for mutual benefit. For instance, a sports drink maker and sports apparel company may be reaching out to the same demographic, but have different contact lists. Celebrities have long endorsed products in exchange for money, free goods, publicity, or status. These days, the definition of &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; varies widely, but it&rsquo;s estimated that 3 percent of participants in an online conversation drives 90 percent of a campaign&rsquo;s overall impact. </p><h3> Digital Advertising</h3><p> Would Google make $44.46 billion on search ads if they didn&rsquo;t work? Google Search Console or HitTail will help you determine which keywords people are using to find your website. You can then incorporate these words into a paid search campaign and use AdWords to figure out the best bid based on traffic volume per keyword. Once you set up your campaigns, internet users who enter one of your defined keywords into Google will see one of your ads at the top of the page. If that person clicks on the ad, you pay the prearranged bid amount. It&rsquo;s not the easiest strategy, particularly for startups and rookies, but it can be a great way to build trust and a relatively cost-effective method of achieving prime real estate on SERPs.</p><h3> Social Media Ad Targeting</h3><p> Not to be outdone, social networks like Facebook and Twitter are in on the paid advertising trend. These two social media sites, in particular, are believed to account for more than a third of total digital display ad spending by next year. It makes sense, given the popularity of social media channels for link sharing purposes and word of mouth advertising. We recommend using Facebook&rsquo;s Custom Audience feature to narrow down your target market for your advertising to lower your cost-per-click by 14 percent and cost-per-conversion by 64 percent. It&rsquo;s also worth your while to use their Lookalike Audience feature to tap a list of in-network users similar to your existing customer list.</p><h3> Ad Retargeting</h3><p> Last year, our list of &ldquo;Top 5 Digital Marketing Trends &amp; Tactics&rdquo; included ad retargeting &mdash; which uses browser cookies to track website visitors and redirect them back to you once they&rsquo;ve gone. The Online Marketing Institute believes the average person needs between 7 and 13 ad impressions before they make a purchase. Furthermore, only 2 percent of web traffic buys on their first visit, so strategically reaching out to people who have expressed some interest in your site in the past is a winning game plan.</p><h3> Syndication</h3><p> Syndication isn&rsquo;t always easy, but you could win big by getting your content in front of thousands of visitors to high-traffic publications like The Huffington Post, Business Insider and Entrepreneur. In addition to signing up for a premium press release wire service like PRWeb, you can also use platforms like Outbrain or Taboola to push your content via pay-per-click models. Check out this MOZ post to learn more about ROI from content distribution networks.</p><h3> Call-To-Action Buttons</h3><p> <u>  <a href=\"http://snip.ly/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Snip.ly  </a> </u>  lets you attach a call-to-action button to every link you share on social media. How cool is that? It&rsquo;s super easy to get started. Simply login, find a popular piece of content related to your industry, copy the URL into Snip.ly, hit &ldquo;snip&rdquo;, choose the &ldquo;button&rdquo; action type, enter your social media message, customize the button text, enter the destination URL (your website), and hit &ldquo;create.&rdquo; Snip.ly will give you a custom URL to use on your social media posts. Whenever people click your Snip.ly link, they&rsquo;ll see your message and call-to-action. When they click &ldquo;read more,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll be taken to your website. As an added bonus, you&rsquo;ll gain access to analytics data on these interactions.</p><h3> Weekly Round-Ups</h3><p> As fellow marketer Robbie Richards points out, weekly link roundups &ldquo;might be one of the most underrated content promotion strategies on the planet.&rdquo; This strategy requires you to find roundups with a large readership and tons of social media engagement that will promote your content as some of the week&rsquo;s best in your particular niche. You may have noticed some of your content get re-tweeted this way, but there are methods of soliciting more of this promotion as well. Check out the Quick Sprout Blog for more guidance on tapping the power of the weekly roundup.</p><h3> Repurposing Content</h3><p> Not everyone has the time or desire to digest thousands of words in text format like you, dear reader. Repurposing existing content into alternate formats can help you extend your reach to different audiences, without expending too much additional effort. Video, PDFs, podcasts, infographics, and slideshow presentations all have their own unique promotional channels you can tap. For instance:</p><li> &ndash; Share your videos to to all the major sites from YouTube to Vimeo and beyond.</li><li> &ndash; Share your PDFs at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Scribd  </a> </u> .</li><li> &ndash; Share your podcasts at  <u>  <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Sound Cloud  </a> </u> , and  <u>  <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/podcasts/id26?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   iTunes  </a> </u> .</li><li> &ndash; Share your infographics at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.visual.ly/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Visual.ly  </a> </u> ,  <u>  <a href=\"http://infographicjournal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Infographic Journal  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Flickr  </a> </u> .</li><li> &ndash; Share your slides at  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   SlideShare  </a> </u> .</li>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When I co-founded my first company, we agonized over our first big decision: our name.</p><p> After a couple of interminable sessions covering the walls of a Chicago conference room with color-coded sticky notes, we finally emerged with an idea that eventually turned into our name: Qwest Consultants.</p><p> This was in 1994&mdash;well before Philip Anschutz coined the term for the now defunct Qwest Communications. (I&rsquo;ll never forget the letter from their trademark attorneys, but that&rsquo;s another story).</p><p> Our choice turned out to be perfect in the end&mdash;and not because a big-name entrepreneur made hay with it. Nope. Our claim to fame was the &ldquo;Q&rdquo;. No one else in the industry&mdash;anywhere&mdash;had a &ldquo;Q&rdquo; business. That plus our unique concept (flexibly scheduled MBA moms/dads) made us easy to find and hard to forget.</p><p> And it translated into cash when years later we sold the business to Arthur Andersen.</p><p> Now as any big corporate naming specialist will tell you, there&rsquo;s an art and science to choosing the right name.</p><p> But let&rsquo;s just stipulate you don&rsquo;t have a half million bucks to hire them&mdash;how do you as a solo or small firm leader do this on your own?</p><p> Start with this: resist the urge to choose the first name that pops into your head. Because this is a big decision. It deserves every bit as much thought and soak time as you put into building out your services and products.</p><p> Your next step is to clearly articulate your plan and vision for your business/service/product. Who will you serve&mdash;and how? If it&rsquo;s a product, than what exactly are you delivering and how?</p><p> What are you already known for? How will you position yourself in your market&mdash;and who else is in that space? And&mdash;perhaps the very last thought that may be on your mind&mdash;what&rsquo;s your exit strategy?</p><p> Because you want to begin with the end in mind.</p><p> If your goal is to create a business beyond yourself&mdash;one that will grow with employees and partners and ultimately be sellable&mdash;the last thing you want is your name on the door. Your ego may feel better, but you&rsquo;ll constantly run up against limitations. Clients want to talk only to the name on the door. High-performing, partner-minded employees want ownership beyond your name. Buyers discount firms that are owner-centric.</p><p> The exception? A business that will produce profits based on a single rock-star (or future rock-star) persona or point of view&mdash;one where selling the business isn&rsquo;t the point. The value is instead in ongoing revenue emanating from a deep point of view and/or a &ldquo;personality&rdquo;. Think Marshall Goldsmith, Dan Pink, The Heath Brothers, Marie Forleo, Tony Robbins and Suze Ormond. And toss in a few internet sensations.</p><p> Using your name is an excellent choice when it&rsquo;s primarily you delivering the goods and you plan to keep it that way: authors, coaches, consultants and solo financial advisors.</p><p> What if you have partners? Well then, in time-honored lawyerly and big-firm consulting tradition, you can use multiple names in your masthead. But beware if you&rsquo;re not a lawyer or a financial advisor&mdash;you run the risk of appearing overly stuffy, unless you can tell an engaging story about your name. Warby Parker anyone?</p><p> But maybe you want to get more creative.</p><p> If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll develop a memorable, one-of-a-kind name that&rsquo;s worth branding. One that has some zing, the right mouth-feel and that perfectly captures the right essence.</p><p> Of your business, your service, your digital product.</p><p> Now we&rsquo;re not talking about taking an un-special, common word and adding &ldquo;coaching&rdquo; or &ldquo;consulting&rdquo; or &ldquo;advisors&rdquo; to it. No renaissance or champion or peak/pinnacle anything. Please don&rsquo;t go there.</p><p> For this to work, you need an exquisitely fine-tuned understanding of your world: your vision, your desired positioning, your best clients and buyers and the most engaging and valued parts of your delivery.</p><p> Got it? An on-line deep-dive is next (although if you&rsquo;re still wrestling with an aspect of your vision, this can help you nail it down). Go to tens, even hundreds of websites of leaders in and outside your industry to get smart on who&rsquo;s out there, what they&rsquo;re selling and how. See which ones feel like they&rsquo;re in your  <a href=\"http://rochellemoulton.com/your-brand-neighborhood-redux/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  brand neighborhood </a>  and start making a shortlist of the ones that inspire you.</p><p> And while you can&rsquo;t&mdash;and won&rsquo;t&mdash;lift the work of others, you CAN use them to inspire you to create your own white space. Word to the wise: google anything you come up with to understand whether and how it&rsquo;s been used before. Is it trademarkable (not always a deal-breaker) or just too close to someone else&rsquo;s IP for real distinction? Can you get the right URL or do you need to move on?</p><p> If you&rsquo;re doing this alone (and yes, it&rsquo;s better to have a sounding board provided it&rsquo;s the RIGHT sounding board), you&rsquo;ll need to allow time for your research and ideas to rattle around. They may not resonate until you speak them out loud and give them a test drive.</p><p> Write them out, play with alternatives. When you believe you&rsquo;ve narrowed it down, sleep on it, shower on it, walk the dog on it.</p><p> But like any creative endeavor, beware of whom you share it with and when&mdash;just because your old boss or key client is supportive doesn&rsquo;t mean they have the vision to choose the right name for YOUR business.</p><p> Caveat: when you have sweet-spot clients who you&rsquo;d replicate 100 times over, listen carefully to their reactions and reasoning, especially when it comes to naming products and services. There may well be gold there and you want to pay close attention.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve named more than a few handfuls of consulting and advisory firms, practices and products and so I say this with experience&mdash;and love: do NOT create a committee of your spouse and pals to pass judgment on your choice.</p><p> Keep it lean&mdash;a few reviewers are often sufficient unless you&rsquo;re undertaking a major re-naming of an existing business. Choose those with some real-life marketing, business, and creative creds. Take their advice into consideration yes, but remember the final decision is yours.</p><p> You must stand up for your vision.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why they call you a leader.</p>",

How do you handle it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most advisers try to calm clients by &ldquo;talking them down,&rdquo; logically explaining the reasons why they should not be angry, or at least not angry at them. In some cases, this seems to work. Yet once clients hang up the phone, they are just as likely to mutter, &ldquo;Yeah, that&#39;s what they all say.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can more effectively address these strong emotions when you realize that your clients are angry because they are grieving. They feel they are losing something very important to them. Their attachment to their money is deep and complex because of what that money represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, money can represent security, success, self-worth and identity. When money gets taken from them against their will, they are thrown into grief over their many and varied losses, and anger is a normal response to that grief. In addition, people often use anger as a cover emotion for a host of other feelings like fear, and they naturally search for someone to yell at or to blame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trick is to allow clients to yell and vent their emotions to you without becoming the person they blame for the loss. In simplified terms, you need to recognize, name and allow their emotions, taking everything they have to dish out. Then, when their anger is spent, you can more calmly talk with them about how you will handle things together. So how do you do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, take a deep breath. Keep your voice measured and even. One useful tool is to make yourself smile. When you smile, your voice is automatically more calming, and it is easier to keep your own emotions in check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, to validate your clients and encourage them to talk it out, you can say things like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;I can see that you feel very angry about this, and I can see why. Tell me more.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;Yes, it is scary not knowing when the slide will stop. What are you most worried about?&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;You&#39;re absolutely right. We&#39;re all vulnerable and at the mercy of the markets right now. Everyone I talk with is upset and anxious. Have you found anyone who isn&#39;t?&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice how each of these phrases authenticates emotions your client is feeling, and then invites them further into a conversation of partnership rather than conflict. It lets them know you are on their side and you understand. If clients start to blame you anyway, always try to climb back into their boat. Use the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; frequently. Keep them focused on the future, rather than the past. Request their input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;Yes, it is a helpless feeling to see the markets at least temporarily take away some of the fruits of our work together.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&ldquo;We always positioned you in the best way possible to withstand volatility like this. In fact, if we had it to do over again, knowing only what we knew at the time, I think we would have done the same things. What do you think?&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Continue this pattern, always asking questions based on what the client is saying. You will notice the pitch of the voice lowering, longer pauses and slowed breathing as the anger gets spent and the client calms. Only then can you begin talking about what you can do together as you go forward. Ask what steps the client would like to take. Make appropriate suggestions for portfolio review, redistribution of assets, or simply keeping in contact every week or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the conversation, make sure you thank clients for being honest with you. Tell them your door is always open, and you will listen even when it is hard. Reassure them that although times are really tough right now, you can weather the storm together and come out on the other side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can master these skills, your clients will come out of even angry conversations feeling heard, supported, and most of all, loyal to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.advisorpedia.com/viewpoints/5-steps-to-take-when-a-client-comes-face-to-face-with-alzheimers\">5 Steps to Take When a Client Comes Face-To-Face With Alzheimer&#39;s</a></p>",

    "content": "<p> Many card holders in America are slammed by credit card debt and the exploding debt continues to become a colossal. And these debt stricken consumers are finding it difficult to pay off the multiple credit card debts. In this situation, it will be beneficial to enroll in a debt consolidation program to manage and pay off your debts. Therefore, if you are not aware of debt consolidation program then this article will help you understand the entire consolidation process.</p><h3> Know the basics of debt consolidation process:</h3><p> <br/> Some credit cards have high interest rate so the accruing interest on the principal balance makes it unaffordable for the consumers to pay off. The cardholders find it difficult to remember the due dates and minimum payments of multiple cards. If you consolidate your debt, then your high interest debts will be rolled into one single convenient low monthly payment. You can also hire the services of a debt consolidation company so that you do not forget to make your payments. The company can negotiate with the credit card companies on your behalf to lower the interest rate on the principal balance.</p><h3> What are types of debt consolidation available?</h3><p> <br/> You can take out a debt consolidation loan from the bank or credit union. It will be easier to apply for a personal loan or you can also get a secured debt consolidation loan against the equity you have in your house. But it is advisable to avoid taking out new loan when you are working on paying off your debts.</p><h3> Low interest rate:</h3><p> <br/> You can pay off your high interest debt with a low interest consolidation loan. If your credit score is high, then it will not be difficult to find a low interest rate loan to eliminate your debts. The secured loans have low interest rate as you take out a loan against collateral.</p><p> Debt consolidation can be beneficial if you wisely manage the situation. But you should avoid spending recklessly when you planning to pay off the owed amount. If you take out a consolidation loan to pay off your existing debts, then you should be cautious enough to pay off your consolidation loan immediately after you eradicate your debts. It might be difficult to come out from the vicious cycle of debt if you fail to pay back your consolidation loan. So, you need to be sincere while handling your consolidation loan in order to regain your financial independence.</p>",

    "link": "personal-finance-101-could-this-be-the-ultimate-college-course",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I recently returned from a reunion weekend with some of my college buddies. We caught up on wives, kids, work and all the other important parts of our lives.</p><p> One thing struck me about the conversations, no matter whether I was speaking with liberal arts majors or those who studied corporate finance: While we all know that E=MC2 and maybe even know a fair amount about Einstein&rsquo;s theory, most of them graduated without having a real clue about personal finance.</p><p> In other words, the financial skills we learn in school are not necessarily the ones we need in the real world &mdash; at least when it comes to our personal lives. </p><p> Personal finance is not typically part of a college curriculum. And while some of us have parents or family members who can guide us along the way, those individuals may not be financial experts, and there is a limit to the help they can provide.</p><p> From my experience, most people are interested in financial literacy but don&rsquo;t know where to go to get started. We all face similar issues, and the less familiar we are with the mechanics of approaching them, the more anxiety-provoking they become.</p><p> The younger you learn, the better off you are. When I was in the first grade, I wanted to be Alex P. Keaton, the money-savvy teenager played by Michael J. Fox on the television sitcom &ldquo;Family Ties.&rdquo; It was clear early on that I had an affinity for sound saving, investing and growing money. When I was 7, my grandmother gave me a dollar; I turned it into $5, then $50. I am thrilled by the challenge of helping people reach their financial goals at all stages of their lives.</p><p> For example, take buying that first home. Your career is on track, and becoming a homeowner seems like an appropriate goal. So with some excitement and anticipation, you decide to start looking.</p><p> Then the questions begin flooding in. How much home can I afford? How much should I be saving? When is the ideal time to buy? How does a mortgage work? Will I qualify? What&rsquo;s my credit score? Do I need insurance? How do property taxes work?</p><p> Imagine if there were a course in college (let&rsquo;s not get crazy and imagine they would teach this in high school) called Personal Finance 101. In addition to the homebuying lessons above, the curriculum could look something like this:</p><h3> Cash flow and budgeting</h3><p> Topics covered: What is a budget? How do I create one? How do I know what I can afford?</p><h3> Building credit and understanding credit cards</h3><p> Topics covered: What are the advantages and disadvantages of owning a credit card? How should I decide which one to get?</p><h3> Intro to the stock market and investing</h3><p> Topics covered: What are the differences in the various investment vehicles &mdash; exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit?</p><h3> Taxes</h3><p> Topics covered: How do I pay taxes? What do I need to pay attention to in my tax planning?</p><h3> Future workplace retirement plan options</h3><p> Topics covered: What is a 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA? When should I start saving? How much should I save?</p><p> My guess is that a course like this would be incredibly valuable to many. It&rsquo;s complicated stuff. It&rsquo;s important stuff. It&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that you actually need to know.</p><p> This is the main reason I chose to get in this line of work. Younger people have no idea where or how to start, and they have no idea where to find help. Traditional financial management institutions have investment minimums that most of us won&rsquo;t be able to meet for over a decade, if ever. These minimums can range from $250,000 to $500,000, and sometimes are higher. Even if you were fortunate enough to be accepted by a big institutional investment manager, you&rsquo;re kidding yourself if you think a large institution is going to take the time to explain to you the difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.</p><p> That&rsquo;s why I chose to create a wealth management model where we would provide the same customized service to all of our clients, without consideration of a minimum initial investment and irrespective of the size of their accounts. We hope that by investing in you early, you&rsquo;ll see our value for the long term.</p><p> If you are reading this and can relate to some of these thoughts, know that it&rsquo;s not just you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you majored in art or corporate finance, you almost certainly did not take a class in Personal Finance 101. The good news is, you don&rsquo;t have to go at it alone. Seek the help that is out there, and learn what you may have missed in college.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> We all know this. We are constantly reminded that to get the job done, to give a good presentation, to really get your message across we need to be great at storytelling. A great story makes your listener feel like they&rsquo;re there with you.  A great story makes the listener draw a picture in their mind. A picture that works for them. </p><h3> How to Tell a Great Story</h3><p> <br/> I train my clients to tell great stories and to have an arsenal of anecdotes.  There are so many reasons for this.  Not the least of which is that it causes people to open up to you. Sounds counter-intuitive, right? It&rsquo;s not. When you tell great (short) stories you compel people to tell a related story. This is part of being a great leader.</p><p> When you meet someone for the first time would you rather them ask you a bunch of mundane, hackneyed questions (like, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;, etc.) or entertain you with a fun, relatable story? Instant relationship developer right there! That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about, right? Developing strong, successful relationships in your professional and personal lives.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s how I do it:</p><h3> Design your story</h3><p> <br/> Take notes throughout your life of stories that are relevant to your message. Or just to things that make you have an emotion. Anecdotal stories are awesome but not necessary.</p><p> Whether they&rsquo;re able to take notes or not, I ask my clients to record themselves rambling on about their topic.  I really mean it. I want your first story to be a terrible representation of your message. Just like when you&rsquo;re in college &amp; you know you have a paper due in 3 months but you don&rsquo;t work on it until the day before it&rsquo;s due. My advice to you is to shoot for a C paper. Write your C paper in September. Then sit down again in October and make it a B. By November you&rsquo;ve got an A+.</p><p> Then we listen to the recording and we pull out all the important elements of the story.  We organize them in the most effective way. You start with something that&rsquo;s going to tie-in to the ending. To draw people in.</p><h3> Focus on the ending</h3><p> <br/> Make sure your ending packs a punch. Don&rsquo;t be compelled to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my story.&rdquo; or &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.&rdquo; Make sure you&rsquo;ve weaved in your call-to-action.</p><h3> Stories Should be Short &amp; Concise</h3><p> <br/> DO NOT USE TOO MANY DETAILS! Much of what I&rsquo;ve read out there recommends lots of details. I disagree wholeheartedly. When we listen to a story, in our mind&rsquo;s eye we see the story the way it makes us happy.  Leave in all necessary elements, but don&rsquo;t give too many details. You want your listener to be an active participant in the story &amp; letting them draw their own picture is critical.  If you&rsquo;re face-to-face it gives them the opportunity to ask the questions that are important to them.</p><p> This applies to interviews, meetings with your boss, your team, venture capitalists, small talk, everyone who needs to see things your way. In all communicative situations you should have cool stories.</p><p> Boring people to tears is never a good comunication skill to practice. Always leave your listeners wanting more from you. A good anecdote is 15-45 seconds. Stories for presentations can be a bit longer.  I like the TEDx 15 minutes. If you can pack a punch in 10 or 15 minutes you&rsquo;re doing yourself and your listeners a huge favor.</p><p>  </p>",

    "content": "<p> When I was in brand management, social media did not exist. But I can tell you this: I would have had a field day with this exciting medium because I valued the power of &lsquo;big ideas&rsquo; to infuse growth into the brands under my wing.</p><p> Frankly, I had no choice, because I&rsquo;d worked for small to medium-sized companies competing against giants the likes of Nestle, Kraft, and Procter &amp; Gamble. By any comparison, my brands were under-financed. But, they sure as hell weren&rsquo;t neglected. </p><p> Let me explain &ndash; any marketer can play the social media game and do it well with a concept that resonates. You don&rsquo;t need deep pockets. You need deep ideas. Not so fast! Deep ideas saying what? Herein lies the myth of social media marketing. It&rsquo;s not hard to come up with cute or funny stories that entertains or engages a customer or potential customer. Some people think that&rsquo;s enough to build brand franchises. It isn&rsquo;t. Ideas without strategic brand intent are superfluous.</p><h3> Undervalued Factor No. 1: Clear Brand Positioning</h3><p> Social media, just like traditional media, isn&rsquo;t the message. Yes, I said message. I know that infers &ldquo;one way&rdquo; or &ldquo;push&rdquo; communication in today&rsquo;s digital world. A message from a marketer doesn&rsquo;t have to mean that at all. But, in their haste to post and build followers, marketers overlook the importance of brand positioning. Brand positioning, to be effective, must be focused, differentiated, and single-minded. Today&rsquo;s social media marketers find that overly confining when it comes to content. Of course it&rsquo;s confining &ndash; so much so that the best strategies also tell you what not to do, inherently limiting the playing field.  </p><p> This explains why so many marketers are doing away with clear brand messaging and positioning altogether. Some say it can&rsquo;t be controlled anyway, so who cares? Disciples of brand positioning care. They stick to a very basic branding principle; people need to know what a brand stands for within a competitive set of brand options. If customers can&rsquo;t do that, they can&rsquo;t assign value to your product or service.</p><h3> Undervalued Factor No. 2: Strategic Driven Content</h3><p> Ignoring brand positioning in social media is not only misguided, it is laziness disguised by the myth that single-mindedness stifles social media opportunity. Stick to your brand positioning but search for various interesting touch points to support and further entrench that positioning with your customers. As an example, a coffee brand with a &lsquo;best beans&rsquo; positioning could be guided along an assortment of avenues in the hyper-social world. The social marketer could pursue the demanding personality of the brand to search out and secure superior coffee beans, travelogues of coffee-producing countries, idiosyncrasies of the tasters/blenders/customers, tidbits on varietals, analogies to wines, roasting, grinding, recipes, even the types of people who buy the brand.</p><p> When marketers reinstate these undervalued strategic factors into their social media journey, they can focus on the executional values that bring a brand to life in the medium. There are many ways to do this. I like the idea of telling a newsworthy story about the brand and posting consistent and continuous narratives that never stop telling that story.</p>",

    "content": "<p> We could all agree that friendships do a lot in enriching our lives. But what exact role must friendship play in the workplace? Would it be smarter to keep your professional and personal lives separate? Or would it be beneficial to find and build friendships at work?</p><h3> Pros and Cons of Friendships in the Workplace</h3><p> According to career and business experts, friendships can have a significant effect on a person's career. A friend at work may help you get a better understanding of the inner workings of your field or organization, offer feedback on your performance, and can give you guidance so you could be more effective at work. Having friends at work can also make your job more enjoyable, and may also help make you more productive and creative. </p><p> However, there is always a possibility for workplace friendships to go awry, and when this happens, it can be costly. When you socialize too much, this may impede your productivity. Also, professional or personal information may be exposed to inappropriate people. Cliques may also form, which can lead to negativity, exclusivity, and favoritism.</p><h3> Can There Be Real Friendships at Work?</h3><p> Are workplace friendships basically different from other forms of friendships? Well, yes. Your job gives you financial security, of course, and if you are made to choose between keeping a friendship and keeping your job, you are likely to choose your source of income. It is because of the positive and negative effects of forming friendships at work that you will have more at stake when thinking of whether you should or shouldn't enter a workplace friendship. In short, having the right group of friends can help you become better at your job, while being with the wrong group may get you fired.</p><h3> Making Friends with Your Boss</h3><p> Is it right for bosses and employees to become friends? Experts explain that friendships between people who are in the same level are the ones that are easier to maintain. There are many problems or issues that may arise when one friend has to evaluate or supervise the other. Also, when you try to make friends with your boss, other employees may easily question your motives. And when your boss befriends you, it's likely that your coworkers will think your boss has a favorite.</p><h3> How are you supposed to handle friendships in the workplace?</h3><p> If you ask a personal coach, you will probably be given a few tips. First, you have to be discreet about your friend's confidential information. Always be cautious when divulging information about your job or your friends. If you feel that your friendship is putting you or your friend in a difficult or compromising situation at work, you have to talk to your friend about it. Lastly, know about your company's policy about workplace friendships, and make sure you follow the rules.</p>",

    "link": "how-you-and-your-team-can-benefit-from-boots-on-the-ground-leadership",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> The Utah Jazz played their last home, regular season basketball game against the Dallas Mavericks this year. It was a must-win game for both teams. A win by the Mavericks would place them in the playoffs; a win by the Jazz would keep their playoff dreams alive. I was lucky enough to be sitting in the 2nd row behind the Mavericks. I wasn&rsquo;t lucky because I am such a big basketball fan, I was lucky because I got an unobstructed view of boots-on-the-ground leadership.</p><p> When I first took my seat, I looked up and there he was, Mark Cuban, standing right in front of me. After all the articles and books I had read, podcasts and interviews I had listened to on this successful business man, author, &ldquo;Shark Tank&rdquo; investor, philanthropist, and Dallas Mavericks owner, here he was, just feet away. I was surprised and impressed. Here was a man worth $3 billion in 2015 according to &ldquo;Forbes&rdquo;, a man with countless balls in the air at once, yet, what was Mark Cuban&rsquo;s priority on that night? There he was, in Salt Lake City, with his team.</p><p> What an incredible example of leadership. Not up-in-a-luxury-box leadership looking down on his team; but, boots-on-the-ground leadership sitting right behind his team. Watching Mark Cuban supporting his team, a team he actually owns, inspired me. That is the type of leader we need in our organizations, leaders who do not observe from a distance in their luxury suites but who join their teams, on the floor, right in the thick of things. So, how can you and your team benefit from boots-on-the-ground leadership?</p><h3> Understand needs</h3><p> When you are on the floor with your team you see their needs first hand. How do they accomplish their work? Are there resource that would help them do their jobs better? Do they work well as a team? What might help them work together better? Are they satisfied with the work they do? What would make their work more meaningful? This is the kind of information you can only get from spending time on the floor with your employees. I&rsquo;m sure that Mark Cuban has a much better understanding of the needs of his team because he has spent time on the floor with them.</p><h3> Be visible</h3><p> In order to be an effective leader, you must be visible. You can&rsquo;t lead like the wizard from Oz from behind a curtain; your team must see you, they must know you, and you must know them. Being visible shows employees that you are interested in them as individuals, that you care about what is happening on the floor, and that you don&rsquo;t place yourself on a pedestal above them. If Mark Cuban being visible on the floor with his team inspired me as an outside observer, I can only imagine what an impact his visibility has on his team.</p><h3> Understand the differences</h3><p> Every employee is different, each team operates differently, and every situation is unique. Each team member has something unique to offer, each team has a distinctive approach to achieving goals, and every situation requires an innovative solution. When you spend your time on the floor with your employees you learn to understand these differences. And, it&rsquo;s only through understanding the differences that you can learn to use them to the team&rsquo;s advantage. The Mavericks are made up of players with different skill sets, a coaching staff and trainers with differing experience, and each team they play offers a different set of challenges. Only a boots-on-the-ground leader can really learn to understand and utilized these differences to the team&rsquo;s advantage.</p><h3> Recognize the strengths</h3><p> Once you understand the different skill sets and knowledge that your team members possess you can start to see where their individual strengths lie. Then you can determine how can you help them build on their strengths. As a leader, you want the right people in the right positions. Get out on the floor, see who is strong where, and get employees working on tasks where their strengths give them a great advantage. Every player who is a member of the Mavericks team has a strength, something they excel in. By being on the floor, as a leader, you get a better perspective on who is strong where so you can play the right player in the right position.</p><h3> Build relationships</h3><p> Last, but certainly not least, boots-on-the-ground leadership builds the strong, trusting relationships that are the foundation of all successful leadership. Everyone has the need to feel safe, to feel that they belong, and to know they are part of something important. Spending time on the floor with your employees builds a sense of community, a community that you are part of. Community builds the trusting, strong relationships that you need if you are going to have the influence of a leader. I can guarantee that Mark Cuban has a much strong relationship with the members of his team because he is on the floor, in the trenches with them rather than watching them from afar.</p><h3> Show that You are Part of the Team</h3><p> Mark Cuban said, &ldquo;The key is having great players. But there are a lot of teams that have All-Stars and haven&rsquo;t been able to put it together.&rdquo; The key might be having great players but without great, boots-on-the-ground leadership great players fail to put it together.</p><p> The Mavericks ended up beating the Jazz 101-92 that night. What separates great leaders from average ones is not position or rank, it&rsquo;s all in the attitude of the leader. Boots-on-the-ground leaders show that they are part of the team. They are right there, sitting on the floor behind their team showing support; now that is how you gain powerful influence as a leader.</p><p> Get out on the floor; learn what the needs of your employees are. Be visible. Learn to understand the differences. What make each employee unique? Recognize and put the strengths of your employees to use in the positions that they are best suited for. And, build strong relationships with employees that are based on trust. I saw Mark Cuban as a great example of boots-on-the-ground leadership that night in Salt Lake City. Now it&rsquo;s your turn; get out on the floor and show that you are part of the team!</p>",

    "content": "<p> Have you ever felt the other party didn&rsquo;t understand you? Have you ever been frustrated when you couldn&rsquo;t convince someone of your brilliant idea?</p><p> If so, you&rsquo;ll be glad to know I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way there are seven essentials to make sure they never miss your point. </p><h3> First, let&rsquo;s frame the situation</h3><p> Maybe you&rsquo;re at work delivering a fabulous presentation to the Board of Directors or Steering Committee or teammates.</p><p> Maybe you&rsquo;re sitting across from a friend gabbing, but want a playmate to bring your brilliant idea to life.</p><p> Whatever the case, your listener needs to understand you and be convinced&hellip;</p><h3> Give them context</h3><p> I don&rsquo;t care what the subject is. You need to give your listener context regarding what you&rsquo;re about to share. People think and remember in compartments. They want to see the house framing before they fill it with furniture.</p><p> This is critical because once people understand the context; they won&rsquo;t continue to wonder where the story is going. The wondering tires them out! The wondering causes them to forget the other details because you&rsquo;re asking them to exert unnecessary energy.</p><h3> Tell them why it&rsquo;s important</h3><p> You have a much slimmer chance of convincing people if they need to ask why it&rsquo;s important after you&rsquo;ve shared your story. Why? Obvious benefits are easy to embrace. Hidden benefits are difficult to embrace (not to mention difficult to market to the world).</p><p> If you share the benefits at the beginning, people tend to make correlations as you lay out the details. This continually reinforces the benefits to them. Each time they do occurs, you make little &ldquo;sales&rdquo; along the way.</p><h3> There&rsquo;s gotta be a story</h3><p> People love stories because, well, people just love stories.

Consider this some positive reinforcement of what to do as well as forewarnings of what not to do.</p>",

    "content": "<p> If sales is about people, then sales is about language. </p><p> Think about it: you literally have no other means of communicating and conveying your ideas, concepts and arguments to another human being than through, well, language.</p><p> Yet, we often underestimate the true power of words &ndash; whether in the positive or negative.  And over time, some well-intentioned, often-used sales phrases have crept into the sales profession that &ndash; if you use them today &ndash; will virtually instantly kill your sale.</p><p> In many cases, the problem isn&rsquo;t the sentiment or idea that&rsquo;s conveyed. It&rsquo;s the way in which the phrase or expression is constructed.</p><p> All of the examples below are, I&rsquo;m ashamed to say, things I&rsquo;ve  personally used in the past when reaching out to prospects and clients. Especially when selling to business buyers, senior executives and high-value prospects, I would highly recommend you steer clear of these canned sales phrases.</p><p> &ldquo;How may I help you ?&rdquo;</p><p> As innocent as this first example sounds, it&rsquo;s a dead giveaway that either you are a very inexperienced salesperson, the company receptionist, or you are about to try and sell someone something. Every single call center in the world,  from Chicago to Calcutta,  uses this standard phrase as a way of greeting customers.</p><p> Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the intention behind this phrase &ndash;  after all, we should all be  positioning ourselves as helpful resources to our customers as often as possible. The problem is in the phrasing itself &ndash;  is become so commonplace, and has such a strong association to call center language that it&rsquo;s lost all its effectiveness.</p><h3> &ldquo;How are you today, (sir/ma&rsquo;am)?&rdquo;</h3><p> If I had a way of empirically measuring the first phrase coming out of the mouth of that nice young man or woman serving your burgers in your local fast food joint,  I would bet money on this one. To me, it&rsquo;s associated with nametags,  drive-through restaurants,  call centers and perhaps your local phone shop.</p><p> Again, the problem is in the word construction, specifically &laquo; today &raquo; and &laquo; sir/ma&rsquo;am &raquo;. Where there is nothing wrong with asking a prospect how they are doing,  I would caution against using this specific phrase.</p><h3> &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to touch base.&rdquo;</h3><p> Even though it&rsquo;s a commonly used expression,  I have a problem with this one for three distinct reasons.</p><p> First, it&rsquo;s essentially self-serving. You&rsquo;re offering no value whatsoever to the potential client or customer,  but instead are purely focused on pursuing your own agenda.</p><p> Second, the language itself is fluffy. What does &laquo;  touching base &raquo; even mean ? Unless you are coaching your local softball league,  it has no meaning beyond &laquo;I want to check up on my deal&raquo;.</p><p> Finally, the language is culturally biased.  Even though in many cultures (especially the US),  people are likely to understand what you mean,  you should never assume that that is always the case.  Many people are unfamiliar with customs, pastimes and sports from outside their own culture &ndash; meaning that &laquo; touching base &raquo; could be interpreted as something very different than you think it would.</p><h3> &ldquo;Would &lt;DATE&gt; or &lt;DATE&gt; work best for you ?&rdquo; </h3><p> Early on in my career, I was actually encouraged to use these types of sales phrases in cold prospecting emails. The idea was to present a prospect with a choice around when to meet, thereby somehow &laquo; forcing &raquo; them to accept one of either options.</p><p> Unless you&rsquo;re  simply trying to work out a time to meet ( and your prospect has already agreed to the meeting),  this phrase is a deal killer.  I&rsquo;ve never understood how giving someone a choice when  they have not even agreed to meet  could be a good thing. As a former buyer, if you&rsquo;d sent me an email like this, you would have just earned yourself a spot in prospecting jail. </p><p> Do yourself a favor,  and never,  ever use this tactic. It&rsquo;s sleazy, manipulative and counterproductive.</p><h3> &ldquo;Please do not hesitate to contact me.&rdquo;</h3><p> (OK, fine, I&rsquo;ll admit it.  I use this phrase sometimes.  I know I shouldn&rsquo;t,  but  sometimes it just slips in. Can&rsquo;t seem to help myself).</p><p> I get it.  You want your prospect to feel comfortable reaching out to you, lower the barriers and you want to encourage them to do so as  soon as possible.</p><p> But think about it:  don&rsquo;t you think that,  if they really wanted to reach out,  they would ?</p><p> When I read this phrase nowadays, it makes me smile.  I mean, hesitate ?  I somehow picture a prospect writing a lengthy, well-crafted email,  only to spend several minutes with their finger hovering over  the send key wondering whether or not to hit send.</p><p> When does that ever happen ?</p><h3> &ldquo;I trust you are well.&rdquo;</h3><p> Even though this is a courtesy phrase,  it&rsquo;s always sounded a little too much like an order to me.  Like I&rsquo;m supposed to be well or something. It&rsquo;s too authoritative, too sure of itself.</p><p> You have no idea of what&rsquo;s going on in your prospect&rsquo;s life, and no right to make assumptions (or &laquo; trust &raquo;) about any of it.</p>",

    "title": "How Do You Choose To Grow? Do You Even Want To Grow?",
    "link": "how-do-you-choose-to-grow-do-you-even-want-to-grow",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> <strong>  Growth seems to be the operative term in the financial advisory industry. </strong> Everyone wants growth&mdash;clients want growth in their portfolios, advisors want growth in their practices. However, growth can be a double-edged sword, especially if it comes through hasty strategies, or at the expense of client service or your wellbeing. If growth isn&rsquo;t planned for and approached in the right way, the clients will suffer and, eventually, so will the business and even your quality of life. It is imperative to have a clear strategy in place for addressing change and growth before they happen.</p><p> You don&rsquo;t always get a say in whether or when growth happens, but there is one question that you should be asking yourself well in advance: Why do you want to grow? Asking this question helps identify not only the forces that are driving you to grow, but a plan for approaching that growth in a conscious way. It is vital to be clear about your <u>  <a href=\"///C:\\Users\\kpend\\Dropbox\\ChoiceLadder%20-%20Flackable\\Content\\Growth\\choiceladder.com\\alphazone\">   motivations, personal beliefs and conditioned habits  </a> </u> , as they will steer your choices.</p><h3> The Downside of Unmanaged Growth</h3><p> <br/> Many financial advisors start off their businesses as an individual advisor. As their business grows, they bring on an assistant to help them manage the workload.  They keep adding staff as the demands of the business grow, and suddenly they realize that they have a group and end up calling them a team, purely by default.  I am not aware of any successful sports team that recruits talent using this approach. Unmanaged growth usually also ends up hurting the business. While revenues and profits can be increased in the short term, trust and loyalty are built slowly over time. That trust and loyalty can, however, be lost very quickly with poor service, eroding client loyalty and eventual retention. This creates an even bigger overarching problem: additional staff have been hired to handle the growth, but new anxieties about increased costs and reduced production have been introduced.</p><p> Similarly, focusing too much on aggressive growth targets just for the sake of growing does not usually lead to lasting positive outcomes. It is also easy to operate on autopilot when it comes to growth, going about it in a way that leads us to mindlessly put one step in front of the other. Under this method, it&rsquo;s possible to become consumed in frenzied activities, all under the pretense of growth.  Neither option is ideal.</p><h3> The Upside of Conscious Growth</h3><p> <br/> It is possible to grow your practice and your profits while at the same time enriching the lives of both your clients and your staff with a planned, systematic and strategic approach.  Transitioning from a solo entrepreneur to an effective CEO of your firm starts with a shift in mindset&mdash;your way of thinking.</p><p> I&rsquo;ve envisioned a three-level growth model for financial advisors that I believe can take their business to the next level, if they so choose to pursue.</p><p> <strong>  Level One: </strong> At this level, one individual makes all of the firm&rsquo;s decisions. This is a very popular initial approach. In 2005, there were over <u>  <a href=\"http://www.solo-e.com/solo-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   20 million solopreneur  </a> </u> businesses in the United States. People prefer this method of conducting business because they have freedom they wouldn&rsquo;t have working for someone else.</p><p> As time goes on, the entrepreneur in charge brings in more employees to help with his growing business; their day begins to be consumed by operational details as opposed to client-facing duties, which is where the founder&rsquo;s talents and interests actually lie. This causes more <a href=\"http://mindfulchoices.org/2014/03/04/to-worry-or-not-to-worry/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  strain and worry </a> on their everyday life&ndash;&ndash; that is a signal that it is time to move on to Level Two. Unfortunately, this transition can be challenging for many entrepreneurs due to both fear and control issues. This is a choice not to be approached lightly. The growth between levels is not automatic, nor is it mandatory. If your mindset as an entrepreneur shifts, the time may be approaching to choose an approach to the next level.</p><p> <strong>  Level Two: </strong> If you can evolve into this level, two people share the decision-making responsibilities and run the business together. The transition between levels one and two is the most difficult, because often the individual who was originally in charge has invested a lot of time and money in the business and is fearful of the risk of losing it all and often feels like there is a level of <a href=\"http://mindfulchoices.org/2014/02/15/smart-people-beaware-dont-micro-manage-your-life-into-dysfunction/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  control </a> he or she needs to maintain. The transition is worth it: it takes <u>  <a href=\"/category/grow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   3.6 times longer  </a> </u> for a solo entrepreneur to establish themselves than with a good partner or manager.</p><p> <strong>  Level Three: </strong> If you truly wanted to build a business that is bigger than you, this is the level entrepreneurs should aspire to reach. At this level, the business has evolved to a place where it is being managed by three or more members of an executive team. This allows for stability, both day-to-day and also when unpredictable changes occur. This can also keep the founder&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://mindfulchoices.org/2014/02/01/ego-awareness-in-mindfulness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  ego </a> from potentially hindering the business. Growth is usually most productive in this phase.</p><h3> Keeping Growth In Mind, and Your Mind On Growth</h3><p> <br/> In addition to dedicating significant effort to attracting the right talent to the firm, the organization systematically needs to align its talent acquired over time (i.e., first you have to get the right people on the bus, then you have to make sure the right people are in the right seats on the bus). Your approach to growth is a personal choice&mdash;one that can either improve your quality of life or diminish it. When you get obsessed with growth for the wrong reasons, not only have you become extremely vulnerable to the vagaries of the market and irrationality of human beings, but also willingly give up your peace of mind.</p><p> Taking on the challenge to transition from level one all the way through level three is truly a worthwhile endeavor that will generate lasting value. It will push you to switch your perspective from viewing everything as a cost to viewing it as an investment, and will bring you the security and freedom of running a firm. If, during the course of growth between levels, you find yourself unable to make the switch, it is important to reconsider or reevaluate the reasons you want to grow&mdash;or if you want to at all. Unless you are open to shifting your mindset in a way that will allow for collaboration and sharing the growing responsibilities with others in your firm, the risks of the transitions will outweigh the rewards.</p><p> Go back to the most important question: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s driving me to grow?&rdquo; Spend some time reflecting on your personal beliefs regarding success. From there, you can make the choice that best suits your business and your personal goals. This choice, once acted upon, is what will cause your life to either flourish or struggle. The system of levels I&rsquo;ve presented above offers three options for growth. Your decision will be strongly influenced by your beliefs, conditioning and drives&ndash;&ndash;the choice is yours.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Have you put the spotlight on the employee experience at your company?  <br/> <br/> I've written many times about the importance of the employee experience, both on its own with regard to retention and performance and with regard to the impact of the employee experience on the customer experience. <br/> <br/> Sadly, many companies still aren't focusing on the employee experience. IDC's 2015 EXPERIENCES Survey work found that 81% of companies listen to customers about their experiences, but 69.4% of companies do not measure the employee experience.  <br/> <br/> For those still looking for proof that this is a real thing, I've started to take note of some recent research and statistics about the impact of a great employee experience. I thought I'd start to compile them in one place and share with you, in case you're in the process of building the business case or need to nudge your company that employees matter. <br/> <br/> It's important to note that the employee experience starts well before the employee signs on the dotted line. Consider that your candidates may already know the brand through their own interactions as customers; or they may know someone who works - or has worked - for the company. <br/> <br/> So let's start there, with the employer brand. Just as your brand is important to attracting and retaining customers, your employer brand attracts potential employees and drives whether they'll want to stay. How does your employer brand impact the business? (After all, that's what executives want to know: if we focus on the employee experience, what does that mean for the business?) Dr. John Sullivan wrote a great article about 10 employer branding business impact metrics that you should track.</p><h3> Pick the ones you want to focus on, but they are listed in order, with the most powerful ones first...</h3><li> Better-performing new hires that result from your branding effort</li><li> An increase in overall workforce productivity</li><li> Increased revenue from hires in revenue-generating positions</li><li> A high employee referral rate increases productivity</li><li> A higher employee retention rate of current employees</li><li> A reduced failure rate among new hires</li><li> Your applicants come from top firms</li><li> A higher ratio of winning head-to-head recruiting competitions</li><li> A positive giveaway/takeaway ratio</li><li> Employer branding program ROI</li><p> Interesting that he places ROI at the bottom of the list because it seems like that's where everyone starts! Kevin Kruse defines the ROI or the business impact of employee engagement (which is just one component or measure of the employee experience, along with trust, happiness, satisfaction, retention, etc.) as the Engagement-Profit Chain, which looks like this.</p><h3> Engaged employees lead to...</h3><li> higher service, quality, and productivity, which leads to&hellip;</li><li> higher customer satisfaction, which leads to&hellip;</li><li> increased sales (from more repeat business and referrals), which leads to&hellip;</li><li> higher levels of profit, which leads to&hellip;</li><li> higher shareholder returns (i.e., stock price)</li><p> Those are pretty powerful outcomes for the business. I don't think anyone can argue with that. Here's a graphic that supports that last bullet point about higher shareholder returns. Watermark Consulting looked at the employee experience leaders based on Great Place to Work findings and charted their performance on the S&amp;P 500 for the last 18 years, from 1997 to 2014. Their annualized returns outperformed the stock market by nearly double.</p><p> Aon Hewitt's 2015 Trends in Global Employee Engagement tells us the following: a 5% increase in employee engagement is linked to a 3% increase in revenue growth in the subsequent year.  <br/> <br/> In their work, Dale Carnegie Training uncovered that $11 billion is lost annually due to employee turnover and that companies with engaged employees outperform those without by up to 202%. <br/> <br/> In a report published by PwC, they cited: Based on stock performance, Wharton professor Alex Edmans determined that companies on the Fortune list of &ldquo;best companies to work for&rdquo; outperformed their peers by 2&ndash;3 percent per year. <br/> <br/> In a whitepaper by Rutgers, A New Framework of Employee Engagement, they note that: a meta-analysis of the financial performance of 1,979 business units in ten companies found that business units that score above the database median on both employee and customer engagement metrics were, on average, 3.4 times more effective financially (in terms of total sales and revenue, performance to target, and year-over-year gain in sales and revenues) than units that rank in the bottom half on both measures. <br/> <br/> There's also this Sears work that I've cited a few times from a 1998 article in Harvard Business Review; it summarizes the work that Sears executives did to rebuild the company to focus on customers. The article talks about the new business model and what they discovered: \"There is a chain of cause and effect running from employee behavior to customer behavior to profits.\"   <br/> <br/> When Sears went through this transformation in the '90s, they saw some impressive results (according to the same article): <br/> <br/> Our model shows that a 5 point improvement in employee attitudes will drive a 1.3 point improvement in customer satisfaction, which in turn will drive a 0.5% improvement in revenue growth. <br/> <br/> And...  <br/> <br/> Independent surveys show that national retail customer satisfaction has fallen for several consecutive years, but in the course of the last 12 months, employee satisfaction on the Sears TPI has risen by 4%, and customer satisfaction by almost 4%. That may seem a trivial improvement. But if our model is correct&mdash;and its predictive record is extremely good&mdash;that 4% improvement in customer satisfaction translates into more than $200 million in additional revenues in the past 12 months. At our current after-tax margin and price-earnings ratio, those extra revenues increase our market capitalization by nearly one-quarter of a billion dollars. Even more impressive from our point of view is what our model tells us: it is our managers and employees who, at the moment of truth in front of the customer, have achieved this prodigious feat of value creation. <br/> <br/> I think one of the most disheartening things that I read - though I'm not surprised at all - is that 7 out of 10 companies don't even measure employee engagement or the employee experience. (But then I also question what the other 3 are doing with what they heard!) That's insane. It's really important for companies to understand the impact the employee experience has on the customer experience, on the business, on business outcomes, and more.  <br/> <br/> Just like with customer experience initiatives, employee experience initiatives and culture transformations and making your company a great place to work happens top-down. If your CEO isn't committed to the transformation, setting expectations for her managers, and being the role model for how to deliver a great employee experience, it won't happen. A couple of examples of companies with committed CEOs that come to mind include: Southwest Airlines, Zappos, Amazon, and Barry-Wehmiller. <br/> <br/> What about your company? Would you add it to this list of examples? Or is your company part of \"that statistic?\"</p>",

    "content": "<p> Life insurance may be something on your list of things you think you could cut from your budget soon after you retire. If you think of this financial product as something that only has value during your working life, you may need to take another look at it. You may find that you still need life insurance after retirement, after all.</p><p> Do you need life insurance after retirement? There are some good reasons to keep this coverage in place, even after you have stopped collecting a pay cheque. The tax-free funds can be used by your beneficiaries for any or all of the following:</p><h3> Final Expenses</h3><p> Even the simplest funeral or memorial service, including cremation or burial, will have some cost involved. How will your loved ones cover these expenses? The proceeds from the life insurance policy is extra money set aside which can be used for this purpose.</p><h3> Pay Off Debts</h3><p> Part of settling the estate includes paying off debts. This step must be completed before the beneficiaries can receive their inheritance. Funds from the life insurance policy can be used to pay off credit cards, lines of credit, a mortgage, or other debts.</p><h3> Legal Fees and Expenses</h3><p> The cost of hiring an attorney to settle the estate is another expense that your loved ones will need to deal with after your death. Funds from the insurance policy settlement are a source of ready cash that can be used for this purpose.</p><h3> Final Income Tax Return</h3><p> Your estate will need to file a final income tax return for the year of your death. Some assets may be transferred directly to a spouse. If your spouse pre-deceases you or you are leaving assets to a child or grandchild, your estate may need to pay capital gains tax on investments or real estate.</p><p> If you have registered funds that are not going directly to a spouse or financially dependent child/grandchild, a huge tax consequence may be triggered. The funds received from the life insurance policy could be used to pay this expense, leaving more money available for your beneficiaries.</p><h3> Provide Income for Your Beneficiaries</h3><p> The proceeds from the life insurance policy can be used to support your spouse after you pass away. Pension income often takes a dramatic drop after the passing of one spouse. Life insurance can help make up for the lost income.</p><p> Many older adults are in a situation where they are also helping their adult children and their grandchildren financially. If you are supporting an adult child with a disability, you may want to consider keeping coverage in place that can be used to continue that arrangement after your death. Your financial advisor can explain your options.</p><h3> Don&rsquo;t Cancel Existing Life Insurance Coverage</h3><p> Don&rsquo;t cancel an existing life insurance policy until you have discussed your plans with your financial advisor. Even if you decide you don&rsquo;t want to keep the policy in force, the decision you make can have a profound effect on your beneficiaries. A solution would be to consider asking the beneficiaries for help paying the premiums or transferring ownership of the policy to the beneficiaries outright.</p><p> The latter choice means that you would no longer have control over the insurance policy, and the beneficiaries would be able to increase or decrease the level of coverage, or cancel the policy. This is a decision that would require a lot of thought, and you would need to get expert advice before making this type of change.</p><p> Are you looking at your life insurance coverage but aren&rsquo;t sure whether the policy still fits you and your retirement lifestyle? As an experienced financial advisor, I can sit down with you to make sure that you have the right type and level of coverage for your needs.</p>",

    "title": "How to Create Happy Employees Who WILL Perform Better?",
    "link": "how-to-create-happy-employees-who-will-perform-better",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Business owners and executives increasingly understand the importance of employee engagement. This makes perfect sense because you typically associate engagement with retention and productivity.At the same time, however, many employers have yet to realize the pivotal role employee happiness plays in the workplace. More specifically, they don&rsquo;t understand that it's virtually impossible to expect employees to be engaged if they&rsquo;re not happy in the first place.Yes, there can be happy employees who are simply not engaged and therefore not productive. Think of the happy-go-lucky fellow who considers work an eight-hour block designed for socialization.But it&rsquo;s impossible for an employee to reach their full potential if they are miserable every time they step foot in the office. Think about it. You&rsquo;ve almost certainly had a job you hated at one point or another.Sure, you might have powered through and got a ton of work done &mdash; that&rsquo;s how you roll. But how much more productive would you have been in that position if you were happy? At the very least, you wouldn&rsquo;t have spent a ton of time thinking about how much you hated your job. And those hours could have been reinvested in more productive work activities.Before we dive into how, specifically, happy employees benefit companies, let&rsquo;s take a look at some employee happiness stats compiled by the folks over at SnackNation:</p><li> Companies with happy employees outperform their competitors by 20%</li><li> Happy salespeople generate 37% more sales than their depressed peers</li><li> 36% of employees would sacrifice $5,000 of salary to be happier at work</li>Now that you see the importance of employee happiness, let&rsquo;s dig a little deeper to reinforce the point.<h3> Happy Employees Are More Likely to Stick Around</h3>The importance of employee happiness extends beyond mere anecdotal evidence. According to a recent study by Growth Engineering, happy employees are not only more productive, they&rsquo;re less likely to be absent from work. They&rsquo;re also 10% more engaged and 40% more likely to be promoted.As millennials come to dominate the workforce, that last statistic is one that can&rsquo;t be overlooked. More so than simple salaries, millennial employees &mdash; who will represent 50% of the global workforce by 2020, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers &mdash; are driven by opportunities for professional growth, development, and advancement. In other words, when your employees are happy, they&rsquo;re more likely to move up the ladder, which means they&rsquo;re less likely to look for another job &mdash; particularly when they are millennials.It can cost more than $15,000 to replace an employee. For that reason alone, employee happiness should be something business owners keep top of mind.<h3> Happy Employees Perform Better Across the Board</h3>According to research cited by the Harvard Business Review, when employees approach their jobs with a positive mindset &mdash; something you&rsquo;d imagine is nearly impossible for unhappy workers &mdash; performance across the board improves. Not only are happy employees more engaged and more productive, they&rsquo;re also more creative.So in addition to companies benefitting from increased high-quality output, they also are able to tap into the brilliant minds of their employees. That creativity may very well result in new products or service offerings, new and more efficient procedures, or new collaborative processes.<h3> Happy Employees Help Sustain a Great Work Culture</h3>If you had a choice, would you rather be around someone who&rsquo;s happy or someone who&rsquo;s miserable? Unless you&rsquo;re a masochist, you&rsquo;d probably choose the former and for good reason.A 2008 study from Harvard Medical School revealed that just like the flu or the common cold, happiness can be contagious. &ldquo;Just as some diseases are contagious, we&rsquo;ve found that many emotions can pulse through social networks,&rdquo; said Nicholas Christakis, a professor at HMS.According to our Employee Engagement Report, work culture is strongly correlated with employee happiness. For our purposes, this means two things:<li> When employees fit in with their company&rsquo;s culture, they&rsquo;re more likely to be happier.</li><li> Because happiness is contagious, happier employees are more likely to rub off on one another, which in turn helps sustain the company culture that business owners have worked so hard to build.</li>On the other hand, companies filled with unhappy employees will have a tremendously difficult time maintaining their work cultures &mdash; which could result in accelerated turnover and a reduced bottom line.<h3> How to Increase Employee Happiness</h3>Now that you&rsquo;re aware of all the ways employee happiness benefits your business, here are some ideas you can implement to increase the chances your employees are smiling more often than not:<strong> Give Your Employees Free Food</strong>You may laugh and brush this one off, but according to a recent USA Today article, 67% of employees who have constant access to free food consider themselves either &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; or &ldquo;very&rdquo; happy in their current roles.You can&rsquo;t expect your employees to produce at their highest abilities on an empty stomach. Offering free food not only increases happiness and healthiness, it can also be used to attract top talent. It&rsquo;s a worthwhile investment.<strong> Invest in Team-Building Exercises</strong>A recent Gallup report contains two very interesting nuggets of information. First, when workers make friends with their coworkers, employee satisfaction is boosted by 50%. Second, employees who have a best friend at work are seven times as likely to be fully engaged. In this light, employers should do everything they can to foster these kinds of relationships. Team-building activities, which &ldquo;force&rdquo; people to interact with one another, can be used to accomplish this goal.<strong> Offer Professional Development Opportunities</strong>As discussed above, happier employees are more likely to be promoted. But it&rsquo;s not like you can promote every single one of your workers. That&rsquo;s OK. According to our Employee Engagement Report, only 25% of workers feel as though there are adequate opportunities for professional development offered by their employers. Make professional development a top priority for your organization, and your employees will be happier.Employee happiness is not the same thing as employee engagement. But employees cannot be fully engaged unless they are happy in the first place. With all this considered, it should be easier for you to sell the importance of the word &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; at your organization.",

    "content": "<p> I&rsquo;m often asked, as we move more and more to digital communications: what will happen to the people? What will happen to the people? As we move to robotics, automated agents, augmented and artificial intelligence, what will happen to the people. If we have no branches, no structures and no buildings that need humans, what will happen to the people.</p><p> It&rsquo;s a good question. It&rsquo;s a question that always crops up as we move from one form of work to another. If we have no farms, where will people work? If we have no factories, where will people work?  If we have no offices, where will people work?</p><p> Jobs change, as does life, and we have already moved from hard labour to blue collar to white collar. Where we go next is the big question. My feeling is that we move to a world of servicing technology. Technology will allow us to live our lives more easily, smarter and with greater confidence.  In return, we will nurture and generate technologies that allow us to live our lives easier, smarter and more confidently.</p><p> Unskilled workers will service robots and machines; skilled workers will create amazing services with robots and machines; and machines will gradually nurture and operate themselves. Just because a machine can manage itself however, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will never breakdown. Equally, just because a machine has artificial intelligence, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will never need real intelligence to make the next breakthrough.</p><p> So our concerns about machines and automaton are often misplaced as machines and automation often create new industries, new jobs and new opportunities. A good example is the end of the branch.  It is clear that the transactional teller jobs and branch structure is past its sell-by date.  It is a last century structure of physical distribution that is no longer needed in the age of automation. So what do we do with the branches and the humans? Branches can be sold. Many are now coffee bars and wine bars. But the humans? What will happen to the people?</p><p> Well, if the humans are any darned good, they will move to support digital interactions. If the branch staff are that good at relationship, then get them on to Facebook and Skype to create digital relationships. Surely a really empathetic, engaged and enthusiastic member of the branch workforce could share that empathy, engagement and enthusiasm just as easily through a Skype call or Facebook message?</p><p> I guess the question is more whether they have that empathy, engagement and enthusiasm in the first place, bearing in mind that most branch staff are pure administrators who are paid peanuts. So, what are the jobs of the future in banking?  Where will the people make a difference?</p><p> Andy Haldane of the Bank of England gave a great speech about the implications of robots on labour last year, and warned that automation posed a risk to almost half those employed in the UK and that a &ldquo;third machine age&rdquo; would hollow out the labour market, widening the gap between rich and poor.</p><p> A new report by Australian Government Agency CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) finds ten major forces changing the dynamics of work</p><li> Education and training is becoming ever more important</li><li> New capabilities are needed for new jobs of the future</li><li> Digital literacy is needed alongside numeracy and literacy</li><li> The changing importance of STEM (whilst participation rates are in decline)</li><li> Aptitudes and mindsets to handle a dynamic labour market</li><li> Challenging perceptions and norms about job types</li><li> Improving workforce participation in vulnerable demographics</li><li> Towards tapered retirement models</li><li> New models to forecast job transition requirements</li><li> Improved understanding of the peer-to-peer (and freelancer) economy <br/>  </li><p> Whilst the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Future of Jobs report finds enormous change predicted in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Top-10-Skills.jpg\" width=\"628\"/></p><p> In banking, we are already seeing major changes, with traders almost irrelevant in investment banking these days.  The days of multimillion dollar bonuses may be over, when a machine can invest better than a human.</p><p> According to Daniel Nadler, CEO of Kensho, a financial analytics tool, a third to a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to automation software within the next decade.</p>",

    "link": "fintech-advantage-driving-banks-towards-a-connected-ecosystem",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In a previous article, I shared some interesting findings around the state of banking customer experience across the globe from our World Retail Banking Report from Capgemini and Efma.</p><p> For a quick reminder, some of the findings I found interesting include:</p><li> Globally, positive banking customer experience levels rose from 39.5% in 2014 up to 54.7% in 2016, but younger generations still lag behind</li><li> Increases in profitable customer behavior have not followed increases in banking customer experience (e.g., Likely to stay with firm up 1.4PP to 55.1%; Likely to refer friends only up 1.0PP to 38.4%; and Likely to buy another product from primary bank up 0.6PP to 15.9%).</li><li> Likelihood customers would refer FinTech to friend (54.9%) was over 40% higher than for banks (38.4%).</li><p> It appears FinTechs have initially found some success in tapping customers&rsquo; referral mindshare. That may be partly explained by why some customers have begun to choose FinTech providers over banks. Out of the 16,000+ banking customers we interviewed across 32 countries, &lsquo;Ease of Use&rdquo; was the primary advantage they believe FinTechs have over banks.  A very close 2nd and 3rd were &lsquo;Faster Service&rsquo; and &lsquo;Good Experience&rsquo;. &lsquo;Lower Fees&rsquo; came in a close 4th.  Its clear customers are looking for simple, fast, and high quality experiences.  They&rsquo;re looking for minimal friction and they generally believe FinTechs are currently able to deliver this more effectively than banks. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Value-Proposition-of-fintech-firms.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> When we asked banks what they believe customers view as FinTech&rsquo;s value proposition vs. banks, they recognized &lsquo;East of Use&rsquo; was the top differentiator.  They also saw &lsquo;Lower Fees&rsquo; as important. </p><p> However, when asked about the value proposition FinTech&rsquo;s deliver to customers around &lsquo;Good Services/Experience&rsquo; and &lsquo;Quick Turnaround&rsquo;, they greatly underestimated the value customers place on FinTechs&rsquo; ability to deliver those better than banks.</p><p> This could explain why nearly 2/3 of customers globally already leverage a FinTech for at least one product or service.  And of those FinTech adopters, over 40% have multiple products with FinTech providers</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Banking-Customers-Usage-of-Fintech-firms.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> None-the-less, banks still feel they have some clear strengths and advantages compared to FinTech&rsquo;s. </p><p> Specifically, the top area noted by bankers was &lsquo;Customer Trust.&rsquo;  Over 70% of bank executives we interviewed saw trust as an advantage they hold over banks. &lsquo;Established Relationships&rsquo; followed close with 65.3%.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Banking-Executives-perception-of-banks-strengths-versus-fintech-firms.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> Customers did provide some support to that assertion by banks. Banks still hold a strong lead with 54.5% of customers globally having &lsquo;Complete Trust&rsquo; in their banks vs. only 30.8% feeling the same with FinTech&rsquo;s. </p><p> However, that gap is closing as trust levels are nearly identical when you add in &lsquo;somewhat Trust&rsquo; (93.7% for banks vs. 90.2% for FinTechs).</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Customers-trust-and-confidence-in-primary-bank-versus-fintech-firms.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> So what does this all mean for banks, FinTechs, and customers? I had the pleasure of Chairing the entire morning session of Day 2 at NetFinance this week in Miami and had the opportunity to moderate a couple of panels discussions where we covered this topic.  </p><p> Each discussion centered around a couple of core themes of how to meet increasing customer expectations.  <br/> <br/> First, there is certainly a lot more talk about 'Customer First.'  Leading banks have started to make this more than just a motto.  It's not just about the technology implemented, but the overall culture of the organization to focus on the customer.  </p><p> Second was around personalization and customization of the customer experience. How do you balance leveraging the data and insights you have on your customers and without crossing that line of being viewed as 'creepy.'  Also, how can deliver personalized experience as interactions continue to transition from face-to-face to digital.  Only 13% of banking customers visit their branch at weekly. Compare that to 59% engaging with the bank via internet weekly and 33.3% via mobile.  The percent of customers are interacting with their banks weekly on social media (11%) has almost reached the same number of customers visiting the branch weekly.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Changes-in-Channel-Experience-and-usage.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></p><p> Lastly, was the buzzword of 'Omnichannel' experience which doesn't seem to be going away.  How can you start a conversation in one channel and accompany the customer as they move through the different channels.</p><p> None-of these themes are new to banking.  However, there is a reason these are still big challenges in the industry.  Banks' legacy systems are real inhibitors to change.  While at the same time, these new FinTech players have an ability to move much quicker.  Next week, in my concluding piece on the findings from the World Retail Banking Report, I'll share the findings on how banks view the evolution of the industry and what role they see FinTech players moving forward.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Want to learn how you can get viable solutions in the hands of your paying customers in five days?</p><h3> Real problems, real solutions</h3><p> Companies attempting to solve big problems tend to get stuck at some point. Sometimes it happens in the very early days when they&rsquo;re just tinkering with ideas. Sometimes it happens years into running the company, when they have new ideas to new problems they&rsquo;ve uncovered. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you categorize the company &mdash; big or small, early or late, tech or toilet paper. If you&rsquo;re tackling a problem that many people care about, the right solution won&rsquo;t always be the one you assumed, the one others have built or the one your customer told you about to begin with. You may need to experiment until you&rsquo;ve found a fit your customers truly value, and in many cases, will pay for.</p><p> <strong>  For instance, do any of these bumps in the road sound familiar? </strong></p><li> You can&rsquo;t decide what to name your company or product.</li><li> You can&rsquo;t decide which problem is the most important to solve.</li><li> You found a problem to solve but the founders are too busy clashing over the right solution.</li><li> You launched your MVP and getting lukewarm (if any) reactions.</li><li> You launched out of beta and MAUs fell off the table.</li><p> I come bearing two pieces of news that should excite you and your cohort. First, every other startup that&rsquo;s ever mattered was once in your same position. Second, this series of articles is designed to give you the structure you need to push through those roadblocks, launch solutions your customers want and build a real, sustainable business.</p><p> So then, let&rsquo;s kick off by learning about the basics of design sprints.</p><h3> Getting familiar with a design sprint</h3><p> The guiding framework we&rsquo;ll be leveraging to help your startup progress is based on Google Venture&rsquo;s Design Sprint.</p><p> At New Haircut, we&rsquo;ve led lots of sprints. We believe in the process. More importantly, the startups we work with believe because of the results we&rsquo;ve been able to achieve together. In an upcoming article in this series, we&rsquo;ll hear from one such startup founder who praises the sprint we ran together.</p><p> <strong>  The birth of the design sprint </strong></p><p> Before they were called design sprints, entrepreneurs and inventors, since the dawn of time, had been conceptualizing ways to cheaply and rapidly prototype ideas.</p><p> One such entrepreneurial-minded chap was Jake Knapp. In the early 2000&rsquo;s, he was working as a product designer at Google. He was surrounded by smart people who had their own promising product ideas. But with limited time and priorities weighted toward products that dominated Google&rsquo;s revenue Googlers&rsquo; pet projects rarely moved beyond ideation.</p><p> Jake realized the lost opportunity. He&rsquo;d need to design a process for rapidly building, testing and iterating solutions. Things would need to happen in days, instead of weeks and months. Then he spotted his first chance when he and 2 others were able to concept a video chat app over a weekend. That app was quickly adopted throughout Google offices around the world and eventually launched to the public as Hangouts.</p><p> The success of Hangouts spurred other sprints. Gmail was launched as the output of another sprint. Sprints were becoming the de facto means of testing &amp; building products throughout Google.</p><p> <strong>  Google Ventures adopts sprints </strong></p><p> The partners at Google Ventures (GV) witnessed this trend within Google. They realized that the startups inside their portfolio could equally benefit from running sprints. So when Jake was asked to join GV as a Design Partner, his challenge was to leverage this process to help their portfolio companies make bold, empowered, data-driven decisions. Quite simply, he was the guy tasked with giving each company their best shot of launching products to market that would take off and produce significant returns to the fund.</p><p> The GV team leveraged that same sprint process to launch companies with the likes of Product Hunt, Uber, Nest and Slack. They succeeded by taking Jake&rsquo;s Google-vetted sprint process, modernizing it, testing it and refining it to the point that nearly any company could prototype solutions to just about any problem.</p><p> <strong>  Optional reading for companies </strong></p><p> GV was able to apply the success of the sprints they managed for their portfolio companies and package the steps required and lessons learned into a book, Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days. And while there&rsquo;s no substitute to participating in a sprint, reading this book will certainly give you a jolt forward in figuring out the right problem to solve and getting that solution to market.</p><p> If you can&rsquo;t quite get to reading it cover-to-cover, or you&rsquo;re the type of person that falls asleep after reading 17 words on a page, try the audio version. You&rsquo;ll also find some additional references at the bottom of this article that complement the book well.</p><p> <strong>  Design sprint 101 </strong></p><p> If you&rsquo;re at all familiar with concepts like lean, agile and MVPs, a design sprint is like a best of from those playbooks. It&rsquo;s a 5-day process that ends in your team collecting actual customer feedback from a prototype of the product you intend to bring to market. It combines the strengths of business strategy, innovation, science and design.</p><h3> Here&rsquo;s an intro to how those 5 days break down: <li>  Day 1: You may first want to kick off by reviewing this slide deck with the team. Afterward, decide upon the most important problem you&rsquo;d like to solve. </li> <li>  Day 2: Individually (but together) sketch out as many solutions to that problem. </li> <li>  Day 3: Vote on the best solution and then add additional details about how that solution would work, start to finish. </li> <li>  Day 4: Design your Goldilocks prototype &mdash; not too complex, not too simple, just right. </li> <li>  Day 5: Test the prototype with customers and capture reactions &amp; feedback. </li> <li>  The more organized and prepared you are, the more you&rsquo;ll get out of these 5 days. Below is a summary, direct from the gang at GV that bullets how to spend your days leading up to day 1 </li> <li>  You&rsquo;ll also want to purchase all of your sprint supplies in advance which can be found in this sprint kit shopping list. </li></h3><p> <strong>  Summary </strong></p><p> Design Sprints are a weapon startups of all shapes and sized can use to discuss, concept, prototype and test solutions they&rsquo;re interested in bringing to market.</p><p> Teams like GV and New Haircut have validated that the sprint process works. We&rsquo;ve seen it produce results most would write off as too good to be true. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to set things in motion within your team and realize the same benefits.</p>",

    "content": "<p> Have you ever thought about what determines the way you define yourself and the choices you make?</p><p> I remember when I was in college studying theatre, the only career option that was discussed was becoming a professional actor.  Yes, I get that we were studying theatre, but in a profession in which only 2% of people who graduate with a theatre degree are able to make a living wage working their craft, you would think someone would be talking about strategies to leverage the skills we were learning, and how to make  a viable living beyond waiting tables and temp&rsquo;ing. But no. Nobody talked about it. Ever.  It was as if simply having the discussion was taboo.</p><p> About 10 years ago, before the birth of OnStage Leadership, I had actually put together a session around the Transferability of Theatre Off-Stage, recognizing that the skills I learned in the theatre were the most valuable skills I used.</p><p>  I was accepted to speak on the topic at International Theatre Conference in Bovec, Slovenia, to a group of theatre students and theatre educators from around the world.  During the session they were all very nice and participatory as they looked at me like I had three horns on my head.  Following the session, very nice German theatre professor said to me, &ldquo;It was interesting, Kimberly.  But actors don&rsquo;t want to think about doing anything but theatre.&rdquo; Several months later I took the same session to the largest Theatre Educator&rsquo;s Conference in the US.  I spent hundreds of dollars on handouts and travel expenses.  My PowerPoint slides were flawless.  I was ready!  Nobody showed up to the session. Not one person. They simply didn&rsquo;t want to have the conversation.</p><p> As I stewed on &ldquo;What happened? Why did nobody come?&rdquo; I realized that I was up against something far bigger than theatre people simply not wanting to discuss the value of their skills.  I was challenging deeply held beliefs that rocked the core of how they defined themselves in the world.  In the theatre, there is no choosing to leave.  You either make it or you don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re either a success or a failure. Special or not special. It&rsquo;s very black and white. In a world of such fierce competition, that requires extraordinary devotion and commitment in the face of overwhelming rejection, to even engage in the conversation about stopping means that you&rsquo;ve failed.  It means that you are a failure.  To stop isn&rsquo;t an option because of what it means about you.</p><p> Some of the most brilliant, gifted, collaborative, insightful, creative, intuitive men and women often stay with a theatre career long past loving it.  They&rsquo;ll minimize their abilities and earning potential, taking low-wage jobs to survive.  They often lose confidence in themselves, struggle with depression and emotional paralysis, because they don&rsquo;t allow themselves to choose anything differently (or they beat themselves up if they venture to think about anything other than theatre) because of what it would mean about them.</p><p> Standing on the other side of it, having left the theatre world and found my way to what, for me personally, is even more fulfilling, I can see that this belief is completely flawed.  That there were always more options than &ldquo;all in&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure&rdquo; &ndash; that one could actually choose to do something else and it didn&rsquo;t mean anything about you other than you simply made a different choice.</p><p> I think we all do this from time to time and it keeps us from being as powerful as we can be.  We hold on to our beliefs of where we have to be, or what we have to do, or what we can&rsquo;t do because of what it would mean about us. </p><p> We stay in careers that are no longer a good fit because of what it would mean.</p><p> We follow a prescribed career track because of what it would mean.</p><p> We hold back our ideas, opinions, and concerns because of what it would mean.</p><p> Parents who would like to stay home with their kids, don&rsquo;t, because of what it would mean.</p><p> Mothers who would like to go back to work, don&rsquo;t, because of what it would mean.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t admit what we don&rsquo;t know, because of what it would mean.</p><p> We don&rsquo;t set boundaries, because of what it would mean.</p><p> We hold on to friendships we&rsquo;ve outgrown, because of what it would mean.</p><p> We do what everyone else is doing &ndash; go to the right schools, join the right clubs, buy the right house, take the right job, put our kids in the right activities, rather than crafting our own path in life because of what it would mean.</p><p> It might mean we don&rsquo;t have what it takes.  It might mean we&rsquo;re not a good person.  It might mean we&rsquo;re a quitter.  It might mean we&rsquo;re not successful.  It might mean we don&rsquo;t care.  It might mean we&rsquo;re selfish.  It might mean we&rsquo;re not good enough.</p><p> What if it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at all?</p><p> Consider, if you take the meaning out of it, you can make a powerful choice that will serve you better.</p><p> Choice.</p><p> How might meaning be preventing you from making the best choices for yourself, for your organization, and for your family?  It&rsquo;s worth giving some thought. </p><p> Because there is power in choice.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Talk to anyone who supervises the marketing or business development function in a professional services firm and you are likely to hear a tale of woe when it comes to finding top talent.</p><p> You&rsquo;ll hear complaints about how experienced professional services marketers lack contemporary digital marketing skills. You may also hear grumbles that the digital marketing wizards are often clueless when it comes to the nuanced demands of professional services marketing and business development.</p><p> Forget about finding someone who has all of the required marketing skill! You&rsquo;d have better luck locating a leprechaun.</p><h3> A Changing Marketplace Requires New Marketing Skills</h3><p> It&rsquo;s no accident that firms find themselves in this dilemma. Profound changes in the professional services marketplace are driving the need for new marketing skills. </p><p> Consider just three trends:</p><p> <strong>  1. It is a digital world. </strong>  The world is going digital&mdash;if it is not there already. Figure 1 shows how the world is adopting digital communications. Got a business-related question? Google it. Want to check out a possible service provider? Look them up on LinkedIn. It&rsquo;s fast, easy and free. <img alt=\"\" height=\"423\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Internet-Users.png\" width=\"768\"/></p><p> Figure 1. The number of Internet users is climbing</p><p> <strong>  2. Digital natives dominate.  </strong> Digital literacy is the new norm. In less than 5 years the millennial generation, who grew up in a digital world, will make up 75% of the workforce. They grew up digital and easily toggle between different technologies, multitasking as they make purchasing decisions.</p><p> <strong>  3. Client expectations are evolving.  </strong> These days clients expect transparency. You cannot fake it&mdash;prospects are sure to investigate your claims about skills and experience. Prospective clients also expect to find the &ldquo;perfect firm&rdquo; that matches their needs exactly. Where that firm is located is secondary, if not irrelevant. And if you think your competitors are all local generalists&mdash;well, guess again.</p><p> What marketing skills will be required to thrive in this new professional services marketplace? Whatever the answer is today, you can bet it will be different tomorrow.</p><h3> Balancing Traditional and Digital Marketing Skills</h3><p> If you thought the solution to the digital marketing skills divide is to hire digital savvy natives you may be disappointed. That is because the most effective marketing strategy involves a balance of both traditional and digital techniques. If you hire for digital marketing skills, you&rsquo;ll lose out on the traditional side.</p><p> Also, professional services are complicated. They often involve a sophisticated interplay of trust, expertise, risk and regulations. You need a deep understanding of the challenges facing your potential clients. It would be wishful thinking to expect a junior team to understand and navigate these complexities.</p><p> And don&rsquo;t forget your billable professionals. They need to understand how to navigate this ever-changing, ever-competitive environment.</p><p> <strong>  Building the Right Team </strong></p><p> No single person is likely to possess all of the marketing skills and sophistication required. It takes a team.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Is-This-Your-Ideal-Marketing-Team.png\" width=\"768\"/></p><p> Figure 2. Is this your ideal marketing team?</p><p>  </p><p> Of course, some of these new marketing skills could reside with outside vendors. But chances are those external resources don&rsquo;t specialize in professional services marketing. Besides, marketing agencies face the same skills gap you do.</p><p> <strong>  Closing the Skills Gap </strong></p><p> When trying to close the skill gap you really have two options:</p><p> <strong>  Option 1: Train for the marketing skills you need. </strong> Maybe your marketing and business development professionals can learn the new marketing skills they don&rsquo;t posses.</p><p> <strong>  Option 2: Hire the marketing skills you need. </strong>  Hire people who have some of the more contemporary digital marketing skills and train them in the emerging science of professional services marketing.</p><p> In either case, the need for training is clear.</p><p> I know of what I speak, because this is the very dilemma we faced at Hinge. We had access to great minds. Some were professional services experts, others were experts in traditional marketing strategies. And we were hiring up-and-coming professionals who had mastered emerging marketing technology. What we lacked was a cohesive whole.</p><p> As we searched for a solution, the magnitude of the problem became clear. Not only did we need to train our existing staff (on changing technology trends), we needed extensive training for new hires (on the specifics of professional services). And that training needed to be ongoing.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> A marketer is a salesperson&rsquo;s best wingman.</p><p> Or at least they should be. Unfortunately, marketing and sales teams within an organization are usually not that fond of one another.</p><p> Typically, marketing generates the leads and sales closes the deal. It&rsquo;s a pass-the-baton type strategy where marketing kicks up their feet once they pass off a lead list and sales is sweating bullets to hit quotas by the end of the month. Each has their own agenda and set of goals that squander any hope for collaborative growth.</p><p> This inefficient dynamic not only hurts revenue, it&rsquo;s the root of the historical battle between sales and marketing teams. The good news is that there is a shift in mindset that can break tensions and increase revenue.</p><p> Matt Heinz, President of Heinz Marketing, shares the organizational mindset that increases revenue by getting sales and marketing on the same page. The first step is to understand the buyer. </p><h3> How Well Do You Really Understand Your Buyer?</h3><p> Both marketing and sales teams need to know your ideal customer inside and out.</p><p> What are their desires, pain points, motivations, and struggles? What compels them to want more information? What pushes them over the edge to buy? Marketers and salespeople need to be in the heads of the buyers from prospecting to closing.</p><p> Knowing these factors will drive marketers to create content that actually speaks to the buyer and will also provide sales reps with information they can use during conversations with prospects. According to Lattice Engines and CSO Insights, 42% of sales reps do not feel like they have the right information before making a sales call. The content created by the marketing team should help sales reps feel confident to engineer their approach so that the prospect feels understood.</p><p> Rather than hunting for a way the product can fit into a buyer&rsquo;s life, they start out as an advocate for the buyer&rsquo;s objectives and the product becomes the solution. In addition, when a rep can bring new knowledge to the table that the prospect didn&rsquo;t know before, they&rsquo;re in the right place to take control of the conversation.</p><p> Matt Heinz says, &ldquo;If the prospect hangs up the phone and says, &lsquo;That was great&mdash;I would have paid for that,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re in the right spot.&rdquo;</p><p> An interesting exercise is to ask your sales reps: &ldquo;If you couldn&rsquo;t talk about the product or service on the first sales call, what would that conversation look like?&rdquo; Minimizing talking leads to more asking, which will have your reps gaining solid intel on the prospect&rsquo;s needs and objectives. This positions your reps to learn more about the buyer and how to best market and sell to them.</p><p> &ldquo;If the first sales call didn&rsquo;t include talking about the product, what would that conversation look like?&rdquo;</p><p> Jeff Thull writes the book, Mastering the Complex Sale, and talks about the importance of helping a prospect discover the cost of a problem they have. The best way to do this is for sales reps to be educated on whom the problem is affecting. Jeff was also featured on the very first episode of the B2B Show, where he shared more about this topic.</p><h3> Sales and Marketing: Becoming a Team</h3><p> Marketing and sales should be partners in crime, yin and yang, two peas in a pod.</p><p> Sales and marketing need to work towards common objectives and metrics. In other words, both teams must be revenue-driven. Being revenue-driven will guide marketers to be more strategic in their approach and cause them to learn about the end user, not just an early prospect.  </p><p> This approach will create a cycle of marketers feeding salespeople well-vetted lead lists and sales call-worthy content and salespeople will provide feedback that will help marketers better understand the buyer&rsquo;s needs and motivations.</p><p> Marketers need to switch their mindset from not just generating volume, but generating the right kind of volume to increase revenue. Getting intel from sales reps about ideal customers will help them better vet their lead lists. Sometimes this will cause lead numbers to go down, but it will result in higher conversion rates for the shortened list.</p><h3> Roles Need to be Clearly Defined</h3><p> If sales and marketing are going to be sharing a peapod, then roles need to be clearly laid out.</p><p> Who plays what role in each step of the sales journey? What messaging needs to be used and when? What is a lead? What is a qualified opportunity?</p><p> Definitions and roles need to be clarified in order for things to run smoothly and this mindset to actually be effective.</p><p> One of the major roles that the marketing and sales teams share is selling and reselling a buyer&rsquo;s commitment to change. When marketing has piqued a prospect&rsquo;s interest enough that they want to make a change, it is up to the sales team to continue to resell that commitment to change throughout the buyer journey.</p><p> It&rsquo;s up to the sales team to resell the buyer&rsquo;s commitment to change throughout the entire sales process.</p><p> Think of it in these terms: Imagine you&rsquo;re thinking about changing jobs and moving into a new industry. Your current job isn&rsquo;t working out, and even though leaving is stepping outside of your comfort zone, you make the decision to leave your current job in the next month.</p><p> Now that you&rsquo;ve made your decision, wouldn&rsquo;t affirmation and validation help you move forward? Instead of doubt and fear creeping in, you could surround yourself with friends who encourage your decision and help you brainstorm next steps.</p><p> This encouraging circle of friends is your sales team.</p><h3> Conclusion</h3><p> We will be the first to admit that these are not simple transitions to make, but getting more of the organization focused on revenue is key. If your main focus in all departments is driving revenue, you&rsquo;re on the right track.</p><p> You&rsquo;ve just got to get your actions steps in place.</p>",

    "title": "9 Reasons Why You Should Be Investing in Short-Term Munis",
    "link": "9-reasons-why-you-should-be-investing-in-short-term-munis",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Who says municipal bonds aren&rsquo;t sexy?</p><p> They were the top fixed-income asset class of 2015, compared to U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds, and they even outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p><p> Still not convinced? Check out the following ways short-term munis can make you scream &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; </p><h3> 1. Tax. Free. Income.</h3><p> One of munis&rsquo; most titillating qualities is that they&rsquo;re tax-free at the federal level.</p><p> But they can also be tax-free at the state level depending on where you live. There are only seven states without an income tax, meaning you&rsquo;re on the hook if you live in those other 43 states. Municipal bonds can minimize the burden.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"468\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Average-Income-Tax-by-State.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 2. Capital preservation</h3><p> Because munis are tax-free, you get to keep more of your wealth in your own pocket.</p><p> NEARX seeks preservation of capital and has had a net asset value (NAV) that&rsquo;s floated in the $2 range. It&rsquo;s demonstrated minimal fluctuation in its share price, even during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/10-Years-Minimal-Daily-Drama.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 3. Low default rate</h3><p> True or false? The odds are greater that you will be struck by lightning than a high-quality muni will default on a payment.</p><p> True! Between 1970 and 2014, not a single Aaa-rated muni defaulted, while Aa and A-rated bonds&mdash;the kinds NEARX heavily invests in&mdash;were highly unlikely to default. Corporate bonds, on the other hand, had an increasing rate of defaults the lower their credit rating and further out from their issuance, according to Moody&rsquo;s.</p><p> The chart below illustrates Moody&rsquo;s findings of default rates between 1970 and 2014. It shows the rise in such rates between year one of a bond&rsquo;s issuance, which could be at any time within the chart&rsquo;s range, and year 10. You can see that munis&rsquo; default rate is near-zero and that Aaa-rated bonds don&rsquo;t even register.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Municipal-versus-corporate-bond-default-rules-by-year.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 4. Calm in times of market turmoil</h3><p> Speaking of &ldquo;moody,&rdquo; even when the S&amp;P 500 was acting sporadically, munis were steady growers. Check out the following chart, which shows a hypothetical investment of $100,000 in the  <a href=\"http://www.usfunds.com/NEARX-Stars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Near-Term Tax Free Fund </a>  and S&amp;P 500 stocks at the end of 1999. (You cannot directly invest in an index.) The equity market had two massive declines during this period, while NEARX rose steadily. In fact, it took 14 years for the equity market to catch up. (Figures include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, but the performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund&rsquo;s prospectus which, if applicable, would lower your total returns.)</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Near-Term-Tax-Free-Fund.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p> Granted, the two major drops in value during this period&mdash;first when the tech bubble burst, then during the financial crisis&mdash;were among the worst the market has ever witnessed. Investors shouldn&rsquo;t expect NEARX to outperform at all times.</p><h3> 5. &hellip;AND in times of rising and falling interest rates</h3><p> You might think longer is always better, but in the case of munis, it pays to be short. Short-term munis&mdash;such as the ones that mostly make up NEARX&mdash;are less sensitive to interest rate stimulation than longer-term instruments. (Bond prices fall when rates go up, and vice versa.) Below, we use Treasury yields to illustrate how munis could be similarly affected:</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Potential-Price-Movement.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 6. CD rates are abysmal right now</h3><p> Speaking of which: Interest rates are at near-zero lows right now, which has tarnished the attractiveness of CDs. Plus, early withdrawals come with a penalty, unlike munis.  </p><p> NEARX yields are as of 3/31/2016. CD rates from FDIC.gov national average as of 3/18/2016. NEARX SEC yield without waiver and reimbursement 0.08 percent.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Compare-Yields.png\" width=\"310\"/></p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Near-Term-Tax-Free-Fund-Bank-CD.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><h3> 7. And savings accounts are even worse</h3><p> Remember when your savings account returned 6 percent? Yeah, that hasn&rsquo;t been the case since the mid-1980s. Today, the savings rate (as of April 18, 2016) is a hardly-there 0.06 percent, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). You can do better than that.</p><p> Municipal bond funds, including NEARX, aren&rsquo;t bank accounts; nor are they FDIC-insured, as bank accounts are. But it&rsquo;s worth making the comparison.</p><h3> 8. Make America strong</h3><p> Want to &ldquo;make America great again&rdquo;? Well, if you invest in short-term munis, you&rsquo;re already doing it! This $3.7 trillion market funds everything from schools to roads to hospitals to utilities&mdash;and more.</p><h3> 9. 21 straight years of positive returns</h3><p> Since 1995, NEARX has delivered positive annual returns&mdash;no matter what interest rates were doing, no matter the condition of the market. This is not to say that NEARX will continue to perform like this indefinitely, only that the fund has a well-tested history of &ldquo;no drama.&rdquo;</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Various-Interest-Rates-Environment.png\" width=\"600\"/></p><p>  </p>",

    "title": "One Simple Strategy to Close the Workforce Gender Gap",
    "link": "one-simple-strategy-to-close-the-workforce-gender-gap",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Closing the gender gap in the workforce is a big task for any inclusive leader.</p><p> There are a range of considerations. Where do we start? Do we try to tackle the wage gap first? Or should we first address the number of women in leadership roles?  </p><p> Though the options to begin closing the gender gap are seemingly endless, and frequently challenging, there&rsquo;s one strategy that could be pretty easily implemented into the workplace: increasing digital fluency in women. </p><p> In Valentina Zarya&rsquo;s Fortune article  <u>  <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/03/women-digitally-fluent/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   &ldquo;The Best Thing Women Can Do to Close the Gender Pay Gap,&rdquo;  </a> </u>  she explains that digital fluency is determined by how much a person embraces and uses digital technology, and whether an individual tries to enhance, or increase, his or her technological knowledge. </p><p> This definition may imply that women need to become more involved in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) programs. However, being digitally fluent can actually be as simple as having access to computers, tablets and smartphones. It&rsquo;s about having Internet access so women can create and learn more about social media platforms. It&rsquo;s using computer programs such as Microsoft Office and the Adobe Creative Suite.</p><h3> It seems too easy, doesn&rsquo;t it?</h3><p> However, there are plenty of schools in the United States that don&rsquo;t have updated computers and technology. Also, some individuals can&rsquo;t afford the cost of technology on their own, meaning that they can&rsquo;t improve their skills on their own time. This, in turn, puts women at a disadvantage when applying for jobs and promotions.</p><p> According to Julie Sweet, the North American group chief of Accenture, &ldquo;Being tech savvy has a positive effect on women&rsquo;s career prospects, and the benefits for women are even more profound than they are for men.&rdquo; Sweet even goes so far as to say that, if we double our efforts to increase digital fluency in our female employees, we could completely close the gender gap by 2040.</p><h3> So what can we do as inclusive leaders? How do we increase the digital fluency of women in our workplaces?</h3><p> One way to improve digital fluency is to hold regular training sessions. This could be as basis as offering training on new Microsoft Word functions, or how to use Mac computers. These sessions might also focus on teaching basic HTML skills. Whatever the focus of your training, what&rsquo;s important is to cast a wide net to make sure as many of your female workers as possible are engaged in the training. Increasing education about technology will help make the women in your office more confident and ready for promotional opportunities.</p><p> Keep in mind that, although Zarya&rsquo;s article focus on women, you may have other populations within your workplace that could also benefit from digital skills training including employees from various minority groups, older employees and, yes, even your male employees. Don&rsquo;t assume that any one group is more or less astute than others.</p><p> Inequities exist in the workplace for a variety of reasons. Skills gaps shouldn&rsquo;t be one of them. Make sure you&rsquo;re assessing for gaps and introducing options to help close those gaps. Be inclusive!</p>",

    "link": "your-finances-deserve-an-upgrade-too-how-the-new-iphone-se-is-just-like-your-finances",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> The iPhone SE has hit the stands, and like all of the iPhones before it, the craze for getting this new device ensues.</h3><p> <br/> For the iPhone aficionado, the new phone features a 4-inch screen with retina display, 12-mega pixels iSight rear-facing camera, A9 processor and M9 motion coprocessor, and touch fingerprint sensor.  To me, it comes in four different colors, I hear the pictures are pretty great and it&rsquo;s smaller, so it will hopefully now fit in my back pocket. </p><p> So what does the iPhone have anything to do with finance? Well, I have shaped my career around empowering women to take the driver&rsquo;s seat in understanding their finances. However, I still find that for many women personal finance that goes beyond everyday bills is not a priority, especially once they get married. Often, their husband becomes in charge of everything money related, from bank accounts to retirement plans, and especially investments. As a financial advisor and a woman, my job is to empower women to be strong, to educate themselves and to think for themselves.</p><h3> With that said, it became very clear to me exactly how these women feel when it comes to their money and their marriage.</h3><p> <br/> When it comes to technology, I am the same way. If the internet is down, my husband will take care of it. If we need a new computer, a printer or a TV, I let him take care of it. Even when it comes to something as simple as my new phone, I automatically deflect any &lsquo;technology&rsquo; questions or decisions to my husband.</p><p> We were recently at an AT&amp;T store as I was finally ready to make use of my upgrade for a new iPhone. The AT&amp;T representative, very nicely, went through all the different features of the new phone and mentioned how it differed from my current one. He kept asking me questions about what I was looking for, what I thought about this feature or that, and my immediate response was to look at my husband and defer any and all questions to him.</p><p> After several instances of my husband answering for me, the AT&amp;T representative politely interrupted and said, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am I asked you the question. This phone is for you, not for him.&rdquo; It was at this moment that I realized this AT&amp;T employee was doing exactly what I set myself to do every time I walk into my office. I was acting like many of the women I meet when they first come in, inexperienced, insecure, and afraid. Why was I letting someone else make this decision for me? Why wasn&rsquo;t I trying to empower myself?</p><p> It dawned on me that whether it is technology or finance, women are more likely to take a step back if they are not knowledgeable about or interested in the subject. It might not matter much if your new phone has retina display or a rear-facing camera but when it comes to your finances, these small details can have a huge impact on your daily life and your financial future.</p><h3> Here are 3 ways to upgrade your finances: <br/>  </h3><h3> <strong>  1. Get the Clearest Picture: </strong></h3><p> The first and most important thing you can do is to understand your whole financial picture. Not sure where to start? Start by tracking how much you make, how much you spend, and how much you save. There are amazing tools like <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  Mint.com </a> that help make this as easy as clicking a button. </p><h3> <strong>  2.  SE stands for Saving for Emergencies: </strong></h3><p> Make sure you build up an emergency fund that can cover 3-6 months of your expenses. You might know the date for every new iPhone release, but you can&rsquo;t predict an emergency and you need to be ready if something were to come up.  Whether it is losing your job, your car breaking down or a sudden medical issue, a solid emergency fund can help protect you from these unexpected events.</p><h3> <strong>  3. Downsize Your Phone Not Your Savings: </strong></h3><p> One of the most notable features of the new iPhone is its smaller size. However, your savings is the one &lsquo;financial feature&rsquo; you should be upgrading. Make sure you are maxing out your retirement savings, especially if your employer offers a match on your company 401K. If you don&rsquo;t have a company 401K, open up an IRA or Roth IRA and make sure to automate your contributions. Ideally, you want to save anywhere from 10-20% of your income. This might seem daunting but start small by setting aside maybe 3-5% of your income and slowly make your way to up.</p><p> As women, we need to stop taking the back seat and jump in the driver&rsquo;s seat when it comes to our lives.</p><h3> Technology? No problem. Personal finance? Bring it on.</h3><p> <br/> Personal finance is not a shiny new toy or man&rsquo;s hobby, but a critical part of our lives that we need to understand as women, daughters, sisters, and especially wives and mothers. Don&rsquo;t wait until a man from the AT&amp;T store stands up for you, stand up for yourself and your financial future.</p><p> If my husband and I split up, I might not know the first thing about playing our AppleTV or fixing a problem on my iPad, but I know that I will not need to depend on anyone else to secure my financial future. </p>",

    "title": "What is Women's Finance, Anyways?",
    "link": "what-is-womens-finance-anyways",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> When I tell people that I am a women&rsquo;s financial specialist, I often get questions like:</p><h3> &ldquo;What is women&rsquo;s finance, anyways?  How could money really be that different for a woman?&rdquo;</h3><p> <br/> Well, the truth is that money is the same color green for women and men.  And I don&rsquo;t believe any of the myths that people say: that women can or can&rsquo;t get as much, women are better or worse investors than men, that certain investment moves are more appropriate for women than for men, that women are better or worse at saving than men.</p><p> What I do believe, however, is that as we women go through life we may tend to be more likely to find ourselves in certain financial positions because of our obligations to our families.  Here&rsquo;s what I mean:</p><li> Becoming the primary caretaker for children as a single mother, either by choice or by circumstance</li><li> Experiencing a disrupted income stream as a result of absence from work due to pre- or post-natal complications</li><li> Bearing the financial burden of caring for an aging parent</li><li> Being viewed as a less qualified or reliable candidate for a higher paying job due to pregnancy or having had children</li><li> More likely to divorce if outearning her husband</li><li> Less likely to strike out on her own as business owner</li><li> Less likely to pursue and pay for financial advice on her own, without a partner, before being married or having an immediate need to put a plan in place</li><li> Less likely to participate actively in financial planning process if partner handles the household finances</li><li> Having to work a reduced or modified scheduled due to childcare commitments</li><li> Less likely to grasp her full economic value to the household and hence protect household from loss of life or disability</li><li> More likely to be left in the dark about finances after divorce of loss of a partner</li><li> Needing to make extensive changes to financial documentation due to changes in our last names</li><li> More likely to be in charge of employing and pay a caregiver for a child or parent <br/>  </li><p> I have to admit that as a female professional and mother at the same time, it is my natural instinct to attend to my needs if and only after each of my children&rsquo;s needs have been met.  And in doing this I find myself flattened by the weight of a huge, crushing ball of responsibility rolling over me.  The times when I have allowed this to happen, it has resulted in drain on financial resources and choking loss of control over lifestyle.</p><p> Women&rsquo;s finance is a strategy that elevates *equity* or ownership of financial resources where there is such a void.  This strategy is executed in a way that is sensitive to and incorporates an understanding of the issues specific to women&rsquo;s lives.</p><p> Women&rsquo;s finance positions the woman at the center, not the bottom, of the financial sphere.  Here she&rsquo;s in a position of control.  Instead of a passive stance, it is based upon decisions and awareness of options.</p><h3> <strong>  The foundation of women&rsquo;s finance is protection. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Avoids underestimation or misunderstanding of our economic value to our households even if our work is not paid for in hard dollars</li><li> Ensures that the strategy self completes even in the event of loss of income to disability <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  The second component of this strategy is saving. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Avoiding loss of savings by increasing their awareness of the &ldquo;leaks&rdquo; that occur such as taxes and fees</li><li> Encouraging women to secure adequate and liquid reserves to avoid credit problems in the event of life changes that reduce income <br/>  </li><h3> <strong>  Once protection and savings are secured, the strategy focuses on growth. </strong> <br/>  </h3><li> Accelerating the growth of wealth by putting every dollar to its most efficient use from the point of first entry into the sphere</li><li> Balancing statement wealth with guaranteed wealth to ensure that you never run out of money at times when you or someone you care for may need it <br/>  </li><p> I do what I do, and I write what I write, because it is my sincere goal to change the lives of women in society for the better.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<h3> Customer Service is Simple</h3><p> My belief is that customer service is simple. At least it is on the surface. It can be as simple as just being nice to a customer. Being nice, showing empathy, being sincere &ndash; these are some of the basics of customer service, and they seem pretty simple. Of course there is much more to delivering an amazing customer service experience than just being nice, but that&rsquo;s a pretty good start.</p><p> So, let&rsquo;s get back to the concept of simple. Changing a company&rsquo;s culture is not easy, yet I preach the concept of Six Simple Steps to Creating a Customer-Focused Culture. Are they really simple steps? Yes, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are easy.</p><h3> Simple is about understanding: Being easy is about execution</h3><p> While something as simple as being nice might be easy for some, there are concepts, strategies and tactics about customer service that are not.</p><p> One day I was presenting to a group of C-Suite executives. The topic was about the culture of the company, and I was covering the six simple steps mentioned above. After going through the six steps, one of the audience members raised his hand and asked, &ldquo;How long will it take to implement these six steps in my company?&rdquo;</p><p> I responded, &ldquo;How many employees do you have?&rdquo;</p><p> He said there were about 30,000 employees. I told him it could take four or five years, even longer.</p><p> He was shocked and said, &ldquo;You said it was simple!&rdquo;</p><p> And, I replied, &ldquo;I did say it was simple, but I didn&rsquo;t say it was easy. As a matter of fact, it is hard.&rdquo;</p><p> I believe that most people know what customer service is. Some even say its common sense. People know what excellent &ndash; even outstanding &ndash; customer service is. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they are capable of delivering it. Their personalities may not be in alignment with the company&rsquo;s values and goals toward customer service. Maybe their jobs don&rsquo;t typically require it (although I believe that just about everyone has at least internal customers that need to be serviced). </p><p> The companies that put forth the effort to be better than average or satisfactory win. They hire good people and train them well. As simple as that sounds, it does take effort; sometimes lots of effort. Hey, if it was easy&hellip; everyone would be doing it!</p><p> Let&rsquo;s really simplify this with a non-business example. Going on a diet is a perfect metaphor for the concept that simple isn&rsquo;t easy. I decided that I wanted to lose five pounds. My wife offered up some simplistic advice and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. Just stop eating so many desserts.&rdquo; The problem is, it&rsquo;s not easy. You see, I love desserts, but her advice makes sense. If I want to lose weight, just eat healthier. Simple! Then why is there a multi-billion dollar diet industry to help people lose weight? Because it&rsquo;s not easy&hellip; Yet it sounds so simple!</p>",

    "content": "<p> About a decade ago, I was working in corporate America, attending several in-person meetings and decided that I &ldquo;wanted to be taken more seriously,\" because let's face it, I'm blond, and, well, people stereotype&hellip; So I thought I would get a pair of eyeglasses that would make me look smart and &ldquo;geeky-sheeky&rdquo;.  I became so consumed with the appropriate \"look\" I ended up missing important points brought up in meetings, body language that might've been important, etc. So in essence, instead of being &ldquo;taken more serious&rdquo; I actually fit the stereotype (gasp) -  buh-bye glasses!</p><p> As time passed I discovered I truly DID need glasses. Off to the eye doctor I went, and was given a prescription. Naturally, they encouraged me to select a pair of frames from their eyewear boutique. As one who loves unique designers and fashion none of the frames found in the Doctor&rsquo;s eyewear boutique fit my needs.</p><p> So, I took my prescription and headed to the most fashion forward eyewear store out there &ndash; and within minutes found more than 3 pairs of eyewear that fulfilled all my requirements. In a sense, I employed Boolean logic in looking for the perfect eyewear: eyewear AND fashion - the same should hold true when looking for ideal prospects.</p><h3> What is Boolean logic?</h3><p> <br/> Boolean logic was named after the 19th century mathematician George Boole. It&rsquo;s basically a form of algebra in which values are reduced to TRUE or FALSE. Complicated? No. It&rsquo;s actually super easy to learn AND it greatly improves the accuracy of your LinkedIn Advance Search results in seconds &ndash; giving you a warm lead list of your ideal prospects.</p><p> Bottom line - Boolean searches can help you find exactly who you&rsquo;re looking for in the shortest amount of time by using specific modifiers in a search field.</p><p> Learn how to use Boolean Logic by watching the following <u>  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/E2MDN8N_pDo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   video  </a> </u> and be sure to download the Boolean Search <u>  <a href=\"http://www.lauravirili.com/docs/LinkedInAdvancedSearch2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Quick Reference Guide  </a> </u> . </p>",

    "content": "<p> I got my first job in financial services with MFS in 1987 and could not have dreamed of a better opportunity as a rookie internal wholesaler. They had (have) some of the best wholesalers in the country and these folks were always willing to share their best ideas that appealed to the advisors we all served and called on. Some of the best wholesalers would record their presentations on a cassette recorder, then give copies of the cassettes to some of the hungry young superstars in the making. As internal wholesalers, we craved success stories and better ways to present a sales idea to the advisors we called.</p><p> When I became the manager of the internal wholesalers, we met and shared the success stories we heard, then shared them by phone that week. It was the best way to learn at that time.</p><p> Over the years in the 1990s, I was a wholesaler with several firms and enjoyed attending numerous National Sales Meetings with my peers. Most of the meetings were fun and had a few opportunities to bond, but being out of the 'field' during four days of meetings was costly. My FAVORITE part of the meeting was often crammed into the last 2-3 hours on Friday, before we all left for the airport. Those few hours were filled with 5-10 minute presentations from our best, most successful wholesalers or sales managers. They'd share ideas on products, cold calling, asking for referrals, how to strengthen relationships and cross selling. I couldn't write fast enough, so I also recorded their ideas with a cassette recorder. Yes, this is long before iPhones of course. Most wholesalers would leave with a brain filled with ideas, but after a week or two, the memories faded like sunburn. After 90 days, most forgot about eighty percent of what they had learned.</p><p> It was a &lsquo;WOW&rsquo; in the beginning, but over time the brain didn't remember most of the 2-3 hours of Best Practices. As a top performer and ranked number one in sales among my peers, I repeatedly listened to the cassettes while I drove the highways hosting meetings and seminars. I reiterated what I learned as if I had created this great content.</p><h3> That&rsquo;s not stealing content.  We call it sharing best ideas with our own personality.</h3><p> <br/> Technological Breakthrough</p><p> <strong>  Well now, with the help of technology, there is a tremendously better way to share these best practices with the wholesalers, RVPs, Sales managers and internal wholesalers. </strong></p><p> The impact is powerful, the cost is substantially less than the cost of National Sales Meetings and these training videos from your sales teams are available 24/7.  There is a Boston-based company that has developed software that has WOWED thousands of seasoned and successful sales veterans. Allego.com is a Boston based company that has brought training to a level that makes cassette-learning look like I lived in the Stone Age.  Think about the amount of time sales managers spent in the field, traveling with their wholesalers and watching them present to groups of advisors. The best manages would offer advice after the presentation and hopefully, the wholesaler would retain it until the next sales manager visit in three months.  But now, with the technology that Allego.com offers, whether it&rsquo;s an existing product or service, or a new offering, your sales rep can record a video to share with you; then you or a designated member of your team can provide point-in-time feedback, accelerating the rep&rsquo;s ability to master their pitch in every sales situation. - See more at <a href=\"http://www.allego.com/problems-solved/coaching-feedback/ - sthash.9oIEWbg7.dpuf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   here  </u> </a> .</p><p> <strong>  The national sales meeting is still a great opportunity to introduce new products and features that can energize the team. </strong></p><p> But be sure to capture the presentations on video and break them into small, searchable chunks so reps can easily refresh themselves on these topics, as they need them. This just-in-time approach to learning ensures reps have access to the content they need at the time they need it most.</p><p> Yes, times have changed from the way we did business in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. I wholeheartedly embrace technology if it'll make us more effective at what we do, and from what I see, Allego has done it. Never before could videos be captured and shared so easily.</p><p> Here's a <a href=\"http://www.allego.com/blog/re-thinking-the-national-sales-meeting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <u>   link  </u> </a> that explains this process even better.</p><p> We are in a competitive business. If there are tools that help us improve dramatically in less time and at a lower expense, I'm all ears and eyes!</p><p> Just as the cassettes helped many of us remember and then present these great ideas from our best wholesalers, now you can watch actual videos from your peers and sales managers on your iPad or smart phone. This is amazing to a Baby Boomer like me! Sales Superstars are always looking for ways to be more effective. And of course, if combined with solid relationship building skills, we all know that sales will not only increase, they will soar!</p><p> Wishing you even more success in the next quarter!</p>",

To help you, I asked the  <u>  Seniorcare.com </u>  Aging Council:</p><h3> What strategies do you suggest individuals use to make the end-of-life discussions natural and relaxed?</h3><li> We assist them to voice their concerns, like potential family discord, tough questions about death, end of life care, creditors and taxes. We explain that it will help protect their loved ones, make their wishes known, put them in charge of their finances, and that lack of action will benefit the IRS. Discussions may lead to further family closeness, and is essentially a love letter to loved ones. </li><li> The most active influence to help end of life care situations is to have your legal documents in place, and clearly express what treatments you want or don't want in the end. Arrange the support team (palliative or hospice care) and advocates (family and professional) to say when \"enough is enough\" for medical interventions.</li><li> As a family, have conversations about your parent's wishes for the end. That's how my handled our father-in-law's wishes. It was crystal clear to all of us what he wanted and what we had to do if he could not. </li><li> Put together your entire care team: the professional advisors like estate planning attorney, a financial advisor, a care manager, home care team, hospice, and long-term primary care doctor to manage the practicalities in the manner you or a loved one prefers. </li><li> Since my mother had cared for my dad for many years -- he also had Alzheimer's disease -- she knew firsthand about hospice care. Consequently, in the final month of her life, we moved Mom into my home. It was possible because of the skilled hospice team, that provided incredible support and services. I can't say enough about them!</li><li> Amy Goyer of AARP talks about the challenges that adult caregivers have juggling their work, personal needs and health with caregiving responsibilities. Without this support, caregivers can easily become discouraged and blame themselves as 'failing' during these often overwhelming challenges. BodyAwareGrieving.com.</li><li> Our plan included discussions with a doctor about a loved one's diagnosis, and following the physician's advice. Once, we called in hospice but asked a lot of questions and made decisions based on my mother's preferences for dad.</li><li> Depending on the illness and prognosis, a person can use the information to determine a course for treatment, pain management or turn to hospice. As a family, we were able to select one clear path to facilitate the end of life care. With information and family agreements, the challenges or post-care are handled with ease. </li>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> For most people, the money saved in their 401(k) is their single largest retirement asset aside from the equity in their home. It&rsquo;s no wonder the Department of Labor (DOL) recently made an important ruling regarding how these assets are handled by financial advisors.</p><p> In its original form, the DOL fiduciary rule required anyone selling financial products for retirement plans to act as fiduciaries&mdash;meaning they would be legally bound to always act in the best interest of the client.</p><p> It even went so far as to propose banning the sale of certain high-commission products into these plans. As a fee-only registered investment advisor, I already am committed to putting our clients&rsquo; best interests above our own, so I was all for the proposed changes. I&rsquo;ve seen too many people buy insurance products without knowing that the salesperson did not have the client&rsquo;s best interest in mind.</p><p> A new client, Brenda, emailed me last week. At 35, she recently changed jobs, and as is often the case, an insurance company contacted her to offer her &ldquo;free assistance&rdquo; to help her through the transition. Even though she is relatively young, she&rsquo;s been smart about funding her 401(k) and has been putting in 8% of her salary since her first day on the job, so she has just under $110K in her account.</p><p> The salesman suggested Brenda roll over her existing 401(k) into an annuity inside an IRA. He also suggested she purchase a $1M term life insurance policy which would eventually be converted to permanent life insurance. And while he suggested she continue to fund the 401(k) at her new employer, he recommended additional contributions to an IRA, even though, unlike her 401(k) contributions, these would not be tax deductible.</p><p> Brenda was hesitant. &ldquo;I understand they get paid commissions on these insurance policies, and that they&rsquo;re not always a good idea,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve also heard that the DOL rule that&rsquo;s been in the news lately doesn&rsquo;t allow anyone to sell me a policy that isn&rsquo;t right for my situation. Any input? I appreciate your advice and guidance.&rdquo;</p><p> The first thing I told Brenda was that the new rules don&rsquo;t go into effect until at least April of 2017. Second, only retirement products such as 401(k)s and IRAs are covered by the ruling, so the $1M life insurance policy is specifically excluded from the fiduciary requirement. So while the salesman&rsquo;s actions are legal (a least for the time being), they may not be entirely ethical. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><p> Rolling over Brenda&rsquo;s 401(k) into an annuity IRA earns the salesman an up-front commission of about $6,600 (6% of $110,000). As well, Brenda is subject to surrender penalties for 15 years if she takes out an amount over the &ldquo;allowable&rdquo; penalty-free rules. In contrast, by rolling over her 401(k) directly into her new employer&rsquo;s 401(k) plan, Brenda would avoid these fees and commissions completely, and 100% of her retirement would be in one place with solid investment choices. As her financial advisor, I will advise her on which funds to select in her new account at no charge.</p><p> As for the recommended life insurance policy, at Brenda&rsquo;s age, a term policy is what she needs&mdash;no need to pay for a convertible, commission-based product which would increase her monthly premium from $50 to $250. Plus, I know Brenda&rsquo;s personal situation well, and a $1M policy is more coverage than she needs. Again, it seems that selling a higher-priced product is taking a front seat to Brenda&rsquo;s real needs.</p><p> After I walked Brenda through her options, she was relieved&mdash;not only did she have a better picture of the best path forward, but she also felt she had new knowledge to make better decisions in the future. &ldquo;Unfortunately, this is all a foreign language to me,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;He was so persuasive, and even though I knew enough to be wary, I didn&rsquo;t have all the facts.&rdquo; I assured her she wasn&rsquo;t alone: most people simply don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know. Not all insurance and life insurance salespeople are swindlers, but they&rsquo;re usually coming from a different perspective than an independent registered investment advisor (RIA). As the old saying goes, &ldquo;If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&rdquo;</p><p> At Guerin Financial, we&rsquo;ve been serving our clients as fiduciaries for more than 20 years. That means we offer objective, fee-only advice based on one thing only: the specific needs of each client. Whether you work with us or another advisor, take the DOL&rsquo;s attention to the issue as a warning&mdash;but certainly no guarantee&mdash;and get your guidance from a fiduciary who has a lot more tools in his or her toolbox and, most importantly, is committed to always working in your best interest.</p>",

    "content": "<p> In the past, introverted people have been considered a poor match for sales roles as most people associate salespeople with extroversion.</p><p> But interestingly, there is very little data to back this assumption. In fact, more and more data is suggesting the opposite.</p><p> I asked the self-described \"Sales Introvert\" Alen Mayer to explain the paradox. Here's what he had to say.</p><h3> What does \"introvert\" mean?</h3><p> An introvert is not easily defined but can be best understood as a collection of preferences.</p><p> An introvert by definition is a person who prefers solitary activities such as writing and listening to music over more social ones, and they enjoy time spent alone. They find less reward in time spent at large social events, though they may enjoy interactions with close friends. Most notably, an introvert likes to observe situations before participating.</p><h3> Why do introverts find success in sales?</h3><p> The first major sales strength of an introvert is composure. Often mistaken for being too reserved or shy, introverts are able to sit back in the heat of the moment to give themselves a better vantage point.</p><p> Secondly, introverted salespeople put a high priority on relationship building with customers and clients. They are far more likely to build long-term streams of revenue by working with the same customers again and again.</p><p> Introverts also have a keen, well-trained ability to listen to prospects. Often, customers want to talk about what they are dealing with, explain the issue, and discuss what really matters to them.</p><p> Introverts are passionate about the work and projects they are assigned to. This \"love\" of work goes far beyond just receiving a paycheck and completing tasks.</p><p> Persistence is another common trait introverts can draw upon. Similar to passion, persistence involves sticking with a project or task even when it becomes difficult. They will hold on even if it requires additional resources and attention to make it happen.</p><p> Finally, introverts have a keen ability to observe  and draw conclusions from watching other people and how they behave.</p><h3> How does an introvert land a sales job?</h3><p> While introverts are often overlooked during the traditional cover letter and resume process, they are in very high demand on job-matching platforms. When the extraversion bias is stripped away, introverts rise to the top for a lot of businesses</p><p> Are you a sales introvert or extrovert? Ambivert?

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Mothers are great. They feed you, they love you unconditionally, and they also dispense motherly advice at nearly every turn.</p><p> Looking back, some of these &ldquo;mom-isms&rdquo; have unintended, hidden wisdom to them.</p><p> Let&rsquo;s look at some of the sayings we all heard growing up and show how they were, in fact, actually really great business advice on how to run a small business: </p><h3> &ldquo;Do you think your socks are going to pick themselves up?&rdquo;</h3><p> Running a business is all about accountability and responsibility. It&rsquo;s easy to see a nagging problem in your business and hope that it will resolve itself over time. It won&rsquo;t. Sooner or later, you&rsquo;re going to have to go over there, assess the issue, and put a process into place that will set things on a better course. Take inventory of your business for a moment &ndash; are there any socks lying around that need to be put in the laundry? Equally important:  are there holes in some of your programs that may need dramatic replacement.</p><h3> &ldquo;If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?&rdquo;</h3><p> This mom-ism is usually uttered because you&rsquo;re asking to do something and using &ldquo;but so-and-so is doing it&rdquo; as your reason for wanting to do it yourself. Thankfully, mom was all over that one. In business, mindlessly following the crowd is one of the surest ways to run into problems. When you see your competitors &ndash; or even businesses you really admire &ndash; going in a particular direction, instead of just flocking there, look at why they&rsquo;re doing it, how it&rsquo;s working, and whether it&rsquo;s actually right for you. Mom might be right; they could be jumping off of bridges, and no, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to join them. For example, startups like sharing sites (Uber and Air B&amp;B), apps, and rental services are a dime a dozen. Why are you different, and do you have the capital to succeed?</p><h3> &ldquo;Because I said so.&rdquo;</h3><p> It&rsquo;s so easy to end up over-justifying yourself to everyone. It&rsquo;s human nature when you&rsquo;re being second-guessed. But you know what? It takes time and lots of energy to always explain yourself. We too often focus on justifying or over-examining decisions. Input and alternatives are critical in developing programs and adapting to results. However, strategies like testing, pivoting, and &ldquo;just do it&rdquo; are frequently better than rationalizing forever. Focus on what&rsquo;s important because you just can&rsquo;t make everyone happy, and it&rsquo;ll crush you and your business if you try.</p><h3> &ldquo;I am going to count to three and then you better be in your bed.&rdquo;</h3><p> What&rsquo;s one of the most important elements to any sale? Urgency. The pain of missing out is one of the most powerful motivators to get people to take action and buy your product. Here, mom is threatening a different kind of pain, but the principle is all the same. You have a limited time to act, and that urgency produces action more often than not.</p><h3> Call me when you get there, just so I know you&rsquo;re OK.</h3><p> This worried mom-ism comes from a place of love. She just wants to know that everything is going fine and that you&rsquo;re safe. Customers are much the same. When a customer orders a product, send him or her a confirmation e-mail. When you&rsquo;re shipping the product, send tracking information. Customers want to know that everything&rsquo;s OK and that their product and their money is being handled safely.</p>",

    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> I was a new agent and had just been given my first surveillance assignment. I sat outside the subject&rsquo;s house and waited. And waited.</p><p> For something&mdash;anything&mdash;to happen. Hours later, I found myself asleep. Actually, it was a supervisor who found me and blew his horn. I jolted awake but I had been caught; it was both an embarrassing experience and a spectacular failure.</p><p> The pain of my failure was so acute that I never wanted to experience it again.</p><p> As leaders, entrepreneurs and business owners, you will experience failure and setbacks; and by now, you also probably know that you can learn a lot from them.</p><p> Unfortunately, the truly useful failures that change our thoughts and behavior (as opposed to merely stupid decisions) are somewhat rare. But it is possible to treat all failure and setbacks as strategic input on how to improve performance next time.</p><p> It didn&rsquo;t take long for the supervisor who found me asleep on the surveillance assignment to spread the word to my colleagues. I swallowed my pride, kept a positive attitude, found ways to get interested in my assignment, and rewrote the ending by changing the focus from what I did wrong to what I was doing right.</p><p> Here are four ways you can overcome spectacular failure and setbacks: </p><h3> 1. Puncture The Ego And Admit Your Failure</h3><p> The higher up the chain of command, the harder it is to admit a mistake.</p><p> But, the best thing a leader can do is share a few personal failures with other team members. This is where a big dose of humility and a small ego will serve them well. Mentally tough leaders do not always have to be right.</p><p> TIP: When you communicate this to other team members, it does several things:</p><li> Assures them you won&rsquo;t point the finger of blame at someone if something goes wrong</li><li> Encourages others to be more open, and honest, about their performance</li><li> Creates an environment of innovation and experimentation</li><li> Indicates that you truly understand the consequences of creative problem solving</li><li> Gives others permission to bring potential problems to leadership&rsquo;s attention earlier rather than later</li><p> Too often, leadership talks about a strategy of &ldquo;trial and error&rdquo; but their reaction to failure undermines their message.</p><h3> 2. Maintain The Right Attitude About Failure</h3><p> People with strong mind make their emotions obey their logic.</p><p> Mental toughness is managing your emotions, thoughts, and behavior in ways that will set you up for success. Your rational and thinking brain may understand the value of risk and failure, but your emotional, limbic brain system does not!</p><p> The only way to take control of your emotions is to focus on what you are actually learning from the experience.</p><p> As your brain learns, it adapts. What created fear, initially, is tempered by the thinking brain&rsquo;s ability to see positive outcomes in the midst of a disappointment, failure, or setback. The more you fail, the less you&rsquo;re afraid of it. And that is a good thing because it means you&rsquo;re in control of your emotions.</p><p> TIP: If you focus on what you&rsquo;ve learned, it suppresses the negative emotional reaction.</p><p> Remember&mdash;the key to success is avoiding the same mistake next time&mdash;so fail, but learn the lesson.</p><h3> 3. Start Asking The Right Questions About Failure</h3><p> Rather than having all the answers, ask more questions.</p><p> The best questions always start with, &ldquo;How, when, why, and what?&rdquo; These are open-ended questions that invite conversation and discussion.</p><p> Curiosity is the foundation of life-long growth. If we remain curious, we remain teachable so that our minds and hearts grow larger with each passing day. We can retain our beginner&rsquo;s mind by always looking forward and discovering new experiences and uncovering new information.</p><p> Success seduces us into becoming set in our ways. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working,&rdquo; we say to ourselves, so we settle into comfort zones that begin to look more and more like ruts as we age.</p><p> TIP: Curiosity is important for peak performance because it:</p><li> Makes your mind active instead of passive</li><li> Encourages you to be more observant of new ideas</li><li> Opens up new worlds and possibilities</li><li> Creates an adventurous response that leads you in a new direction</li><h3> 4. Wrap Failutre Up The Right Way</h3><p> Behavioral scientists have indicated that the way in which we predict our future behavior is determined by our past memories.</p><p> If team members end a project with a sense of failure and hopelessness, their only memory of the experience will be negative. They will not move on to another project with a sense of growth.</p><p> As the leader, entrepreneur, or business owner, you have the power to create an atmosphere of trust and appreciation&mdash;whether or not the project was a failure or a success.</p><p> In the book, The Other &ldquo;F&rdquo; Word, the authors suggest that the best workplaces are formed on a foundation of trust, and trust is not forged when things are going great. Instead, it is formed when things are not going great because this is when team members learn who has their back.</p><p> TIP: There is a difference between failing, and learning from your failure. Learning from failure is an active process that requires you to put as much thought into it as you do how you plan to achieve success.</p><p> It&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of complacency when confronted with a failure or setback because it takes more effort to extract the lesson to be learned than it does to shrug, give up, and move on.</p>",

    "title": "Which Is Better: SEO or Email?",
    "link": "which-is-better-seo-or-email",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Developing a digital marketing strategy can be a confusing undertaking. When you first start considering your options for reaching your customers, you see that there is a lot of data supporting different kinds of marketing efforts. Email is the best way to grow your brand, cry so many statistics. But SEO is the best way to get your website in front of buying customers, cry others.</p><p> When you&rsquo;re deciding how to invest your marketing budget, you might come across this kind of &ldquo;one or the other&rdquo; thinking, especially in regards to SEO and email marketing. Today, we&rsquo;ve got your answer.</p><h3> The Answer Is Both</h3><p> <br/> As frustrating an answer as it might be, the best approach is a mix of both of these marketing tactics (as well as others, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/social-media\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   social media marketing  </a> </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.rickwhittington.com/consulting/online-marketing/content-marketing-strategy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   content marketing  </a> </u> ).</p><p> Sales happen as a result of high-touch, high-relevance marketing that helps your customers understand how you meet their needs. Balancing your approach to marketing based on your unique customer mix is more important than any data you could source.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s what this might look like for your business:</p><p> For some industries, SEO brings a better ROI based on customer behavior. If your customers rely on search to research solutions to their problems, then investing in your website&rsquo;s SEO should be a higher portion of your budget than email marketing.</p><p> For other companies, especially those that rely on discounts, word-of-mouth marketing, and personal referrals, email runs the show. Reaching customers who have opted into your content in their inbox will be more valuable than any ranking SEO could bring you.</p><h3> If You Have to Choose, Analyze Your Customer Base</h3><p> <br/> In a fictional world in which you truly had to choose (like the  <u>  <a href=\"https://inbound.org/discuss/would-you-rather-be-banned-from-google-or-have-zero-email-deliverability\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Inbound.org question  </a> </u> , &ldquo;Would you rather be banned from Google or have zero email deliverability?&rdquo;), the answer would be different for every business.</p><p> Does this mean you should analyze your data and pick one kind of marketing to focus on? Definitely not. You should never rely on just one source of lead generation because technology and marketing are always changing. You don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in one marketing method as it plunges down in value during a natural fluctuation. Instead, make budget decisions based on the data and monitor your marketing portfolio so that you can shift it according to the needs of your customers over time.</p><p> Hopefully, no business will ever be in a position to have to choose between these two marketing methods. But this question points us to an important concept that all companies need to consider: You don&rsquo;t need to ask, &ldquo;SEO or Email?&rdquo; so much as you need to ask &ldquo;What method of outreach is driving the most business?,&rdquo; and &ldquo;What other methods can support that outreach to maximize our marketing ROI?&rdquo;</p><p> The answer to those questions will help you develop a marketing portfolio mix that is customized to your specific customers and therefore as effective as possible.</p><p> Does your business rely on email marketing or SEO or a mix of both? How did you determine that mix?</p><p> <a href=\"http://inbound.rickwhittington.com/5-proven-components-of-a-b2b-lead-generation-campaign\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">  <img alt=\"\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SEO-or-Email.png\" width=\"832\"/> </a></p>",

    "content": "<h3> &ldquo;Measure what is measurable and make measurable what is not so.&rdquo; &ndash; Galileo</h3><p> <br/> For new partners, either starting a new venture or merging their businesses, few conversations are as difficult as discussing what the equity split will be. So, like any potentially messy conversation, it is often avoided.  The default is to go with an even split or a split that ensures control to a specific founder.  </p><p> When we see partners in serious trouble, with businesses that are in jeopardy because they can no longer work together, it is often because there is a sense of unfairness about contribution, compensation or control.  Often this can be traced to decisions made about how ownership will be split, almost always a time of great uncertainty about how the business will develop and without full discussion of the implications of the decisions.</p><h3> Making the Split Work</h3><p> <br/> What could partners do differently to head off the resentments that come with this sense of unfairness?</p><li> <strong>  Accept that no equity split is going to be fair all the time. </strong>   Even models that try to take a very dynamic approach to incorporate uncertainty will not add the stability needed for the venture to succeed without good communication among partners.</li><li> <strong>  Document not only the final equity split that is decided </strong> , but the process used to get to it. Include all factors that were included and how they were weighted.</li><li> <strong>  Decide on metrics to review the split at designated intervals as the business develops. </strong>   It is impossible to anticipate some of the ways in which a business will need to pivot once it is launched and having a plan in place to review the shares at an agreed upon time helps keep the focus on doing what is best for the business. <br/>  </li><p> All models, including the Owner&rsquo;s Equity Matrix that we use with our clients, require assumptions about how contributions will affect the success of the business. There are only a few inputs that are easily quantifiable: capital contributions, for example. The value of ideas, skills, opportunity costs, industry experience, and networks are subjective.  In the case of time commitments, there may need to be a discussion about productivity rather than hours spent working.  Agreeing on the value of these factors requires honest and sometimes contentious conversations among people who then have to work closely together. Too often, partners reach agreement with significant unspoken reservations because they are eager to launch the business.</p><p> Equity ownership among partners has long term financial implications and affects how partners perceive their role in the business on an ongoing basis.  As much as we would like it to be definitively encapsulated in a spreadsheet, it is important to understand that the dialogue that gets partners to their agreement is what makes ownership the foundation for a thriving business instead of a source of unresolved conflict. </p>",

    "content": "<p> To connect with your existing clients &ndash; and to reinforce your brand, communicate your value as an investment management firm and create new opportunities &ndash; it&rsquo;s high time that you craft tailored content specifically for them. We&rsquo;re talking about custom content. </p><p> A lot of your custom content will focus on answers to your clients&rsquo; questions &ndash; that&rsquo;s what makes it useful. Producing content like this sets your firm apart as a helpful, authoritative resource. Even better, custom content has a direct impact on fund sales and conversion rates. Let&rsquo;s explore.</p><h3> Your clients are looking for content</h3><p> A study from AOL &amp; Neilson captured how people spend their time on the web. It breaks down like this:</p><li> 53% reading published content</li><li> 23% on social media</li><li> 7% checking email</li><p> But here&rsquo;s the stat we really want to share: 23% of all social media messages included links to published content. How much does that add-up to? Well, people share 27 million pieces of content every day on social media. People share 27 million pieces of content each day on social media.</p><h3> Content levels</h3><p> Your firm is probably sharing content in one form or another. So, where does custom content fit into your broader content initiatives? This is how we break down content:</p><li> Curated, published content from reputable sources. For us financial services marketers, large North American news outlets, such as The Globe and Mail or The Wall Street Journal, are prime sources.</li><li> Firm-based content. This often includes product information, campaigns (e.g., RRSPs and RESPs) and portfolio manager perspectives.</li><li> Custom content. This is all about sharing your insights and expertise to a specific target audience (e.g., through infographics, videos, articles and blog posts).</li><p> When you put these three types of content together, you dramatically increase your chances of engaging your clients.</p><h3> Custom content builds relationships</h3><p> Why bother spending the extra time and money producing custom content? Because it provides a solid return on investment. Consider the following four data points when putting together your pitch for custom content:</p><li> 68% of consumers like custom content because it&rsquo;s tailored to their interests (Source: The Content Council)</li><li> 55% of consumers said they would be more apt to buy another product from a company that provides them with custom content (Source: The Content Council)</li><li> 70% of individuals want to learn about products through content rather than traditional advertising (Source: NewsCred)</li><li> Clients invest and refer 2 times more often when they report feeling engaged by their advisor (Source: Vanguard)</li><h3> Developing custom content</h3><p> Knowing about custom content is one thing, producing it is another. Here are eight ideas for launching a new custom content initiative at your firm:</p><li> Blogs &ndash; e.g., write a series of posts helping millennials save and invest better</li><li> Articles &ndash; e.g., create an advertorial highlighting the relevance of a new investment solution</li><li> Videos &ndash; e.g., produce videos that show how investing can make life better</li><li> Infographics &ndash; e.g., find an engaging way to share stats around retirement savings</li><li> Whitepapers &ndash; e.g., write a whitepaper explaining the shifting role of the advisor</li><li> Newsletters &ndash; e.g., craft print and digital newsletters focused on investor education</li>",

    "link": "switchback-ridge-a-cult-wine-for-the-rest-of-us",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> In 1999, at the height of the cult wine renaissance, a standout Napa Cabernet known as Switchback Ridge emerged from an exhaustingly overhyped market. A few years later, I attended a BYO wine dinner in Rutherford, New Jersey. In a sea of trophy wines, one wine stood out as the clear victor: the '01 Switchback Ridge Cabernet. The impetus behind this wine is the Peterson Family and Winery. In the wine world, conventional wisdom suggests that you \"buy the producer.\" This means that in the hierarchy of wine buying, the producer takes priority over the grape, vintage, and sometimes, even the property. In the context of Switchback Ridge, you are buying the Peterson Family...a worthwhile investment.</p><p> The winery began when John Peterson began working with legendary winemaker, Robert Foley, famous for his work at Pride Mountain. Their collegial relationship continues today, with managing partner, Kelly Peterson and the rest of the Peterson family. The Peterson Family Winery is a legitimate family business (you can't hear me, but I'm saying that in my best Don Corleone voice). </p><h3> Switchback Ridge is unapologetically robust, rooted in big fruit and high-alcohol percentages.</h3><p> <br/> They are sometimes accused of being \"Parkerized\" (world-renowned wine critic Robert Parker is said to have a predilection towards bold wines), but it is dismissive to think that Switchback Ridge Cabernets and Merlots do not age gracefully. That said, their Petite Sirah is a monster and should be kept chained in the basement! It too, ages well, but it takes years to realize its full potential.</p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Switchback-Ridge-Wine.png\" width=\"478\"/></p><p> Why the hell would anyone grow old vine Petite Sirah anyway? It takes up valuable land, produces low yields, and is susceptible to rot and viruses. At Switchback Ridge, the answer is simple. The family cares more about making wine than they do making money--It's conscientious winemaking at its best. The Peterson Family Winery is steeped in tradition and their block of old vine Petite Sirah serves as an homage to Kelly Peterson's late Great Aunt, Carrie. I don't know whose job it was to sell John Peterson (an old-school farmer) on the idea of cultivating a low-yielding crop, but I'm glad I didn't draw the short straw!</p><h3> Switchback Ridge is the perfect storm of wine production.</h3><p> <br/> The first thing you need to make great wine is great land. Like the saying goes, \"Buy real estate because they're not making any more of it!\" The Peterson Family Vineyard is located in the viticultural epicenter of Napa Valley. Unless your name is \"Mr. Seagrams,\" it's virtually impossible to buy land there. You also need a great wine maker like Robert Foley. You may have a really good wine, but once Bob \"tweaks it,\" you have an exceptional wine! Foley's relationship with the Peterson Family goes back many years. Suffice it to say that you can't just call him up and have him make wine for you. Apropos of his musical background, he's a \"rockstar\" in the industry. </p><p> <img alt=\"\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://www.iris.localhost.lan/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Switchback-Ridge-Caves_0.png\" width=\"504\"/></p><p> Despite its exceeding quality, Switchback Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon is less than a hundred dollars a bottle. When you consider the relative cost of Harlan Estate and Screaming \"That's not a telephone number, that's the price!\" Eagle, it's a very fair price for a world-class wine. </p>",

    "content": "<p> ll too often, clients and connections greet the referral question with a blank stare. They&rsquo;re caught off guard because they don&rsquo;t have a specific point of reference.</p><p> They would like to help, but they don&rsquo;t know where to begin.</p><p> Some advisors allow their referral strategies to become cumbersome and clunky. </p><p> Is that you? If so, practice drawing with confidence.</p><p> Be prepared to shoot straight and don&rsquo;t over-complicate referral requests. From my experience working with hundreds of advisors, we sometimes forget the value of the work we do for our clients.</p><p> When that mindset creeps in, we apologetically stumble through the referral conversation. Or worse, we don&rsquo;t have one at all. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of failing to clear the holster in a gun fight.</p><h3> Four questions to hit the mark on referrals: <br/>  </h3><h3> 1. Do you regularly promote referrals?</h3><p> Do your clients and your connections REALLY know that you&rsquo;re open for new business? Your best referral sources may be unaware of your plans for professionally growing your practice. <br/> Sure, they might offer your name to a friend who is looking for an advisor, but they aren&rsquo;t on the lookout for opportunities to proactively make introductions. They don&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;Open for Business&rdquo; sign hanging on your door.</p><h3> 2. Do your referrers really understand what you do?</h3><p> Most of the folks you know have a simplified understanding of your business. They don&rsquo;t see the full picture of what you do on a daily basis. Even your best clients may be biased by a single element of the most recent work you&rsquo;ve done on their behalf. You&rsquo;ll receive the highest quality referrals when your referral sources clearly understand what you do and how you do it.</p><h3> 3. Do you research potential referrals?</h3><p> A great way to eliminate blank stares when you&rsquo;re seeking referrals is to plant seeds in your referrers&rsquo; minds. Before you meet with your clients and connections, identify a few folks they may know. This way you&rsquo;re giving them a frame of reference for offering you their best referral advice. This takes a little advance homework, but it is well worth the time.</p><h3> 4. Are referrals a habit?</h3><p> Do you build referral-gathering opportunities into your daily routines? Any meaningful business growth activity that is not practiced consistently can go stale. This is particularly true of referrals. When you build referral-gathering into your daily routines your chance of success grows immeasurably.Need more referral strategies?</p>",

    "content": "<p> So, you want to learn more about finances. You care about your financial well-being and want to make sure you&rsquo;re making the right money moves. That&rsquo;s great news!</p><p> It should be easy enough to find answers in our overly connected world since a quick internet search can pretty much lead us to resources for anything we&rsquo;re curious about. However, leveraging the internet to solve some of your problems can quickly escalate into information overload as you probably know by trying to fix any career, health, or money problem you&rsquo;ve come across through the input of strangers.</p><p> In order to guard you from the overwhelm of options available, and since April is financial literacy month, I thought now would be a great time to give some pointers on how you can take the reins of your financial literacy.</p><p> Here are some immediate steps you can take in building your financial knowledge: </p><h3> Ask Questions</h3><p> The first step to taking control of your finances is to ask yourself some important questions. The most important one to start with is &ldquo;Why&rdquo;?  Why are you are ready to take the reins of your finances? Are you trying to overcome debt? Make sure you have a sound savings strategy? Trying to reach a very specific money goal?</p><p> What are those pressing financial questions you have and why are they important? &ndash; These are the types of questions that will help you find the right answers for you and your situation.</p><p> Once you&rsquo;ve determined your &ldquo;why,&rdquo; start asking questions of your financial habits, of the decisions that have lead you to where you are and also ask questions of any professionals you work with.</p><h3> Grab a Few Books</h3><p> Having sound resources handy will go a long way in providing you with the information you need to gain more understanding around important financial subjects. A few good financial books can offer clear explanations of complicated topics, advice on how to approach your finances, where to start, examples of concepts and real-life stories, and even helpful worksheets and resources that go along with the topics the book covers.</p><p> The good news is that books about personal finance are getting better! They aren&rsquo;t all boring text-book style anymore. In fact, you can get your hands on my new book: Work Your Wealth: 9 Steps to Making Smarter Choices with Your Money (shameless plug!) that I wrote as a useable resource that cuts through the crap, lays out an organized plan of attack, breaks down your financial steps into specific homework assignments along the way, and leaves readers with clarity and confidence in their financial life. I definitely recommend hopping over to Amazon.com to skim personal finance best-sellers for more book options!</p><h3> Seek Online Resources</h3><p> We are lucky having so much information available to us on the internet and online is a great place to go for continued learning. Between continuously updated blog sites like gogirlfinance.com and larger media companies like  <u>  U.S. News &amp; World Report </u>  and  <u>  <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   Yahoo! Finance  </a> </u> , you can get your eyeballs on plenty of helpful articles on anything you may want to know more about by skimming the latest headlines.</p><p> Other sites, like  <u>  <a href=\"http://www.mint.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">   mint.com  </a> </u> , provide tons of information and also make it easy for you to organize all your financial information in one place. Mint is an app that helps you effortlessly keep on top of it all and provides a lot of advice and guidance along the way.</p><h3> Have Money Conversations</h3><p> There really is a tremendous amount of learning that happens when we open up and talk to other people about finances. Whether it&rsquo;s having money conversations with your spouse, financial advisor or even your boss &ndash; it&rsquo;s important that you feel comfortable talking about money and asking questions. The more money conversations you have, the more comfortable you will become and the more you gain to learn about finances in general, as well as about what&rsquo;s important to you. You will even learn how you value your time and talents when you talk with employers about compensation and other work benefits.</p><p> Never pretend you know something when you don&rsquo;t. Ask your CPA, your boss, your attorney, your financial planner or whomever you have money conversations with for clarifying answers and information.</p><p> Money conversations serve as a conduit for greater understanding and clarity around your finances.</p><h3> Do Money Dates</h3><p> These can be as fun as they sound if you let them! A money date is a time when either you by yourself or you and your spouse get together for an hour or two to review your finances and have an open and honest conversation about what is going on in terms of spending, savings and goal progress.</p><p> Put your money dates on the calendar the same day every month and set it as a recurring meeting. Take the date seriously, but try to enjoy the transparency of what money dates provide: the ability to keep a pulse on how things are going so you stay on track and reach those important goals. P.S. no one said your money dates couldn&rsquo;t include a glass of wine!</p><h3> Check-in Every 6 Months</h3><p> Being intentional about your financial education is the secret to your success. It&rsquo;s what will keep you mindful about your money and always alert to powerful questions that help you become more informed to make the best financial decisions for you. Be sure to check-in with yourself every 6 months. This is intended to help you take stock in where you started, what you&rsquo;ve learned in the last several months, the progress you&rsquo;re making and new questions you may have about finances.</p><p> Taking the reins of your financial literacy is a choice you make and one that takes courage and dedication, and I&rsquo;m so excited for you if you decide to take control in this important area of your life.</p><p> Here&rsquo;s to you and a successful financial journey.</p>",

    "link": "is-it-harder-to-develop-the-lead-or-sell-the-lead",
    "source_link": null,
    "content": "<p> Any successful insurance agent knows that in order to remain competitive in this business, you&rsquo;ve got to have people to talk to &ndash; and not just any people, but good, exclusive qualified leads.</p><p> The generation of good insurance leads has in fact been the subject that haunts most struggling insurance agents &ndash; especially once they have depleted their initial &ldquo;warm natural&rdquo; market. In the past, if an agent was not able to prospect very well, he or she had a pretty slim chance of making it in this highly cut throat industry.</p><p> Today, however, there are ways that agents can help themselves &ndash; and actually prosper quite nicely &ndash; by having a list of &ldquo;ready to buy&rdquo; prospects in front of them every day. Rather than trying to find the proverbial needle in the haystack in terms of people who might be interested in their offerings, agents can now begin their days knowing that they&rsquo;ll be talking with individuals who at least have an interest in the coverage products that they have to offer. They can do this through buying their leads.</p><p> Insurance leads can be difficult to generate, though &ndash; and they don&rsquo;t always come cheap to the companies that are harnessing them and, in turn, providing them to the insurance agents. So, this raises an interesting question &ndash; is it harder to initially develop the lead or to sell the lead once it&rsquo;s been generated?</p><h3> Developing the Lead</h3><p> At first glance, this may sound like a &ldquo;which came first, the chicken or the egg&rdquo; type of question. After all, selling insurance has never been accused of being an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; profession to make a living in. But honestly, neither is generating exclusive life insurance leads.</p><p> The truth is that, as a life insurance lead generator, I can tell you from first-hand experience, it is a lot of work. Leads can be brought in based on a variety of different methods, including SEO, keywords, and pay-per-click advertising. Yet, because of the way in which Google is changing, it can be extremely difficult &ndash; especially for smaller companies &ndash; to keep up with the big brands.</p><p> So, just how difficult is it to develop the insurance lead?</p><p> Let&rsquo;s use an example of developing leads in my particular vertical. I&rsquo;m trying to develop leads, and also to generate exclusive leads for the life insurance niche. As a smaller player in the lead generation marketplace, I&rsquo;m actually competing against one of the hardest verticals for lead generation than any other.</p><p> For instance, I&rsquo;m going up against some of the most recognized names in the country, like State Farm, who &ndash; according to SEMrush &ndash; advertise for 37,700 keywords, and spend an estimated $2.8 million per month just on pay-per-click ads alone.</p><p> To give you an example of what their advertising efforts get them, State Farm ranks for 299,000 keywords. It also has the domain authority to rank on the first page for any keyword that they target. That&rsquo;s a lot of authority! But they&rsquo;re just one of the many that are in this vertical that I &ndash; one of the little guys trying to make it &ndash; are up against. Talk about some stiff competition!</p><h3> Helping Yourself</h3><p> A lot of your traffic &ndash; and conversion &ndash; can be accomplished (or not accomplished) through the copywriting that is used, as well as how and where keywords are strategically placed. Calls to action and Opt-ins can also be utilized, depending on the situation.</p><p> With so much competition there is a great deal of anxiety that can go along with developing leads, too. In this vein, you know that you have any number of agents relying on you for their bread and butter &ndash; especially because you know that the lead must be of good quality.</p><p> You also want to ensure that the leads will convert. Otherwise, the agent has just basically wasted his or her time. I think that this alone is one reason why developing leads can be much harder than selling them.</p><h3> Selling the Lead</h3><p> When it comes to selling the lead, there are also certainly both some challenges and some advantages for agents. But these can differ based on the individual agent, as well as what the primary focus is.</p><p> First, we&rsquo;ll look at the challenges. I don&rsquo;t think that any agent who has ever tried to sell a lead would disagree with the fact that there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of competition in this area. In fact, when I first started in the insurance business, I was purchasing what I thought were &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; leads &ndash; and maybe they were.</p><p> Unfortunately, even though the prospect was often ready to buy, I was also oftentimes competing with three or four other agents for the business &ndash; on the very same lead. None of these leads were exclusive. So, at $15 per lead, that became frustrating. What it did for me, though, was it gave me a sense of urgency in getting to the lead much faster if I wanted to make the sale!</p><p> Yet, even with the frustration and the urgency with selling leads versus developing them, there is still, in my mind, a great deal of advantage in that there is far less pressure knowing that all you have to do is sit back and wait for the leads to come in. I&rsquo;ve personally been on both sides of the gate, and I know that having qualified fresh exclusive leads each and every day can make life as an agent pretty nice &ndash; and because of that, there are agents who will pay good money in order to have a list of potential buyers waiting for them every morning out of the chute.</p><h3> Making the Process Work</h3><p> As someone who has done both, developing life insurance leads and selling leads, I will tell you developing the lead is much tougher than selling the lead.</p><p> As a lead generator, I know that in order to truly make the process work, though, the leads have got to be qualified. While this can be frustrating to an agent who is working to sell the lead, it can also produce additional pressure on a company that is working to develop a lead as well.</p><p> For the companies that are able to produce not just leads, but well qualified leads, this can become an extremely profitable business model. For example, over the past several years, several lead generation companies have sold for millions of dollars.</p><p> For example, in 2012, InsuranceAgents.com reportedly sold for the sum of $24 million to Bankrate.com. Bankrate has also purchased similar lead generation sites NetQuote, Insureme, and InsWeb. Just recently, BankRate then sold to All Web Leads a block of websites such as Netquote.com, among others, for an reported $160 million.</p><p> Developing quality life insurance leads today is literally a full-time job in and of itself. So, it is a rare individual or company that can both develop and sell leads at the same time successfully. My advice is that unless you have in-depth experience with SEO from an insurance industry standpoint, selling the lead may be the better way to go for most people.</p>",
